To highlight this new game mode, three VIP maps were included: Trainyard with a single capture point and a one-life VIP, Mineside with a VIP-exclusive briefcase that must be delivered to unlock the capture point, Harbor with three capture points and no special gimmicks, and a VIP version of Badwater Basin with four capture points (later reduced to three) and a nighttime atmosphere.\n\nAnother major feature was the addition of Four-Team mode, shattering the previous paradigm of RED and BLU by introducing GRN and YLW. The new Four-Team maps were the Arena map Flask, and a Domination version of Hydro - which itself is a new game mode, with Oil Canyon as a two-team exemplar. The update also brought back 9 new weapons based on unreleased Team Fortress 2 content, as well as 6 weapons and 31 maps that already exist in TF2.\n\nIn addition, most mechanics were rebalanced based on Team Fortress 2 updates, and the vast majority of the game was refactored in design, interface, and content. The prior \"deathmatch\" game mode was removed entirely, as well as numerous weapon concepts and aesthetic choices.
