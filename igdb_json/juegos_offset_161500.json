The personal totals of each player were added to a mass tally, and with each day of the update a running total score for each side was displayed on the update page. The Soldier won with 6,406,065 total kills to the Demoman's 6,372,979, granting the Soldier the prize of an extra unlockable weapon, the Gunboats.\n\nThe second competition was the Propaganda Contest. Users were encouraged to design propaganda posters for the side of their choice, supporting either the BLU Soldier or RED Demoman. The posters were then submitted to Valve to be judged through the Propaganda Contest website.
