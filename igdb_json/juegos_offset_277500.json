At the end of the corrido, Juan picks Maria Blanca as his preferred wife, while the other two women became the wives of Juan's brothers, Pedro and Diego. All three women had interesting backgrounds, but the way they were treated in the story left something to be desired. This is a manuscript that is often discussed in Filipino literature classes, but the portrayal of women — either as damsels in distress or prizes to be chosen — are not empowering. \n \nAdarna: The Legend of Maria Blanca re-imagines what it would be like if these princesses' lives did not revolve around Juan or his brothers. Many regions of pre-Hispanic Philippines had matriarchal societies, and while the first Adarna game released by Senshi.Labs had a very Western feel to it, this sequel attempts to transport the players back to an indigeous pre-colonial atmosphere while keeping the language somewhat up to date. \n \nThis adventure starts off in the Kingdom of Reinos de los Kristales, where the Princess Maria Blanca learns that her sister Isabela has fallen ill. A hermit approaches Maria to inform her that Isabela can only be cured by the mythical creature of Adarna. Maria then slips away from the kingdom and embarks on a quest to find the legendary bird.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1m8y.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120159,"name":"Tohu-Teka","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Turn Based RPG, following a high school student that mysteriously falls into a unknown fantasy world, where they must help the ongoing civil war, between an evil King and a willful rebellion.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120158,"name":"A.L.A.N.: Rift Breakers","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":120156,"name":"RoadRunner","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"RoadRunner - This is everyone's favorite Runner, where the player needs to run from point A to point B","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":120153,"name":"Witch","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"Witch\", an 2D-in-3D Indie JRPG coming soon from Heartstrings Studios!","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":120151,"name":"Cyber Racer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"One of a kind VR racing single/multiplayer game with easy driving controls and no motion sickness.
