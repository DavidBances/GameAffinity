Set in four distinct and treacherous realms, the game introduces a refreshing twist by allowing players to assume the roles of seven sinister anti-heroes, deviating from the typical \"good heroes\" seen in other games. Developed by the Slovakian team Darksoft Game Development Studio and the Czech company Cinemax, Necromania challenges players to navigate labyrinthine environments and overcome various enemies and creatures to acquire fragments of a powerful magic key.\n\nThe story centers around the fallen dark lord, Ragnar, who finds himself imprisoned by the forces of the Absurdian king, Bill Cocoton. In a bid to set Ragnar free and seize control of the realm, seven of Ragnar's loyal minions awaken from their slumber, each vying to obtain the magic keys that can unlock their master's prison. However, only one of them can ultimately lead the army of darkness to victory. As players progress through the game's numerous levels, they must strategize, laying traps and leveraging the intricacies of the environments to outsmart their adversaries.\n\nWhile Necromania: Trap of Darkness received mixed reviews, critics praised its multiplayer mode, even though finding opponents proved challenging. However, the game faced criticism for its unrefined gameplay mechanics and notable difficulty. The title offered an interesting blend of puzzle-like elements and combat, with an emphasis on trap utilization rather than direct confrontation. The lack of balance among the character classes and dated visuals added to the overall underwhelming experience. Despite its attempts to innovate, Necromania: Trap of Darkness fell short of leaving a lasting impression in the gaming landscape.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6qa7.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CINEMAX, s.r.o.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy First","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Darksoft Game Development Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":68966,"name":"Winglancer","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":68967,"name":"Airstrike II","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A horizontal scrolling shoot'em up similar to Scramble and the second game in the Airstrike series written by Steven Riding.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/km3usvoem8itwdykhxgz.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"}]},{"id":68968,"name":"Betasuppe","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Betasuppe is a quirky indie platformer/text adventure hybrid developed for a game competition.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":68969,"name":"Bazooka of the Red Dragon","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":68970,"name":"Electric Crayon 3.1: At the Zoo","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":68971,"name":"Onesimus: A Quest for Freedom","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":68972,"name":"Racing Madness","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":68973,"name":"Fly!

Winning the minigames earns the player additional tokens depending on the winning score. At least one minigame in each fairground section earns the player a special coin. After solving the puzzles in the park's office building, the player must use whatever clues gathered to find out which one of nine park employees is the thief who stole the deed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4a2y.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Imagination Pilots","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"WarnerActive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":69252,"name":"Technictix","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A music based game only released in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wsa.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Arika","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":69253,"name":"Sangoku Heroes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A turn-based strategy RPG for PC based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/y4ji2mdvcsmx4hearq5x.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69254,"name":"The Final Battle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Isometric point and click adventure game.

Renamed Phantasy Star Complete Collection, this version includes the Phantasy Star II Text Adventures series, released exclusively to the Sega Meganet network, with the first of the eight games (the one following the adventures of Rolf) available to be played without unlocking. It also includes the two Game Gear titles of the series, Phantasy Star Gaiden and Phantasy Star Adventure. Unlike the GBA version, it includes all four titles of the original series. While, unlike the Sega Ages titles Phantasy Star Generation 1 and Phantasy Star Generation 2, the games are mainly untouched, several options that are not available in the Sega Saturn version are included. These options can drastically alter the games, both visually (with graphical options ranging from changing resolution, interlacing, smoothness and scanlines) and in gameplay. The changes in gameplay can alter the speed of the characters (much like the option available for Phantasy Star II and Phantasy Star III in the Saturn version, but available to all games) and also the difficulty, by changing how much money and experience the player gets from fights, which can drastically reduce the time necessary to complete the games. There are also options to change the type of machine and localization of the games, making it possible to play them in their Japanese version as well as their English localized counterparts. This compilation was released on PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in 2012.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7zyt.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"M2","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":69268,"name":"Otsuge Uranai nan desu","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Otsugē Uranai nandesu is a fortune telling game, developed and published by Dorart, which was released in Japan in 2008.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8kqh.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Dorart","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]}]
