The player takes control of a spider who comes to reside in to the deserted Bryce Manor and must spin webs to trap various types of insects, whilst simultaneously ascertaining what happened to the former residents of the manor. The game received critical acclaim and won multiple awards. Originally released in August,[1] a Director's Cut update replaced the original version on the App Store in December. The update added ten new levels, twenty-four new Game Center achievements, new music, more story elements and a new insect (the hornet).[2] A year after the game's initial release, a HD version was released for the iPad.[3] In 2013, the game was also released for Android.[4] A sequel, Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon, was released in August 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac and Linux.[5]","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1v2j.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tiger Style","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":23260,"name":"Blades of Fury","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"3D arcade fighting game for the iPhone and iPod Touch, and the spiritual successor to \"Age of Glory: Medieval Combat\", a mobile phone game","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fxwk6llgtmtzhdowyovp.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":23261,"name":"Summer Sports Party","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"no info","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/umi8sso4iqqoz8icbder.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":23262,"name":"Mr.AahH!!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A streamlined platformer for the iPhone by Japanese developer PONOS.

You are now trapped in the Land of Keynesium.\n\nYou and your opponent are represented by the animated figures which appear at the lower right and the lower left of the maze entrance. The net worth of each figure is directly below it. Each player starts off with $500,000. Two Keynesian robots are in the center of the screen atop the maze entrance. Every maze is a game within a game. You and your opponent are playing against the robots which represent different factors of the economy. But you are also playing against each other. You will be changing strategies throughout the game - sometimes cooperating with the robots to thwart your opponent - sometimes collaborating with your opponent to beat the robots.\n\nEach maze offers you the opportunity to make money or the chance to hang onto what money you have. An electronic signal will appear center screen to tell you which to expect - and how much cash is at stake.\n\nThe right hand control unit activates the right hand figure. The left hand control unit controls the left hand figure. Push the joy stick away from you to make your player go up. Pull the joy stick toward you to make your player travel downward. Push right to go right. Push left to go left.\n\nThe Keynesian robots are controlled by the computer. The brighter robots represent the lighter side of the economy like income, bull markets and successful investments. These robots are elusive and will try to run from you - but the more quickly you catch them, the more money you'll make.\n\nThe darker robots represent the gloomier side of the economy - things like taxes, inflation and bear markets. They will try to catch you wherever you are in the maze. But the longer you stay away from them, the more money you'll keep. It's possible to find a hiding place in the maze where the darker robots can't find you.\n\nThere are seven kinds of mazes. INCOME, REWARD and INVESTMENT offer you an opportunity to make money. EXPENSES, THIEF, TAXES and INFLATION will force deductions from your net worth unless you completely elude the robots during these maze sequences. The amount of money at stake in each maze will appear at the lower center of the screen. After a moment, the numbers will start decreasing. The dark robots will speed up and the brighter robots will slow down as the $ at stake decrease. The number on the screen at the instant you make contact with a robot will be automatically computed into your net worth.\n\nYou will find that the Keynesian robots are small enough to maneuver freely through the mazes. But you are too tall to travel through some of the narrow passageways without ducking your head. You do this by pressing the action button on your hand control. It is harder to run in this position, so your player will only be going at two-thirds speed. If you do not press the action button when you make contact with a low ceiling in the maze, the computer will do it for you automatically, but you will only be able to run at half speed.\n\nThe walls and ceilings of the maze contain a high energy charge. If any part of your player's body comes in contact with any part of the maze, you must break that contact before proceeding with your run.\n\nDepartment of Dirty Tricks! Once you make contact with a robot, it is good strategy to harass your opponent. If you touch your opponent and a part of the maze at the same time, your opponent will lose control of his player.\n\nDepartment of Economic Cooperation! If you and your opponent outmaneuver the robots and make them run into each other, they'll automatically return to their starting positions. You'll gain both time and money.\n\nThe first player to achieve a net worth of more than one million dollars wins. The Keynesians will salute your triumph with a blast of electronic trumpets - and reward you with two tickets on the next time machine scheduled to make a stop in the Twentieth Century.\n\nShort games. You can play against the clock or with a goal of $750,000 instead of a million.\n\nLonger games. You can play for any dollar figure you choose. TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN has more than a trillion different maze combinations.

Welcome to the world of horse racing. While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market. \n \nThe player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for the last stretch sprint. It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed. \n \nDepending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/roy4xoonsbpyusii3c0e.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":23714,"name":"Chessmaster","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Chessmaster includes plenty of features to improve your chess skills, no matter what level you are.
