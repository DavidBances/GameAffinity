The game became a Greatest Hits title in 2003.[1] The game had a follow up titled Scooby Doo: Mystery Mayhem.\n\nThe game puts players in the control of Scooby-Doo in a story that revolves around him searching for the rest of the gang around a haunted mansion after they're kidnapped by an eccentric villain. The game has twelve areas, ranging from graveyards and secret labs to fishing villages and haunted mazes.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, mainly criticizing the game's simplicity, although its massive environments staying true to the Scooby-Doo! universe was praised by critics and fans alike. Fans of the original show loved the game, feeling it was compensation for the N64 game released in 2000. The game also marks the first and only time Don Knotts did voice work for a video game, though he did do previous voice work in the Scooby-Doo universe.[2]","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ozq.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Heavy Iron Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":81662,"name":"World Series Baseball","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"World Series Baseball 2K2, or World Series Baseball as it is known for Xbox, is a sports game developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega for the Dreamcast and Xbox.

A free, limited version is available for online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online. The goal of Lemonade Tycoon is to sell lemonade for profit.\n\nWhile selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. Lemonade Tycoon employs a concept called \"Game-On\" which allows users to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue.\n\nWhile Lemonade Tycoon is compatible with multiple platforms, the game differs slightly on each. The Windows version allows more details and info because of a larger screen. Locations had a much bigger view and other versions had to deal with a smaller screen. They did not include as much information as the PC. Areas would be cut down so only a portion could be seen. Each platform, however, is not limited in usability and functionality. Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition is also available on Mac OS X, published by MacPlay.\n\nThe last update (1.1.9) was called Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe because it included some new levels and a slightly better UI. In 2009 Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of Lemonade Tycoon.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nGame Modes\nLemonade Tycoon includes three game modes; Career, Challenge and Champion. Career mode lets the player have a stand for as long as they want. Challenge mode had a 30-day limit to see how fast your stand can grow within the period of time.\n\nStocks/Supplies\nIn order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.\n\nSales and Advertisement\nThe player has the option to advertise in Lemonade Tycoon. Every day, the player can pay an advertising fee with different choices in advertising being available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.\n\nUpgrades\nLemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at different prices. Some reduce wait times, some improve visibility, some make ice, etc. Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity. There are also employees, a cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.\n\nLocations\nThere are five different locations where one can move your stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each location has a different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity. Popularity changes as the player's stand gets more popular. Good satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures that customers will come back to the stand. If there are short lines, there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player's customer satisfaction will go up. With the increase of satisfaction, customers will come back to a player's stand. Satisfaction and popularity are location based. They do not travel with you as you move from location to location.\n\nGame Factors\nThere are many News Headlines that change how well lemonade is sold. Some headlines can improve your business and some that can hurt your business. Headlines change every game day and can sometimes only affect a single location. Weather affects how well lemonade is sold as well. Warm and hot days bring more customers to stand than on cold, rainy days. The weather changes each day and does not seem to follow predictable patterns.\n\nLemonade Stock Exchange (LSX)\nThe Lemonade Stock Exchange was an online feature that let one see how one's stand compared to others.\n\nRECEPTION:\n\nAwards\nBest Pocket PC Strategy Game (2002 Pocket PC Magazine's Best Products Awards)\nApplied uses\nLearning Planet, an educational website, created the original version of the game for teaching economics and resource management for its students.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature.\n\nThe Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech.\nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map.\n\nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature.

The Dreamcast version's distinguishing feature was that during the game's development, GunValkyrie utilized a unique control scheme using both a light gun and a controller. This control scheme was dropped when development shifted to the Xbox version.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from most third-person shooters, due to a unique dual analog control scheme, which is the main contributor to the steep learning curve of the game. Players travel to various worlds investigating the disappearance of several colonies, with only giant mutated insect creatures left behind. These insects comprise the bulk of the enemies you face along the way.\n\nPlayers control Kelly or Saburouta with both analog sticks, the left controlling forward/backward movement and turning, while the right aims their weapons, and when clicked, allows quick-turns. Clicking in the left stick while pointing in a direction causes the character to boost. The left trigger is a boost/jump, and when combined with the left analog boost, can be strung together into combos to keep the player off the ground entirely, which is a necessity for some levels. Face buttons are used to select weapons, and the right trigger fires the selected weapon.\n\nThe game comprises ten levels, the story unfolding via text between levels, or the occasional in-game cutscene. At the beginning of most levels, excluding boss battles, you have the choice of picking either Kelly or Saburouta. Kelly's primary weapon is fast but weaker, and she's overall faster and more maneuverable. Saburouta is slower, has more limited maneuverability in the air, and carries a stronger primary weapon, the Matchlock Cannon. Basically the two characters make up the two difficulty settings, with Kelly being the \"Normal\", and Saburouta being the \"Advanced\" setting. The real difference being that Kelly's style allowed several lock-on targets, while Saburouta's weapon splashed and was aimed at specific targets. Because of this, Kelly's gameplay is more frantic and requires less direct focus, while Saburota required specific aiming and direct attacks to be effective. Kelly is also the only character to upgrade her gearskin.\n\nThe artistic style of the game is similar to the steampunk subgenre of fiction, but the game's designers prefer to call it \"elec-punk,\" described as a step even further, with the harnessing of electricity for imaginative new uses. The game's stages are divided into indoor mechanical looking levels, with lots of gears and ornate metalwork, and outdoor stages, set in very organic looking valley's, craters, and other fantastic otherworldly locations.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7jvd.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Smilebit","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":6446,"name":"Ice Age","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ice Age makes the jump to the small screen in this Game Boy Advance platformer.

Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring \"stroke-shaded\" animation-style graphics, a \"Wild West\" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2.\n\nWild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The \"drifters\" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.\n\nAs the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed \"expressive communication\" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair.\n\nWild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons & a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wi4.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Media.Vision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Contrail","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":49336,"name":"Jonny Moseley: Mad Trix","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Jonny Moseley's bringin' new-school skills to the world's first trick-based skiing game!
