In some modes holding or defending a flag is the primary goal, where in others it is simply to obtain the most frags. For all game modes, the basic objective is to kill enemy players. Before spawning, the player is presented with a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. A few grenades and a molotov cocktail are also supplied by default and more grenades can be picked up from the ground. Some servers enable secondary functions like knives, shields or nuclear kamikaze attacks. Upon death players leave behind a health pack for healing injury, the weapon and any equipped grenades for others to pick up. After waiting for a server-specified amount of time (usually less than five seconds), players respawn and may choose another weapon—this cycle repeats for the duration of the map. After a certain allotted time (usually 15 minutes), the map changes and scores are reset as players continue in another round.

Points are awarded for accuracy with bonus multipliers awarded for making certain 'combos' (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long). This is a game for one or two players with three difficulty settings, easy, hard and medium. The player selects their difficulty level and their track and then attempts to score points by hitting the correct buttons in sequence. During the song the player is treated to an distant view of an animated disco dancer on a stage and illuminated with coloured lights. Once the track is over the player can enter their name, assuming they have achieved a high score. The game holds eight scores for each of the three difficulty levels but no scores are recorded for Workout and Recorder modes. The game has a workout mode in which the player first enters their weight, in kilograms, and then selects a track. Gameplay here is basically the same as the main game but instead of points the game calculates the number of calories burned. There is no difficulty setting for this game mode and the arrows come thick and fast. The Recorder option allows the player to create and save their own dance, there is no high score for this and while the dance moves are preserved from one game to the next only one routine can be saved.

The computer has a timeline of the crime saved which is used to find discrepancies in the statements of the suspects and unaccounted time. Finally the map shows all locations which are relevant to the investigation.\n\nBefore the interrogations the player has to choose up to three topics.

Vol. 2: Reminisce is the second entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2vtc.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CyberConnect2","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco Bandai Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":7136,"name":"Project Sylpheed","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Project Sylpheed is an arcade-style shooter and is the follow-up to Silpheed: The Lost Planet on the PlayStation 2.

However, there are a number of groups who object to Earth's rule and desire independence; four of them have joined forces and formed a rebel group called the ADAN Freedom Alliance. The main characters in the story are Katana Faraway, Ellen Bernstein, and Margras Mason; all are young pilots having just joined the Earth's military, the Terra Central Armed Forces (TCAF). Following a suspicious accident, Margras joins the opposing ADAN forces to fight against his former friends and home planet. You control Katana in the game, and as missions are completed the story progresses.\n\nWhile previous Silpheed games utilized a top down view of the action, Project Sylpheed features a fully 3-D view from either just behind your ship, or a first person view from within it. During the game you'll need to complete a series of missions; these are varied and include having to destroy all opponents in an area or defend an allied ship from attack. Initially there are fewer enemies and you don't have powerful weaponry, but as the game progresses the enemy increases in count and abilities and you can upgrade your ship with more powerful weapons. During a mission several sub-objectives may also become available which can be completed (some of the sub-objectives also unlock Xbox 360 Achievements when completed).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co82zc.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SETA","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":1560,"name":"Pokémon Diamond Version","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pokémon Diamond Version and Pearl Version are role-playing games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS.

Immediately afterwards he receives a call from his ex-girlfriend, who tells him a girl has been kidnapped, and sends him a picture of that girl. To his astonishment, Kojiroh realizes this is the very same girl he just saw on the street... Meanwhile, Marina encounters a young man who jumps from the roof of a high building in front of her eyes. Examining the body, Marina notices a strange tattoo on the young man's hand. What was the reason for the suicide? What is the meaning of the tattoo? And how is this case connected to the one Kojiroh is investigating? Like all the previous EVE games, this is a traditional Japanese adventure without puzzles. The standard menu-based and point-and-click interfaces are replaced by a new one; whenever you have the freedom of action, you press a combination of buttons on your gamepad. For example, circle button and the left directional button pressed together will make you examine the objects you see to your left, etc. True to the tradition of EVE series, you control both Kojiroh and Marina. You can switch between their scenarios at any time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co49yp.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":67099,"name":"Guitar Freaks & DrumMania: Masterpiece Silver","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Japanese only release by konami","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7391.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":56521,"name":"Ayakashibito: Genyou Ibunroku","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A port of Ayakashibito originally on PC.
