Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen, which is common for other games of this type, the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen, however.\n\nOccasionally, items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle, adding more balls, extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars, the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle, causing more damage to blocks. If the player finds four stars, this charged up bounce will clear the screen.\n\nSkulls can often drop from blocks too, and collecting these will lower a green gauge at the side of the screen, which operates as a combined timer/health bar.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co307w.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":5550,"name":"Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tactics Ogre is a 3D isometric tactical role-playing game.

The reason for this is because the original actors for them were released from contract after the events of the Power Transfer two-parter episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Sega and Banpresto asked for permission from Saban Entertainment to use their characters but have the three replacements use their voices instead of Jason, Trini, and Zach.

Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control. To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air. He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth. As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity. What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too. This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you. If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn). Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co305c.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":178053,"name":"BS Zelda no Densetsu: Dai-4-wa","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The fourth and last part (week) of the first map of BS Zelda no Densetsu.\n\nBS Zelda no Densetsu was a remake of The Legend of Zelda that was released for the Satellaview attachment of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co40qx.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"}]},{"id":79448,"name":"Chrono Trigger: Music Library","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Music Library is a downloadable add-on to Chrono Trigger for the Satellaview.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co43nv.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"}]},{"id":37882,"name":"Kyouraku: Sanyo - Toyomaru Parlor!

Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long.

They're waiting for you with combat helicopters of their own, backed up by radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and missiles and fixed wing aircraft.

The developers constructed the flight model with fanatical attention to detail, going so far as to bring in Apache pilots to fly the in-game chopper and offer their feedback on how real the experience felt.

The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.\n\n\"Mystic Ark\" is a RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8o92.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":38267,"name":"Kat's Run: Zen-Nippon K-Car Senshuken","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Race to the finish!

The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.\n\nThe North American version of the original arcade release is much different than the other versions. One of the most major changes in this version is that Bub and Bob were removed from the game and replaced with a pair of disembodied hands. Also, the characters that were in the Vs. CPU mode were removed and replaced with a generic computer. The backgrounds from the original version were also removed and replaced with 15 new backgrounds, but this also means that the backgrounds get looped in the Puzzle mode, which is 30 stages long.

These items are dropped by enemies and can also be used to perform a special attack when the character is morphed in Ranger Mode. A Special code made for the game can have the players begin the stages as the morphed Rangers instead of their civilian persona. Once the Morphin' meter is filled, the player can press the special attack button to morph; an animated sequence begins showing the rangers morphing in a digitized video (Based of the Season 2's transformation without showing the Red Ranger helmet configuring at the end). The method also occurs automatically after the player goes throughout the mission in civilian mode encountering the boss triggering the morph sequence (regardless of how much energy of the morphin' meter is filled up).\n\nThe game consists of seven stages. The player fights against Lord Zedd's Putty Patrol until reaching the end of stage boss.
