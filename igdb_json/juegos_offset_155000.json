Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.\n\nL.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.\n\nIn addition to the original full game, L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition for PC will include a multi-use code to access all the previously released downloadable content from the console versions, including the “Nicholson Electroplating” Arson case, the “Reefer Madness” Vice case, “The Consul’s Car” Traffic case, “The Naked City” Vice case and “A Slip of the Tongue” Traffic case.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ldm.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Team Bondi","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Rockstar Leeds","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Rockstar Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":47380,"name":"Happy Feet Two","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Happy Feet Two - The Videogame is a 3D musical adventure game for the entire family inspired by the whimsical Antarctic world of the animated film Happy Feet Two.

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gkj.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Genki","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kojima Productions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Armature Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bluepoint Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":20244,"name":"Deepak Chopra's Leela","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Experts in meditation have created an innovative game concept inspired by the ancient system of chakras - the body's seven energy centers through which the life force flows - and challenges players to achieve a peaceful and focused \"flow state.\" As they make their way through a visually stunning environment, players practice playful yoga-inspired activities, breathing exercises and meditation.

Rather, Survival is designed more as an action-adventure game with Cabela's-themed hunting elements.\n\nThe story revolves around Logan James, a private pilot flying a doctor (Doctor West) though Alaska to deliver highly important cargo to an important destination--where people's lives are at stake! Unfortunately, sans flight plan and going into a storm, the plane crash lands near Katmai Mountain and forces the pilot to venture into an adventure to survive and escape the mountain alive and with their important cargo intact. Wild animals such as bears, wolves, cougars and even birds threaten survival, and require the pilot to dredge up any hunting and survival skills he has.\n\nThe game is designed to be compatible with the Top Shot Elite gun peripheral, and as such, there is a targeting cursor onscreen that the player uses to hunt or even use some equipment, with all the aiming done manually with the Top Shot Elite. With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar to a Third-Person Shooter. The player has the ability to perform \"Focus Shots\" which slow down time and allow for visible placement of internal organs of the animal being hunted or defended against.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5x5m.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"FUN Labs","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision Value","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":6648,"name":"Cabela's Adventure Camp","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Crafted to be a party game, Cabela's Adventure Camp, like Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai, appears as a rather unconventional Cabela's-themed title. Rather than the typical heavy emphasis on hunting, firearms, and dangerous animal species, Adventure Camp focuses on the more \"outdoorsy sportsman\" and camping aspects of the Cabela's brand. Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles.\n\nThere are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are \"attending\" a Cabela's-themed camp. Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or obstacles are \"blamed\" on the character.\n\nEvents in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more \"unusual\" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the classic electronic game Simon. The other is a variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors called \"Bear-Hunter-Ninja\" and requires the players to stand in predefined stances to pose as a Bear, a Hunter, or a Ninja. Aside from the Whack-a-Mole and Bear-Hunter-Ninja games, all the other games have at least two variations, typically a different course or set of challenges, and can be played by two to four players.

Although non-canon, the game contains many easter eggs and references that connect Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate together.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6bl6.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MAGES.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NITRO PLUS","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"5pb.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":64757,"name":"Gamebook Adventures 7: Temple of the Spider God","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gamebook Adventures 7: Temple of the Spider God is the seventh Gamebook Adventures game from Tin Man Games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pxphwkowfjjzsepo6ta4.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":53219,"name":"Hunter's Trophy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This PS3 hunting game is built around the use of the PlayStation Move.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fpau51eo7cq8yuu20xbu.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bigben Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":21726,"name":"NCIS","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"For the first time ever, the world of the NCIS TV show comes to your living room in an all-new NCIS story arc written with the writers of the show.

It is the first Family Feud video game to be released on Xbox 360 and the third to be developed on Wii by Ludia Inc.\n\nIn Family Feud, one hundred people were surveyed and gave answers to various questions. Two families then battle each other by trying to guess the top answers to each question. In each round, a member of each family is asked to join the host on the center of the stage to answer one question. The quickest player to buzz in gets to answer first. If he/she doesn't give the number one answer, the other player can give his/her answer as well. Whoever has the best answer will then decide to either \"play\" or \"pass\". If the player decides to play, his/her family will have to guess all the answers to win the round. If the player decides to pass, the opposing family will have to find all the answers.\n\nEach wrong answer results in a strike. After three strikes, the other family has a chance to steal the points. To do so, they must find one correct answer that hasn't already been given. When all the rounds are over, the family with the most points gets to play \"fast money\". In \"fast money\", the player is asked to answer the five same questions twice (or in multiplayer mode, two players can each answer the set of five questions). If the player gets 200 points or more in the \"fast money\" round, he/she wins $20 000!\n\nFamily Feud: 2012 Edition includes over 2000 survey questions, three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), a party mode with up to 4 players, bonus videos featuring Steve Harvey and lets the player play as his/her avatar on Xbox 360 or Mii on Wii.\n\nIn challenge mode, 1 to 4 players can play cooperatively against 16 different families. Each family has its own themed alcove (a beach, a mansion, a spaceship, a prehistoric den, a haunted house, a private boat, a bowling alley, etc). In party mode, 2 to 4 players can compete against each other.\n\nKinect features were developed for the game on Xbox 360, but were eventually dropped as they didn't add any fun factor to the game.

The game and another game, Too Human, were recalled, and had their unsold copies destroyed due to legal issues between Silicon Knights and Epic Games over the games' use of Unreal Engine 3 code.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2cnk.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Silicon Knights","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":4651,"name":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2012","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 (abbreviated to PES 2012 and known officially as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2012 in Asia) is a video game which is the eleventh edition in the Pro Evolution Soccer series developed and published by Konami (and MicroByte in Argentina) with production assistance from the Blue Sky Team.
