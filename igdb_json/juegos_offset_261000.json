A copy of the nearly complete game surfaced in the collection of a former Telesys employee in 2007.

The only known prototype of Bouncin' Baby Bunnies seems to be fairly complete, but still needs some tweaks and bug fixes. The game didn't get released because of the collapsing game market of 83/84.

Care Bears made it to the beta testing stage before the marketing department decided to stop work on the game citing that the market for childrens games was diminishing, and the gameplay was too dull. Therefore it was decided that all further development on the game was to be stopped. According to programmer Laura Nikolich, part of the reason Care Bears was killed off, was that the marketing department really didn't know what they wanted. The Care Bears product line was aimed at the 8 and under age group, but marketing wanted a more action oriented game designed for older kids. Although Nikolich described the game as being almost finished, the only known prototype to surface is nothing more than a graphics demo.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mfl.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Parker Brothers","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":282635,"name":"Fantasyland 2041 A.D.","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are visiting Fantasyland - the theme park of the future.

And, caught in the middle, good and kind people who are in the end but innocent sacrifices.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mi8.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Witch","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":282658,"name":"TwinBee","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An unlicensed port of the MSX version of TwinBee, released in Taiwan by Jumbo.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mia.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jumbo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"SG-1000"}]},{"id":282659,"name":"MotoGP","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"MotoGP puts you behind the handlebars of some of the fastest machines on two wheels.

Wings is an air combat simulation that uses a control scheme of two joysticks. The first joystick controls your plane and the second controls access to your weapons. It was originally assumed the game would use the CBS Booster Grip controller, due to a prototype box that shows Wings packaged with the controller. Wings features a fairly sophisticated control panel (for a 2600 game), containing seven different gauges that let you keep tabs on your fuel, power, airspeed, altitude, radar, horizon, and compass. Two different versions of the prototype binary exist, one NTSC and one PAL. The NTSC version of the game is dated four months earlier than the PAL version, and is noticeably different. The NTSC version is playable, but is missing the enemy planes and has numerous bugs. The PAL version is more complete, featuring a nice Wings logo and enemy planes, but also contains a bug that causes the game to crash if you continually pull back on the joystick while taking off. In addition, some of the gauges in the PAL version are not function.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mje.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":282666,"name":"Sweet Ange","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mjh.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":282667,"name":"Telepathy","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's failed Mindlink controller. The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port. The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make. Atari actually claimed that the Mindlink could read the player's thoughts. The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day. After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled. Telepathy was actually developed as a demo to show what kind games the Mindlink could do. This \"demo\" is made up of seven different action screens held together by a loose \"mine\" theme. Thankfully Telepathy is playable without the Mindlink controller (unlike Bionic Breakthrough) by pressing the joystick button.

It is unknown if any work was already done on the U.S. Games version or if any of those ideas were used in the Probe 2000 version of the game.

When the first batch of chips came back defective from the manufacturer NAP decided to cancel the game rather than try and find a new source for the chips.

You must fly down to the ground and pick up McDonald's food to bring up and feed the aliens, but certain aliens will only eat certain McDonald's fast food (shakes, fries, hamburgers) so you need to feed them the right food. If you don't feed them in time, they start to eat the Golden Arches, but not to worry, you can fly back down to the ground and pick up pieces to rebuild the Golden Arches'.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mp6.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":282743,"name":"Mazy Match","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Try to reach the symbols at the top of the screen before you run out of energy by walking an invisible path on a randomly generated grid while avoiding UFO's and rocks dropped by birds.

Thankfully all this changed when former Atari 2600 programmer Anthony Henderson happened to stumble across his long lost copy of Turbo while searching his attic. According the programmer, Coleco originally wanted the game to use paddle controllers in order to better simulate a steering wheel. However reading the input from paddle controllers takes up considerably more clock cycles than reading regular joysticks, and there was not enough time to animate the road edges. After pleading with Coleco, they were allowed switch the game from using paddles to joysticks, which freed up enough time to insert the road edge movement but the game was cancelled before it was actually implemented. Other missing features include the ambulance, water puddles, and the enemy car AI (although implemented in the current prototype, it was never tweaked and finalized). The game difficulty also needed to be tweaked a little as dodging oncoming cars in this version is more a matter of luck than skill. According to the programmer there was actually one more revision of the game completed before the project was cancelled that included moving trees on the sides of the road on the curve stages. It is unknown what happened to that particular prototype. Turbo didn't get released because of a car accident. Lead programmer Michael Green was hit by a drunk driver while riding his bike and was seriously injured. Since he couldn’t work on the game while recovering in the hospital, the deadline came and went without the game being finished. As it turns out the game was already behind schedule due to the time spent by the programmers switching the control scheme from paddles to joysticks. By the time things got rolling again, the game market had started to collapse and the Coleco declined to release the game. Interestingly, many years later Atari bought up the entire Coleco VCS library of games including Turbo. While Atari only ended up re-releasing a handful of Coleco titles, Turbo was put on the master part list. It is unknown if Atari was considering finishing up Turbo, or if they simply added it to the list before knowing that it was incomplete.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mpb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":282745,"name":"Treasure Below","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"There's fabulous golden treasure down there, just waiting to be taken.

Although the game was found a long time ago, the rom had not been dumped until quite recently so the game is still a bit of a mystery. The only known version is very incomplete with little gameplay implemented, but rumors persist of a far more complete version in existence. The game only consists of one screen in which you control Charlie Brown as he flies his kite around the screen. At the bottom of the screen there's a wind gauge which shows the speed and direction of the wind. There's also a timer a the bottom of the screen which slowly counts up which may be part of the scoring system (based on total time instead of score). You goal is to fly your kite as long as possible while avoiding birds, balloons, rockets, and of course the deadly Kite Eating Tree. According to the catalog description, if Charlie Brown lost his kite he would have to earn another chance by raking leaves (what fun!). Obviously, this part of the game was not implemented yet. Pushing the joystick left and right moves Charlie Brown around the screen. Pushing up and down will let out or pull in the kite string, thus making the kite move up and down. If the kite hits an obstacle the game will freeze for a moment and Charlie Brown will have to start again, but if the kite hits the Kite Eating Tree, Charlie Brown will actually flip over and all the balloons will turn black due to the fact that they share a color pallet with Charlie Brown and gets glitched up when he flips over. Occasionally what appears to be lightning will flash in the background, but doesn't seem to have any adverse effects other than scaring the player (I actually jumped the first time this happened). The lightning only appears if you move your kite into the clouds and it increases if you move into the higher layer of clouds. Interestingly, it appears that by using the second joystick, the player has some limited control of the room of balloons. This could be the start of an unfinished two player variation of the game (code hints at four possible variations), but it is very preliminary in this prototype. There are no sounds or music in this version of the game, but this isn't surprising since sounds and music were usually one of the last things to finished. The graphics appear to be top-notch, but are slightly glitchy. For example, the clouds appear to randomly disappear and reappear at various times during the game. The row of birds also appears to suffer from this, but not to the same degree as the clouds. This is obviously a sign that the game was still early in development.. According to the catalogs Good Luck Charlie Brown was supposed to be to released Summer of 83, and since this prototype is dated April of 84 we can assume development was taking longer than expected. By 1984 Atari had canceled the Children's series so Good Luck Charlie Brown would have been cancelled with it. It's a shame though, because what was finished looks rather interesting.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mpx.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":282762,"name":"Grover's Music Maker","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Grover's Music Maker was originally called Monkey Music and featured a dancing monkey instead of Grover.

Found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko, the identity of this mysterious Activision prototype has eluded collectors for years. This prototype plays like a cross between a Rubik's Cube and the old sliding tile puzzle game. The goal of the game is to line up all the colors in each row from light to dark. If you've done it correctly the board should look like the start-up screen with the colors descending from red to purple. However lining up all the colors is easier said than done due to the unique way the squares move across the board. When you move your square up or down a row or column, the last square in that row will move behind your square's new position. For instance if your square is the light green one (center of the row), and you move it left it will result in the last square in the row (the light blue one) moving behind it. If you move right instead, the last square on the right (the dark blue one) would move behind your square. Mastering how the squares move is essential to solving the puzzle. If you forget what order the squares should go in, pressing the fire button will cause all the squares in the correct positions to turn black. While this is helpful for positioning the shades of color in each row, it won't help you remember what color is supposed to go in each row.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mqb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":282770,"name":"Shooting Arcade","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shooting Arcade is one of only two Atari 2600 games to use the Light Gun (Sentinel being the other), but was never released.

Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode. It is unknown why Ixion was never released by SEGA, but it was around this time that SEGA Enterprises (the American arm of SEGA) was sold to Bally. After this sale, all of SEGA's 2600 titles were Bally/Midway arcade games (Tapper, Spy Hunter, and Up 'n Down). It may have been felt that only well known arcade game would sell well enough in the overly competitive 2600 market, or perhaps Ixion simply got lost in the transition shuffle.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mql.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":282778,"name":"Stargate","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender.

By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect). Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop. One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down.

From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different. Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay. However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet... Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise. Like I said, this game is weird!. Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete. There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay. The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud. Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom). The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern. As you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers. These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation. The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game. The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number. It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle. Although the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay. Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke. It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things. Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot. It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype. Although Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise. Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found. Only one prototype of Kyphus is known to exist. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. A picture of the box was shown in a few Apollo advertisements. It appears to show a wizard battling evil clouds in a temple which is fairly close to the gameplay in the current prototype.

However, while you can just start shooting willy nilly, you should probably take a second to look at the funny little targets in the middle section of the screen. In the middle section of the the screen there are three rotating mirrors. As you may have guessed, these mirrors can play havoc with your laser if you're not careful. If you shoot a mirror while it is facing you, it will reflect the laser back at you and you will lose some time and be momentarily stunned. However if you shoot the mirror while its back is to you, you can destroy it so it won't bother you until the next round. While this may sound a bit complicated, it's often best just to ignore the mirrors and shoot at the targets themselves.

The head can blink or nod up and down, the arms can either flap or pump up and down, and the legs can kick out or squat.

There is evidence of this as prototypes for other children's games such as Peek-A-Boo and Honker Bonker fall into this part number range. This prototype even uses the Kid's Controller, which further supports this theory.

Unfortunately this house is infested with mice which roam the screen, gnawing through pipes and generally causing problems for our man Tom. Once a mouse gnaws through a pipe, you'll see the flow of water stop and a pipe piece will fall to the ground. To repair the pipe Tom must pick up the fallen piece (you can hold two pieces a time), and put it back into the hole. To get to where the holes are, Tom must carefully climb up and navigate the maze of pipes. Although Tom can cross short gaps in the pipes, he'll need to go around the larger ones. While climbing around on the pipes, Tom will run across several different kinds of mice. Each mouse has its own color and purpose. When the flow of water is interrupted, the timer in the reservoir will begin to count downward from 5000 at the rate of 100 points per second. The only way to stop this countdown is to restore the water flow by fixing the pipes. If the timer reaches zero, Tom will lose a life and play the current level over again. If Tom is able to get enough water into the reservoir (keeping the timer above 1500), he'll be rewarded with a bonus intermission showing a woman taking a shower. - Excerpt from","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7muz.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"}]},{"id":282834,"name":"All-Star Baseball 2004","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Like Derek Jeter, All-Star Baseball 2004 is the game \"with all the tools.\" With the most realistic simulation ever, easier to play functionality, and the same all around skill set that makes Derek the leader and winner he is, ASB 2004 truly is the game with all the tools.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co84pp.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Acclaim","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":282836,"name":"100 Capitalist Cats: Extra Content","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"By purchasing DLC, you will get extra content in the game 100 Capitalist Cats.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"100 Cozy Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":282837,"name":"Rebaixados Elite Brasil Clássicos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rebaixados Elite Brasil Clássicos is a Brazil-inspired demoted car game where you can customize your antique car and character!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7muw.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sebby Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":282838,"name":"Forgotten 13","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A freelance reporter goes to a quiet suburban neighborhood to investigate the disappearances of 13 people between 1963 & 1987.

The attack methods and durability vary depending on the possessed body, so the key to the strategy is which creature you possess as you continue your search.

Sirius' existence has been known for some time, as a physical prototype has been in hands of a collector for years, but this prototype was known to be unstable and crash frequently. The source code for Sirius was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware. Sirius is a horizontally oriented space shooter that will feel right at home to those familiar with games such as Gradius and R-Type. The game consists of four different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Sirius deftly demonstrates what the 7800 hardware is capable of and compares favorably with NES and Sega Master System games of the time. Unfortunately, Sirius is aggravatingly difficult and will require much practice and patience to succeed through all four levels. Sirius is a single player game only. The difficulty level (easy and hard) can be selected via the left difficulty switch. Sirius has several different types of weapons power-ups. The first is a \"ghost ship\" that follows you and fires when you fire. Other power-ups include rapid fire guns and rapid fire plus spread fire. You can pick up one extra of each power-up type for reserve so that when you are killed you won't be quite so vulnerable. There are also diamonds that you can pick up but they don't seem to do much other than reward you 300 points. A partially compiled version of Sirius was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Sirius was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7n1x.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 7800"}]},{"id":282938,"name":"The Mandela Experience","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Experience The Horrors From Mark's Perspective In This Short Visual Novel RPG Maker Game","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7n21.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Shattered Eye","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":282940,"name":"The Great Sea Battle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Great Naval Battle is a traditional naval combat strategy that probably everyone knows, but in a 3D computer format.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7n22.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Big Fish Games, Inc","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":282941,"name":"Metal Storm: Collector's Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An official patched re-release of Irem's cult classic platforming shooter Metal Storm sold by Retro-Bit.\n\nIn this enhanced edition, they integrated elements that had been cut off from the original Famicom release to be enjoyed on original hardware worldwide.\n\nThis re-release included additional collector goodies such as a statuette, a poster, a novelty box, and an enamel pin.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7n23.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Limited Run Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Irem","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"retro-bit","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":282943,"name":"Skullman Kills","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A boss rush game based on the Megaman series.\n\nSkullman has attained full sentience and has decided he's had enough with Dr. Wily.
