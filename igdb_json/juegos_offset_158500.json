The player takes control of the character known as Courier 6, who, preceding the start of the game, is hired by a delivery service called the Mojave Express to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip. The game starts during the delivery, where the Courier is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, the player becomes caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants.\n\nEven though it directly succeeds Fallout 3 in order of Fallout game releases, offers a similar action role-playing experience, and shares its engine and legacy content with Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a direct sequel. It marks the return of some elements found in Fallout 2. The game was a critical and commercial success, shipping more than 5 million copies altogether.

When Aziraal's tomb was opened at the end of the first game, the god's powers transferred to our hero's sister. Now the dark lord Gandohar, determined to have Aziraal's power for himself, has taken our hero and his sister captive and is draining those powers from her. The escape from the prison acts as a tutorial for the game until the hero finally steps out into Antaloor.\n\nThere is a huge world to be explored containing deserts, forests, swamps, seashores, cities and rural areas, plus many hidden caves and dungeons. There will be encounters with every kind of monster imaginable from killer insects to huge beasts, as well as humanoid enemies of varied races. Since the levels of the enemies are not tied to the player's level, some fights need to be avoided until the hero advances and increases his abilities. The game boasts that there are enough quests to keep players busy for about 100 hours.\n\nIn the single-player game, the hero can be a male only. His specialty (warrior, ranger, mage) can be changed at will by swapping equipment. Success as each is entirely dependent upon how earned skill points are assigned.\n\nTwo Worlds II features improvements over the first game including new user interface, game engine and magic & crafting systems. It includes all of the gameplay elements that were part of Two Worlds I (riding on horseback, crafting, forging, alchemy). Sailing (planned for the first game, but never released) is possible in this game, albeit in only a few locations.\n\nFeats and skills can be learned to enhance each form of combat. Learned spells can be combined with each other using the new card modifiers to enhance or change their effects. Improvements to the crafting/forging aspects make it possible to improve weapons and armor differently. For instance, objects in inventory can be broken down to their base elements (cloth, wood, iron).\n\nTwo Worlds II also offers five multiplayer modes for up to 8 players: Crystal Capture, PvP, Dual, Adventure (7 chapters), and a Village mode. In multiplayer, new characters are created with a choice of several races and can be male or female.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21m8.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"TopWare Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Reality Pump","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":5272,"name":"We Sing Robbie Williams","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"For the first time ever Robbie Williams is set to star in his own singing video game.\n\nWe Sing Robbie Williams will feature 25 tracks from the chart-topping artist, which will be accompanied by all the original videos making it a true celebration of the British born, multimillion selling pop star.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pkssj9gjybyq14l6xsj0.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Le Cortex","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nordic Games Publishing","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":4813,"name":"Doctor Who: Return to Earth","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Doctor and Amy arrive on the deserted starship the Lucy Gray, which was the first ship to return to earth after the solar storms of the 26th century.

During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower.

Throughout these movies the protagonist is tasked with defeating enemies, freeing the civilians and putting on the best possible performance by activating motion-based power-ups. The player can shoot into the floor to send out a shockwave to vanquish all enemies on the screen. It is also possible to spin on the spot to slow down time and get a more accurate shot. Shooting into the sky activates Rampage, a powerful machine gun.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co937u.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cohort Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":10583,"name":"Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Nancy Drew heads for Japan where she’s staying at a traditional ryokan (inn) for a little R&R with Bess and George, but when reports of a vengeful ghost start scaring away the guests, Nancy’s vacation takes a turn for terror!

The combat comes in two forms, with gamers using melee attacks and a variety of weapons in physical battles against Jigsaw's thugs, or executing puzzle-based attacks that make use of traps and environmental hazards. Various case files are strewn about the hotels, factories, and sewers in which the game is set, and players can also collect a number of Billy the Puppet dolls hidden throughout each level. As was the case with its predecessor, Saw II: Flesh & Blood includes multiple endings based on choices gamers make throughout the story.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3izx.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Zombie Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":7163,"name":"Rock of the Dead","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Grab your guitar and get your drums!
