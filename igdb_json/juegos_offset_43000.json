Players had to skim surfaces of the planets and destroy all the bunkers therein, as well as beam up fuel cells to maintain their fuel level(s) and avoiding or destroying saucers that would also appear. The game did not do very well commercially and would only be ported to the Atari 2600 a few years later (although it has reappeared on some modern day compilations since). \n \nGravitrex is a clone of Gravitar, although with many differences, such as the addition of humans dotting the planetary landscapes that have to be rescued, and the Gravitrex Plus cart also includes two bonus games and other features as well. All games are for one player only. \n \nGameplay: \n \nThe player controls a fighter ship that begins each game in a solar system. There is a sun in the middle and several planets to choose from to enter so the player can start their mission. If the player takes too long with choosing a planet, a pair of space saucers will emerge from the reactor planet and will engage the player in a dogfight if they get close enough (although the player can just elude them by entering a planet). If the player’s ship gets destroyed or the player shoots both saucers then the player will return to the main solar system screen. \nOnce the player enters a planet by thrusting into it, they must destroy every enemy bunker on the surface and dispose of every fuel tank and human. Humans and fuel tanks can be shot (although the player will not receive any points for doing so), but a bonus is given if all humans are rescued on a level (see Scoring and Extras sections), plus fuel tanks are needed to keep up the player’s fuel level (which is indicated by a line right next to the score at the top left of the screen). Humans and fuel tanks can be teleported into the player’s ship by maneuvering their ship close and activating the teleporter/shields function. Once all bunkers have been destroyed and all humans and fuel tanks have been disposed of, a sound effect will signal that the mission is complete, and upon leaving the planet, it will self-destruct and the player will be given a bonus for that planet. \n \nThe exception to this rule is the lone reactor planet on each level, which has only one target – a reactor – deep inside it. This planet is different than all the others, as the player is given 99 time units to make their way through a brief maze, shoot the reactor, and get out before time runs out or else the player’s ship will be destroyed and the reactor will remain intact. If the player does not destroy this planet last in a level then it clears out the space saucers for the remainder of the level, since this is the planet that they emerge from. \n \nDangers include the player’s ship crashing if it runs out of fuel, plus the ship will be destroyed if shot by a bunker, space saucer or alien air interceptor (which are similar to space saucers but they appear inside a planet), if they crash into a wall, the sun, space saucer or alien air interceptor, or do not leave the reactor planet before their time runs out. If the player runs out of reserve ships then the game will end. The player’s fuel, however, is replenished mostly from a fuel tank and is fully replaced upon destroying a planet, finishing a level, or with each new ship. The player’s teleporter function also doubles as a shield to protect them from enemy fire. Also, if the player defeats all planets in a level, then that level’s sun will go nova, various bonuses are then awarded (see Extras section), and if the player defeats the third level the game will end, giving a congratulations message as well as sharing some trivia about Gravitrex from the game’s programmer John Dondzila on the screen.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":46507,"name":"Vectrace","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Weave your way through the other race cars and toward the checkered flag!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co79gz.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":46508,"name":"Verzerk","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Verzerk is a hack of Berzerk, adding speech this time around, with a robotic voice welcoming the player during the attract mode, then states \"this is Verzerk\".

It quickly sold out of its 100 copies in less than three weeks of release[1], which came with an overlay (a bit rare for Vectrex homebrews in general), were numbered and had an embossed foil logo on its box. It also came with the Spike Goes Down game included with it as well as an unlockable bonus.\n\nThen later on that year, the unlimited edition of Protector was released, although with a different game included, being Y*A*S*I, which stands for \"Yet Another Space Invaders\", as that game was a clone of that arcade classic (hence the title of this release being Protector/Y*A*S*I this time around). Again this was a bit of a surprise within the Vectrex community, as a lot of gamers in general didn't know that the Vectrex is capable of producing raster graphics as well, which Y*A*S*I proved by looking almost exactly like it's arcade cousin, having bitmapped, rather than vector graphics (note: Spike Goes Down also had raster graphics as well, it's just that this unlimited version is more well known, especially since the ROM for Spike Goes Down has yet to be released years later).

The game lacks a clear goal, but is instead nonlinear and emphasizes open exploration, giving players the freedom to explore the city and discover many pathways, buildings, situations, stories and secrets. The game deals with historical, horror, religious and educational themes, and features karma and reincarnation gameplay mechanics. Released on CD-ROM, the dialogues in the game are fully voiced in Japanese, with English subtitles in the localized North American version. The game was not a commercial success, but was critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following.\n\nThe game is set in the medieval city of Kyoto around the year 1000, during the Heian period of Japanese history. The game lacks an overall plot, but it instead presents fragmented narratives in a non-linear manner, as the player character encounters various non-player characters while wandering the city. These narratives are cross-referenced to an encyclopedia, providing background information as the narratives progress and as the player comes across various characters and locations, with various stories and related information appearing at distinct locations.[9]\n\nMany of the characters in the game are based on real-life characters from the city and their appearances in the game are often loosely based on tales from the Konjaku Monogatarishū.

Con ella no podrá usar los demás objetos hasta que la deje en el punto donde la cogió, donde aparecerá un icono con la cara de MAD. \nCoconave: Al entrar en una pista horizontal, se convertirá en una nave espacial que puede moverse a voluntad a izquierda o derecha, y que puede disparar, pero sólo hacia arriba. \nCocotanque: Al entrar en una pista vertical por la parte superior, se convertirá en un tanque que podrá disparar hacia la izquierda o la derecha a voluntad, pero que no puede controlar el movimiento, que se producirá de arriba a abajo automáticamente hasta salir de la pista por la parte inferior. \nTrampillas: Son puertas giratorias que al pasar a través de ellas por el lado abierto, cierran el camino a posibles persecuciones de enemigos al girar y cerrarse por el lado que abandonamos, pero que si las encontramos por el lado cerrado son muros infranqueables que pueden convertirse en una trampa mortal. \nAutococos: Son unos cocos especiales marcados con una flecha que al comerlos nos obligarán a movernos en la dirección que marca la flecha. Suelen estar dispuestos formando caminos predefinidos en los que al entrar nos obliga a recorrer hasta que salgamos del rastro de autococos. Pueden ser mortales si un enemigo se cruza por el camino mientras estamos siguiéndolo.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gat4hig0pwwztwjbav1g.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":46671,"name":"Lord of the Sword","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The followers of the evil Ra Goan have toppled the king from the throne.

The game's platforms are all suspended over a bottomless void. Alice can shoot bubbles, technically termed \"shabon balls\", at the enemy in an effort to knock them off of the floating terrain or destroy them. Holding down the attack button will charge the bubble and make it larger, resulting in greater knockback strength or simply more damage, depending on the enemy.\n\nThe enemies are also trying to knock Alice off, too. In fact, Alice does not take damage in a conventional sense: the only way to lose a life is to fall in to the void. Alice comes equipped with several balloons which can rescue her from a fall should one occur. Alice is capable of jumping to avoid obstacles or shots from enemies, or to jump over gaps in the terrain. At the end of each stage is a boss; Alice has a 180 second time limit to get to the end and defeat the boss or else \"time over\" monsters will appear and attack her.

The red pattern is two lasers in a spiral pattern, while the blue one is one laser straight ahead and one behind, the yellow one is one laser straight ahead, one left, and one right and the green one is two lasers diagonally forward (one to the left and one to the right), and one straight behind; by holding down the button, the ship fires more powerful, spherical lasers.\n\nEven though the game is the sequel to Bosconian (which used a synthesized, DAC-generated voice saying \"Blast off!\" at the beginning of every round), Blast Off had more in common gameplay-wise with Namco's own Dragon Spirit than with Bosconian; this is especially noticeable in the third area of every world, where the player's ship undergoes an increase in size, and must destroy a boss. Despite several gameplay differences, the connection with Bosconian was emphasized in the marketing of the game, with the hexagonal space stations from Bosconian appearing in Namco's press literature, and on the game's title screen, and also making appearances in the game itself - and the game is also worth noting for its usages of various Engrish phrases, such as \"To push start only 1 player button\" (on title screen), \"Go next\" (at end of world), \"Congraturations\" (at end of game) and \"Entry your name\" (on high score table).

The player takes control of a star ship that can transform in to a mecha by obtaining a specific type of power up.\n\nSet in 2013, mankind's first artificial star and planet, \"Le Tau\", is under attack from genetically modified alien monsters. The player must navigate a \"Heavy Unit\", a heavily armed, transforming mecha, in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony.\n\nThe player's ship had two forms: a space-ship and a giant robot. Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. Power Ups are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss. Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread show with the power ups, plus missiles which drops like bombs as auxiliary fire. The robot mode has a frontal laser gun which increases in power with the power ups plus homing missiles as auxiliary fire. An interesting element of the game is represented by the hidden bonuses (usually 1UP) which can be revealed by shooting certain parts of the scenario or by continuously hitting certain indestructible enemies.

According to the manual of the game, tapeworms live in bean patches, love to eat fruit and are preyed upon by other critters named Beeky the Bird, Spanky the Spider and Mystery Beetle. Uhhhh, right.\nOur hero here is Slinky, a tapeworm who's patrolling the local bean patch. In order for him to get to the fruit he loves, he has to slither around the screen eating up all the beans. He consumes them by touching a bean with his head (merely a yellow square), and by doing so, another bean appears somewhere else on the screen, and then you're off again. The more beans Slinky eats, the longer he grows. Which is a problem. As you steer the worm through the bean patch, you need to take great care not to coil him back over himself because, omnivore that he is, Slinky will eat himself.\n\nDon't tread too gingerly because while Slinky is hot after those beans, a beetle is moving across the bottom of the screen, outside the patch, bearing down on something you're supposed to believe is an apple (on later levels, different fruits take the apple's place.) Trust me when I say that it takes a great imagination to believe the block graphics resemble anything you'd find at a farmer's market. Anyway, if the beetle gets to the fruit before Slinky eats his bean, two more beans appear on the screen and Slinky has to eat them, too. Other predators include the Mystery Beetle, Beeky and Spanky. They bleep across the bean patch at random intervals. If they happen to touch Slinky's head, it's curtains for the worm.\n\nTaken as a whole, Tapeworm isn't too bad. It borrows elements from Atari's Surround and Rock-Ola's obscure Nibbler.

As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around. Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level). Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over. If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life. \n \nIf Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air. Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below. However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough. If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion). If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim). As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically. Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again. \n \nPogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile. This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land. As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.  \n \nWhile you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points. The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zn2gajypfpwjfmzivqsp.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"}]},{"id":46908,"name":"Microgammon SB","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Microgammon SB originally started out as an Apple IIe game.

The games were however eventually released by CBS on the Atari 8-bit computers and the Nintendo Entertainment System, although some were slightly retooled.\n\nAs you may have guessed, Astro Grover is an educational game featuring that lovable blue demon Grover. Although the title suggests a game about discovering the solar system, Astro Grover is really about counting and numbers. Atari simply borrowed Grover’s astronaut persona from the reoccurring skits on Sesame Street to make it more interesting. Astro Grover consists of five different mini-games offering up some amusing edutainment that would appropriate for 5-8 year olds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co90r6.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":46913,"name":"Castle Blast","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Castle Blast is shoot'em up based on the 5th screen of Atari's 2600 Phoenix where you take on the mothership. Castle Blast is Ronen Habot's first foray into programming the Atari 5200. Ronen used this experience as a means to write a tutorial on Atari 5200 programming to assist others who might want to write games for the system. \n \nCastle Blast made its debut at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where it was sold with a box, manual and cart. AtariAge held a Castle Blast Label Contest in April, 2002. Castle Blast may be ordered directly from the author, Ronen Habot, by visiting the Castle Blast Development Page. \n \nThe object of this game is to destroy the Castle on the Mothership. You fire Vertical Trajectory Missiles, or VTMs, at the shield on the bottom of the Mothership. When you penetrate the shield, then blast the Castle. To score extra points, you can also shoot the enemy spaceships flying overhead. \n \nIf you destroy the Castle, you advance to the next level, where you will need to contend with Focused Energy Beams, or FEBs, fired from the Mothership. There will also be stars appearing in the sky, making it harder to target the spaceships. \n \nIf you manage to obliterate the Castle again, you will proceed to the next level, which adds ground-based tanks assaulting you. You have Horizontal Trajectory Missiles, or HTMs, to deal with this new enemy but do not lose sight of your primary goal. \n \nYour joystick moves you left or right. The lower button fires VTMs, the upper button fires HTMs.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sjbvhdubb0em0hoanq3h.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"}]},{"id":46914,"name":"John Anderson's Rally Speedway","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A top-down car racing game written by John Anderson in which the players can drive either through two provided courses or construct their own ones with the offered track editor.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mhrr7mkhadaqjxssclja.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":46915,"name":"Pacific Coast Hwy","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xg49su7g4ekgkjuzg9ad.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":46916,"name":"Yellow Submarine","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Yellow Submarine was a prototype coded by an unknown Atari programmer to demonstrate directional control and the ability to move off one side of the screen and reappear on the opposite side.
