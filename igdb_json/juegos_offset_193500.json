Ancient and beautiful, powerful and wise they ruled absolute. Strange beings, magical creatures and humans lived together in peace and harmony, until greed destroyed it all. Ismael, a respected man, and revered by all, sadly had a heart that was hollow and bitter. He and four others plotted to overthrow the Mecubarz.\n\nThe Mecubarz' fury at the treason of Ismael and his men was cataclysmic. They trapped the four seasons and put them into impenetrable crystals, casting them to the four corners of the shattered world where they stood still and were held in an eternal dominion of ice, mist, water, and fire. The four traitors were exiled, but Ismael disappeared.\n\nAs Quickthorpe, an inexperienced adventurer, your quest is to explore the Four Lands of the Mecubarz in search of the mystical gems that will liberate your people. Keen observation, puzzle-solving skill and quick thinking are the abilities required to undertake this exciting but unpredictable task. Interact with a universe of characters which come to life with true speech creating a world with an atmosphere so thick you can feel it.

Not only will it be harder to drive to the basket, gamers have a greater chance of getting fouled-out, with increased foul elements such as offensive fouls and basket-count.

It is an original story, although the amusement park theme is constantly revisited in the franchise, especially in anime and game form. The protagonist is Conan Edogawa, the alter ego of Shinichi Kudō, a high school detective who was transformed unwillingly into a kid. Chika Yūenchi Satsujin Jiken itself is an adventure game where the task is to solve murder cases. The player controls Conan from a top-down perspective and can move around freely in the park, seeking for clues or engaging other characters in conversation. Sometimes it's possible to choose what to ask a character, but that has no outcome on how the case proceeds. The investigation is moved forward by talking to the right people, finding the necessary clues, solving puzzles and by \"thinking\". The latter is an actual gameplay mechanic where Conan analyses certain events that he finds suspicious. It ends with the player selecting one out of two deductions. If the incorrect answer was chosen, the accusation will not hold and the murderer will get away. Furthermore, it's possible to officially accuse a suspect with insufficient proof and without finishing the entire scenario, even if this results in arresting the wrong person or ending the game prematurely.\n\nThe game has three different murder cases, each corresponding to one of the attractions in the amusement park: the roller coaster, the horror house and the huge maze. The first attraction Conan enters after being greeted by Nobuhara and the staff decides which scenario the player will play. In order to switch to another murder case, the game must be started over. The only way to resume a previous session is via passwords the game gives at specific points during the scenario.\n\nA standard feature adopted by later installments is the presence of mini games. Two of them (a claw crane and a skateboarding game) can be played at any time in the Game Center, while others must be found or unlocked.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co52m9.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":64306,"name":"Tetris S","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Japan-only release of Tetris for the Saturn.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6q7r.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":64084,"name":"Terra Phantastica","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Sega Saturn SRPG featuring a female protagonist who must fulfill her duty of raising a young prince while simultaneously protecting her Kingdom from forces of evil.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4oxq.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":46092,"name":"Fire Pro Wrestling S: 6 Men Scramble","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fire Pro Wrestling S: 6 Men Scramble is an entry in Human's Fire Pro Wrestling series of wrestling games released for the Sega Saturn in 1996 exclusively in Japan.

You take on the role of Dark Schneider, an evil wizard who parts on a quest to regain back his memory. The gameplay isn’t really deep, you just go from one boss to another. You have tons of magic moves to use in battle and you can even combine them to create devastating spells. One major disadvantage is that the game was only aimed at the readers of the manga, so if you haven’t read the manga, you won’t understand anything of the characters and the background story.\n\nBastard? Destructive God of Darkness is a manga by Kazushi Hagiwara. It first appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump, in 1988, and continues to be published irregularly today in Ultra Jump. Currently, it spans 25 volumes.\n\nIn Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren.\n\nBastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers.\n\nIn the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world.\n\nThe story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society. The episodes are rather disjointed, with scenes missing in between episodes making it hard to follow, but taken at face value it makes enough sense.\n\nManufacturer's description:\n\nHagiwara Hazime solstitial popular comic \"BASTARD!!\" based on an original story developed in RPG.

Not only the open ended rings from VF are present (but now, with no ring-out), but also the closed cages from Fighting Vipers. VF characters have new moves taken from VF3, but the most impressive feature was the dodge move, which allowed characters to sidestep, avoiding a dangerous blow and opening at the same time room for a counter. Sega capitalized on this, calling Fighters Megamix the first \"real 3D\" fighting game in the market.\nUnlike most of AM2's games of the era, Fighters Megamix did not have an arcade release.

The interactive FMV component uses gameplay identical to an earlier Warp game, D.\n\nThe real time component of E0 is unique. Enemies are invisible, and location is only possible through the use of sound, with notes of different pitch helping the player find the distance and direction of enemies. Additionally, every gun in the game must be charged up immediately before each shot, and charging a shot for too long will cause the charge to dissipate, after which the charging must start over. Since all available guns have very limited range, this makes timing crucial; beginning to charge the gun too late or too soon will allow the enemy to reach Laura, resulting in an immediate game over.\n\nIn Enemy Zero, reloading the gun and moving the character around are mechanics that have been made intentionally slow,[4] which stimulates players to avoid combat and direct contact with the alien enemies as much as possible. In the early segments of the game, avoiding detection is not only recommended; it is required, since the player has no means to defend him or herself without a gun. Enemy Zero is an example of a game containing stealth elements[5] roughly two years before the release of Metal Gear Solid popularized the genre worldwide, though ten years after Metal Gear started the genre in 1987.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g3b.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":51379,"name":"Hyperblade","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"HyperBlade introduces the 3D battlesport of the future.

Each visit is in two parts, for example visiting Granny in the frozen north starts with a request to click on all the items beginning with a specific letter to defrost them. There's usually around half a dozen items on the ground of which four match the specified criteria. Once this task has been completed the pupil goes to an ice hockey practice session. Here a letter is shown on the scoreboard and hockey pucks with three and four letter words are slid over the ice. If the initial letter of the word matches the target letter the pupil clicks on the puck and, if they're right, it's fired into the net. If the initial letter does not match the target letter they click on the referee and the puck melts away.
