The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to some sort of puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas that are otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6as3.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tec Toy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SEGA AM7","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Game Gear"}]},{"id":242817,"name":"Darkfate","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Darkfate is an exploration platformer that follows Chris Freeman, a man whose memory has failed him.
