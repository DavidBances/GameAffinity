The seeds were flung outward, toward the edge of the galaxy, beyond where Atlas’s power had ever reached. The seeds drifted for endless centuries. One by one, they were lost in the vast darkness between the stars. Only a single seed survived. Weakened and dying, Atlas’s instincts drove it toward the nearest suitable planet. This was Arctora, and it was not like anything the seed could have imagined. \n \nArctora was a world of metal and silver seas. Vast swathes of its surface had been sheared of all organic material, all an effort by a powerful artificial intelligence known as the Librarian to convert the planet into a single computer. Organic life had long become almost extinct, replaced by cybernetic servants to the Librarian. When Atlas’s seed landed and released its power, Arctora was changed forever. \n \nAtlas’s seed landed and its power surged through the land. With so little organic matter to work with, the power used what it had. Millions of new life forms, some organic, some cybernetic — but most of them a combination of both — were born instantly. Four essences, or Guardians, greater than the others, emerged from the seed. Calling themselves Gorok, Ometa, Apophis, and Hamaliel, they were created for the single purpose of guarding Atlas’s seed until it could regrow. Heroes, each sworn to one of the four guardians, flocked to the continent. There were no rules, no boundaries, no laws. The new land was full of dangers and demanded alliances - but alliances on Arctora are ephemeral things. Each Guardian was determined to be the one to find the energy source and regrow Atlas… and to take its power for itself.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2q9z.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":33716,"name":"Formicide","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Online ant warfare just got classier. \n \nFormicide is a fast-paced 2D online platformer featuring a lineup of versatile classes.

Start building your transport empire by creating bus routes between as many cites as possible. You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic.\n\nThe player's company is responsible for connecting service centers to gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\n\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your buses, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks.\n\nKey game features:\n- transport passengers between bus stations\n- a variety of bus models\n- build roads, stations, traffic lights completely free\n- upgrade stations to large bus hubs\n- upgrade gas station to offer different fuel types\n- beautiful night and day graphics, automatic or manual settings\n- build road network freely\n- build traffic lights to each junction\n- automatic breakdown generation\n- automatic road crack generation\n- various demolishing tools\n\nThe developer's notes:\nIf you liked the game, please provide us with feedback or a review and rate the game.
