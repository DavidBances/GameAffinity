Midgard Outlaw uses the same weapons and enemies from Project Einherjar, but adds several new foes, as well as a dynamic music gimmick: the soundtrack is comprised of ogg vorbis instead of midi, and switches from calm to intense at certain points during each mission. Unlike its sci-fi heavy predecessor, Midgard Outlaw has almost no sci-fi elements apart from the dystopian setting, focusing on an action movie motif instead.

There are two new ways to make enemies in a grapple suffer, elbow smashes to the head, and a high kick to propel them away. In the brief time window when the Lee brothers are crouching after a jump or after getting knocked down, it’s possible to perform a rising uppercut or a knee jump attack. The timing for these isn’t easy, but they are the most powerful moves in the game.\n\nOn the NES, Double Dragon II is a much more innovative and unique sequel than in the arcade, but it marks also the time Double Dragon started its schizophrenic shifting between wildly different tones and gameplay styles. In a way it’s one of the best games to bear the Double Dragon name, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that Technōs had already started to loose a cohesive vision of what it meant to be Double Dragon, both in tone and in gameplay.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4wy0.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Technos Japan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Million","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arc System Works","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":201322,"name":"Double Dragon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Double Dragon: The Revenge of Billy Lee is a beat 'em up game developed and published by Virgin Interactive in 1993 for Sega's Game Gear handheld console.
