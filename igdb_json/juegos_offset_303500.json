Further details surrounding the cancellation and the game's fate in their entirety remain unclear to this day, as no official announcement regarding its status has been made by either Sega or Edge of Reality, however, more recently, a U.S. federal trademark registration was filed on September 11, 2009, which as of October 19, 2011, has been granted a third extension. While confirming nothing else, this does indicate that Edge of Reality has retained the intellectual property rights to the game.\n\nAlthough the game was widely believed to be permanently cancelled by Sega, game designer Phil Fogerite (who worked as level designer on the project from March 2008 to April 2009) has most recently stated that Edge of Reality itself had in fact decided to put the game on indefinite hold.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/siwtwgdczl52swdod5pt.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":25215,"name":"Diox","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Diox is a first and third person RPG shooter set in the near future.

Game is currently in early development with set goals.\n\n* PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD - You will play a robot as the main protagonist of Floatlands, going up against other robots. Game world will consist of several biomes: jungle, desert, sea and snow. These worlds will be unique all the time because they will be randomly generated. Islands and natural elements will have certain similarities, but altogether the world will be unique every time.\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scorched-sunset-lowpoly-floatlands.png\n\n* QUESTING, POINTS OF INTEREST - There will be random events/quests (defending, collecting, exploring) across the world for you to complete. Quests, missions will also be randomly generated in order to bring the unpredictability aspect to the game.\n\nhttps://i0.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/quest-character-lowpoly-floatlands-2.png\n\n* PLAYING STYLES - You can choose different play styles when playing in the world of Floatlands. You can be an explorer or you can be an aggressive player that wants to eliminate threats of well being.\n\n* RESOURCE GATHERING - Important part will be the resource gathering aspect. Some basics: Shooting down robot enemies will provide you scrap metal; by chopping trees you will gain wood; sheep is a source for wool; you will also find resources in caves. Certain materials need to be processed and smelted in order to be used for building structures.\n\n* CUSTOM BUILD MODE - With gathered resources you’ll be able to build and upgrade your own custom base/shelter and defend from enemies. At this moment there are 50 different build parts you can use to build your base. There are also 3 tiers – wood (starting tier), stone and fortified stone (highest tier for now). Build mode mixed with random generated terrain provides a multitude of options (basic shacks, castles…), so it will be interesting in this regard.\n\n* ELECTRIC SYSTEM - One other major feature in game is electricity which will provide you with different options in the game - repairing your robot, powering up the lights and your defense system (turrets). We are in the process of making various props that will need a source of energy. Generators will be that source and with cables you'll have the option to connect devices yourself. You will have to fill generators with fuel to get them to work.\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/electricity_connection_lowpoly_floatlands.png","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ouaxx1g0bmqrfg6lcfyo.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":25201,"name":"Grav|Lab","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":25123,"name":"Nightmare: The Elemental Curse","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Although this game is in development, I don't think right now is the appropriate time to mention the creation of the game until the trailer is done and more content is available. \n \nIf you want to find information, keep an eye out on gamejolt. \n \nGoodbye and see you all soon \n- Jesus Barajas (Lead....well.....Everything)","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jxfwrgtleqqopwm2hley.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":25122,"name":"Knight Light","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Knight Light is a fast-paced, competitive arcade game where you and your friends battle for the most points in colorful virtual arenas.
