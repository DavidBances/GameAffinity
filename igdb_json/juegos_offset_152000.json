Can you help him escape the lab?\n\nAlongside the traditional platform elements such as jumping on enemies heads, spikes and moving platforms are the gateway guns. The gateway guns allow you to place two gateways on the walls, floors and ceilings of the lab so that when you pass through one you emerge out of the other. As progress is made through the game different types of gateway gun are introduced with different effects. After the basic gun, you acquire a gun that creates two gateways of different sizes, passing through one way shrinks Ed to half his size and the other way makes Ed grow to twice his size. Then you find a gun where one gateway doesn't just connect to the others location but also its time, allowing Ed to travel back in time and encounter earlier versions of himself. Finally, the last gun manipulates gravity so passing through allows Ed to walk along walls and on ceilings.\n\nGateways takes place on a single sprawling map rammed with puzzles and challenges. As power ups are acquired more and more of the map opens up containing more power ups and secrets. In addition to the gateway guns Ed will also find a torch letting him light up the darker areas of the map and a mirror which can be used to deflect lasers.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25cn.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Smudged Cat Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":8261,"name":"Fractured Soul","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fractured Soul takes the classic platformers of the 80s and doubles the action!

While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.\n\nThe main focus in CoE3 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.\n\nIn each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired \"location\" it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.Key Features:\n\n18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have\nCopious amounts of monsters and random events, good and bad\nRandom maps.\nSpell system with 42 magic paths\nNetwork or hotseat multiplayer\nTeam play, you can be 2 players against the AI for example.\nStealth and invisibility. Scouts needed to detect stealthy troops, something better (a star spawn or a beast bat will work) needed to detect the invisible ones.\nAssassins that make an assassination attack before combat starts.\nCatapults, Hill Giants and Rocs that can throw or drop boulders during sieges.\nImmortal Liches and Vampires.\nRegenerating trolls rise from the dead if they haven't been killed too badly or their side lost.\nLarge worms that can swallow smaller enemies whole. Swallowed units take a few points of damage from digestion each round until they are freed.\nShape changers that looks like something else when seen by the enemies.\nAnd many many more monsters and abilites....","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3nih.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Illwinter Game Design","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":271730,"name":"Tormentarium","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Large metal-style industrial facility surrounded by caverns; features a few custom map props.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co78a0.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":167125,"name":"Anamorphosis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Anamorphosis is a traditional Yume Nikki fangame.

An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future, becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.\n\nThe game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities.\n\nOriginal author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.\n\nThe title was Delisted from PSN and Xbox Live on September 11, 2014.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co55w1.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CyberConnect2","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Capcom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":31319,"name":"World End Economica: Episode.03","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The conclusive episode in this visual novel trilogy is set in the far future on the moon.
