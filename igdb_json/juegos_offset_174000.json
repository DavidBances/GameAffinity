The bosses included in this game come from the games Embodiment of Scarlet Devil to Phantasmagoria of Flower View.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2a6f.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mediascape","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team Shanghai Alice","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":70521,"name":"Wizardry Asterisk: Hiiro no Fuuin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A DS remake of the first Wizardry.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9fh1.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Starfish SD","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":67951,"name":"Ragnarok Battle Offline: Extra Scenario 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second expansion pack for the 2D brawler Ragnarok Battle Offline.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fqm8j5jvk63rwdtz94mv.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":59388,"name":"Comic Party Portable","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Comic Party Portable is a non-adult port of Comic Party, an adult visual novel for PC (Windows).

Flyff is a fairly typical party-oriented grinding game where no character can do everything; efficient play requires working in groups to level up by killing monsters, or Masquerpets. Its main distinctiveness lies in its flying system: flying is the normal method of transportation for characters above level 20.\n\nFlyff is hosted in 13 countries and 10 languages and is played by over 30 million people.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nPlayers control an avatar that spends most of its active time fighting and most of its inactive time running a shop. Character classes are chosen at level 15 and sub-classes at levels 60 and 130, referred to as the first, second, and third job changes. The job changes are obligatory—when a character reaches the requisite level, experience gain stops until the completion of one of the job quests. At level 120, the character can become a Master, returning to level 60 with enhanced powers and able to work its way back up to level 121 and become a Hero. As of version 17, Heroes may select a third job class at level 130 and level up to the current cap of 150.\n\nLevels are gained based on experience, which can be acquired by killing Masquerpets and by performing quests. Quests generally involve killing specific Masquerpets and collecting the different quest objects they drop; a typical early quest is that of \"Party of Is,\" with the requirement of collecting 7 Chupims through killing Pukepukes.\n\nAt each level, the character receives skill points that can be invested in skills available to its job(s). There are two types of skills: those used for attacking and those used for protection and/or enhancement. Skills may have cool-down times and may cause status effects, with confusion, stun, and bleed among the most common effect. It is not possible to acquire maximum levels in all available skills until becoming a level 60 Master.\n\nCharacters can be improved by acquiring objects such as improved equipment. Masquerpets drop equipment, the in-game currency penya, consumable items such as food and potions, and quest objects, or players can purchase equipment from other players note this is usually extremely expensive because of the high quality gear that can be acquired this way. These can all be traded between players; Flyff gameplay involves large amounts of buying and selling in order to collect desired equipment. Most equipment items have minimum levels at which they can be used.\n\nCombat\nFlyff features melee, ranged and magic combat, with different skills available to different classes. Health points, fight points, and magic power bars are able to be replenished through food, vital drinks and mana refreshers; some classes depend on assists to heal them with magic.\n\nPvP\nPlayer versus player (PvP) combat is allowed on all servers without penalty in the form of dueling. Both players must be over level 15, and within 30 levels of each other, then they must confirm the duel first unless they are within the PvP Arena, a free-for-all environment found on all servers. Player killing is allowed only on the Yetti server and carries a high penalty.\n\nSOCIAL SYSTEMS:\nLord System\nIntroduced in version 12, the Lord system allows eligible players to be voted as the Lord of their server for 2 weeks. Players must have obtained Hero or Master status to qualify as a Lord candidate. While a Lord, a player may introduce a number of events on the server. Lords are taxed between 0 to 20% on all NPC purchases and returns and are given a portion of all player taxes. 10% of eligible voters must participate in the Lord vote for a Lord to be chosen. To vote for a candidate, a player must be at least level 60 and must have logged in to the game within the last 30 days. Each player may only vote for one candidate per election.\n\nParty System\nPlayers who join a party gain increased experience and loot. A lone player does not benefit from or harm a party. A party starts as a Regular Party, in which experience is distributed evenly among party members in the same location. At level 10, the party becomes Advanced, at which point experience can be distributed to players based on their amount of damage done. An Advanced Party may have up to 8 players; having this many players in a party increases player experience with each monster killed during training.\n\nGuild System\nGuilds allow players to socialize; players within a guild can chat with each other and many in-game activities are guild-based. Guilds have a hierarchical chain of command, consisting of the Master/Leader, Kingpins, Captains, Supporters, and Rookies. The guild master may change the permissions for guild members, allowing members to withdraw items or money from the guild bank, rank-up or de-rank other members, and be paid daily. Guilds are able to choose an emblem and cloak to represent themselves and have the use of a warehouse. When a guild reaches the appropriate guild level, increased by supporting the guild through quest items and Penya, the guild master may create guild cloaks at a cost that sport the guild's symbol. A large amount of Flyff end-game content is guild-related.\n\nGuild Siege\nThis event, held on Saturday in channel 1 of each server, allows guilds to compete in a free-for-all environment. A total of 8 Guilds may enter, and each Guild may have 10 players. To compete, the Guild leader must place a bid; the 8 highest bidders compete.\n\nClockworks War\nThe Clockworks War is a guild dungeon that guilds of any level may enter a single time. If the guild fails against the dungeon boss, its players may reattempt to win as many times as necessary for a time period of one hour. Only one guild is permitted inside the Clockworks Arena at a time.\n\nCouple System\nThe couple system, implemented in Version 13, allows a marriage-style connection between two characters. Characters who become a couple are granted special buffs and skills and receive gifts with new couple level gained.\n\nMentor/Pupil System\nThe Mentor/Pupil system, implemented in Version 15, allows any player level 91 or above to take on any character who has not completed their second Job Change as a pupil after completing the mentor qualification quest. This Mentor/Pupil bond provides a special bonus to experience gained by both mentor and pupil while both characters are logged on to the same server. Additionally, upon the pupil reaching certain level marks, the mentor gains 'Mentor Points'; as the mentor gains more of these points, additional pupils may be taken on, to a maximum of 3 pupils when over 100 Mentor Points are gained. These additional pupils grant increases to the experience bonus of the mentor; the other pupils' experience bonus' remain unchanged.\n\nWhile no action apart from the initial bonding is necessary within the Mentor/Pupil relationship, mentors are encouraged to help their pupils with advice, quests, and/or occasional gifts. If at any time either pupil or mentor becomes dissatisfied, the player may cancel the bond. The Mentor Points of a mentor who loses all pupils returns to 0 and must be regained through new Mentor/Pupil bonds.\n\nOTHER GAME SYSTEMS:\nEvents\nEvents involving rare drops and extra experience are held almost every week by the gamemaster team. Maintenance is held every Tuesday evening (gPotato) and Thursday noon (FlyFF PH).\n\nCollector System\nRe-Introduced in version 11, the Collector System allows players to collect rare and unique game items through the use of a Collectors.\n\nPrivate Shops\nPlayers can open private shops, in which held items can be sold at any price. Other players can enter these shops and purchase the items within, with the purchase money transferred to the shop owner's inventory.\n\nRaising Pets\nPlayers may keep seven types of Raised Pets, which start out as eggs that may be dropped by any Masquerpet level 20 and above. An egg can be hatched by the Pet Tamer NPC after feeding the egg 50,000 pet feed. To evolve a pet, players must complete quests given by the Pet Tamer. Pets must also be fed to keep them alive. Each Raised Pet has five levels and three appearances. A player accompanied by a pet receives additional stat points based on the type of pet.\n\nElements\nMonsters are generally associated with a particular in-game elements, of which there are five. Each element is vulnerable to one element and resistant to another. Weapons and armor can be \"elemented\", conferring advantages against monsters of some types and disadvantages against others; many aggressive spells are also elemented.\n\nCash Shop\nFlyff uses a micropayment system through which users can obtain 'Game Cash'. Game Cash can be exchanged for premium items not otherwise available in the game, including clothing, potions, different kinds of scrolls and pick-up pets.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nIn December 2002, Aeonsoft developed the first provisional prototype of the game, called Clockworks Ltd. In September 2003, the company changed the game's name to Flyff, and began its first closed beta in Korea. In July 2004, it won the Game of the Month award from the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Over the next year, it was launched in three more countries: China, Taiwan, and Thailand. In October 2005, the US received the closed beta, which ran for a month before Flyff was commercially launched in December.\n\nTECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT:\nGame mechanics\nAeonsoft employs its own in-house core technology. The world object engine uses load balancing middle-ware, multi-thread and parallel game logic processing. The 3D flying engine uses faster process with vector and collide mesh and 3D space divided by Octree System. Its network sync engine utilities packet optimization by object move estimation, client-side sync calculation, and object move calibration processes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3xug.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gala Lab Corp.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Aeonsoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":322345,"name":"Elfo: Rescue Craby","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co91sp.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":311662,"name":"A Knight's Pursuit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8m08.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":316828,"name":"The Bonte Room","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You find yourself dropped in a strange room, but are you smart enough to get out?","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8th8.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bart Bonte","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":221283,"name":"Gyakuten Saiban","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A straight port of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney released in Japan as an episodical game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5tsf.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Capcom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":71801,"name":"Elf Bowling 6: Air Biscuits","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Elf Bowling 6: Air Biscuits involved bowling the elf over a mound of snow which sends the elf airborne.

Another feature unique to this, and the Nintendo DS, version are \"Secrets\" which the player can find scattered around Strangetown or by socialising with characters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8g19.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Amaze Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Maxis","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":71333,"name":"Granny in Paradise","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Granny in Paradise is the second game in the Super Granny series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/uvoq1xx4vrbtut6fljbk.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sandlot Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":243028,"name":"Asphalt: Urban GT 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6b5c.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gameloft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Virtuos","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"N-Gage"}]},{"id":239902,"name":"Super Mario Bros. 3: The Lost Levels","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Mario Bros. 3: The Lost Levels is a rom hack that implements all of the unused levels in Super Mario Bros. 3 into the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67ht.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Megabyte","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The Mushroom Kingdom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":210300,"name":"Sonic the Hedgehog","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sonic the Hedgehog is a mobile phone game released for i-mode 90x and EZweb (BREW 3.1) devices through the Sonic Cafe portal.

The player takes the role of a Soviet commando on an undercover mission to meet a contact in Allied-occupied Germany. However, things go badly for this meeting, leaving the protagonist without proper support, equipment, and identification papers. Behind Allied-occupied lines, the player must attempt to stop a rogue third party intent on initiating World War III between the US and Russia.\n\nPlayers can choose to start with one of 6 player classes: Soldier, Grenadier, Scout, Sniper, Medic, and Engineer. Additionally, there are opportunities throughout the game to recruit additional characters to round out the party's abilities. The game itself features a branching plot where the player's actions and dealings with NPC's can have serious consequences later on. For example, an intelligent character may be able to talk his way out of a situation, and killing Allied soldiers may prompt more patrols later on and slide the situation towards World War III.\n\nHammer & Sickle also features heavy squad-based combat, and it inherits the turn-based engine from Silent Storm. Players spend Action Points to perform various actions in battle each turn, while the enemy does the same. The engine also models realistic looking physics that feature ragdoll animations, bullet ricochet, and destructible environments. As for available equipment, there are 90 weapons and variants that can be found or bought.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2x88.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":4014,"name":"Momotaro Dentetsu 11: Black Bombee Shutsugen! no Maki","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6txh.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}]},{"id":315201,"name":"Five Lethal Demons","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Five Lethal Demons is a free 2D point-and-click adventure.

Each coach has a number of different attributes, and these attributes will determine many different aspects of the game. Charisma, for example, affects recruitment and player confidence, while discipline will help players focus on the game. Players may also bring issues to the coach to solve, which also affects the team's playing ability as well. Gamers will also have access to the coach's clipboard during the game. The clipboard will pop up automatically when gamers need to make adjustments instead of requiring gamers to access a series of menus. Another new feature are the four points of emphasis: ball control, defense, rebounding, and shot selection. Selecting one will boast the team's particular effectiveness in that area proportionate to the coach's attributes. Recruiting, likewise, has been upgraded and tweaked. Gamers can track 15 potential recruits during the season, watching their interest levels and stats and have the option of controlling the recruiting themselves or allowing the assistant coaches to deal many of the decisions. COLLEGE HOOPS 2K6 perfectly captures all of the aspects of coaching a NCAA team but, with assistant coaches and other options, never makes the gamer feel overwhelmed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4b2g.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Concepts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Sports","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"}]},{"id":273552,"name":"Temple of Lust","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A map designed for Torn's Doom Advent Calendar 2005 day 3","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":2819,"name":"Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi: Kaznapped!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Help Ami and Yumi track down their annoying Number One Fan, Harmony, recover their instruments and rescue their manager, Kaz.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ap4.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"D3 Publisher","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Altron","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":2577,"name":"Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Supersonic Warriors 2 is the DS sequel to the GBA fighting game Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors, based on Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball series.\n\nThe game features one-on-one battles between over 30 characters with their own movement and combos.

In Pennant Fever mode players will get to play through the final games of the season from the basic franchise mode. Thus giving them the chance to only play through the excitement and frantic play that often encapsulates the last few games of the season. The Championship Moments mode, on the other hand is a little different in that it lets fans play through some of the greatest World Series moments throughout history in a type of simulation. This allows players to get directly on the inside of some of the games that changed the way America viewed baseball.
