The game's development is guided by our 'C.F.R.F' principle: 'Competitive First, Realism Follows,' which prioritizes competitive elements in gameplay decisions and design.\n\nMoE is designed to be accessible and engaging, avoiding the complex hero abilities or arcade-style power-ups that have infiltrated the genre, and instead emphasizing realistic Special Forces or Counter-Terrorist scenarios that enforce, or dare we say, demand genuine skill. Drawing inspiration from foundational titles like the SWAT and the Rainbow 6 series, as well as classics like Counter-Strike and contemporary games like Escape from Tarkov and Rainbow Six Siege, \"Method of Entry\" taps into a deep well of tactical shooter heritage.\n\nThis project is a response to the competitive community's desire for a streamlined, 5v5 tactical shooter where competitive elements take precedence. Realism is then seamlessly integrated, with attention to weapon dynamics, player movement, environmental design, hit detection, and overall intensity. However, this integration never overshadows MoE’s core competitive mechanics, ensuring a balanced and stable competitive experience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9bj0.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Attack Dog Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":329370,"name":"Donkey Konga 1+2 Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9bj1.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}]},{"id":329371,"name":"Cubic Odyssey","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Embark on a galactic journey in Cubic Odyssey, an open-world adventure where you explore vibrant planets, craft tools, build vehicles, and fight the Red Darkness.

The games cover a wide range of subjects. In one game, for example, kids will learn new words, arrange them in sentences, and see them performed by eccentric bug actors. In another, they will practice elementary math skills and identify coins to outwit pirates. They will learn about the animal kingdom and watch over ninety animals animate as they are placed in different natural backgrounds. Afterwards, kids can show off their natural science knowledge in a fun game show, WhatUs My Animal!\n\nIn addition to mini-games, The Treehouse also features many activity centers that are there just for fun. In the Music Studio, kids can explore their musical talents as they compose songs using a variety of instruments and styles. In the theatre, they can create a play by mixing and matching a range of characters, objects, and scenery, as well as write their own movie script.\n\nWith a staggering range of activities, games, and cute animations, The Treehouse will keep preschoolers enthralled for hours on end without realizing that they're learning useful skills along the way. It is no wonder that the program went on to become one of the best selling programs from Brøderbund, and went on to inspire many sequels and CD-ROM remakes.
