We're talking about a level-based runner inspired by the Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show. That's right, this 2018 comedy revisits the all-time classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT or The Ninja Turtles).\n\nYou get to go on an adventure alongside Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, and Michaelangelo through 50 different missions in which you have to collect coins in order to stop the New York mutants from gaining control over the city. The game is very similar to other classic games such as Subway Surfers or Temple Run as far as the gameplay goes: your character moves horizontally through different lanes by sliding your finger across the screen. You can also jump and slide under objects by swiping up or down.\n\nEach Ninja Turtle includes its own unique attacks, which you can perform by tapping on the screen. There's even a way to customize them more by using these three elements: costumes, weapons, and skills. Earn these unlockables by advancing through the different levels, or by playing with a roulette (but it'll cost a pretty significant amount of coins). With your earnings, you can also level up your characters.\n\nRise of the TMNT: Ninja Run is an incredible videogame that combines endless runners and New York's Ninja Turtles. Shout Cowabunga at the top of your lungs and submerge yourself in a comics universe with the game's eye-catching style.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yj7.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nickelodeon","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":144970,"name":"Oh My Pool!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Oh My Pool‪! is very simple and fun game for the whole family.

Playable from start to finish as of 2020, the hack boasts 43 total chapters, 62 playable characters, and various unique mechanics that help to set it apart from the game it deviates from.\n\nOn the continent of Yaska lies six distinct nations, including the empire of Nevan, led by Emperor Festan. The imperial state of Belaro, led by Lord Gradin, has resorted to heavily taxing its citizens, jailing those who cannot comply. Needless to say, this proves unpopular with the state's population, including Storch, a young farmer, and his friends and family. Soon, he's resorting to stealing from the rich to be able to help his family avoid prison. One excursion into a relatively wealthy part of Belaro ultimately leads him down a path that would change the course of Nevan's history.\n\nDesigned to be played as an ironman run, hence the large cast, Vision Quest boasts an incredible amount of content and a tone that slides carefully between drama and humor with its character interactions and small scale compared to most Fire Emblem games (more in line with Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 than anything else). The game is divided into four parts, similar to Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, with each progressively growing in scale without ever resorting to having you fight dragons or gods. The patch can be found at the link provided.
