Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round.

Instead the setting this time is Syria in the near future.\n\nAs with previous games in the series the focus lies on tactical ground combat battles. Each battle starts with a mission briefing where the player gets to study the strategic and operational maps and gets a description of the mission. After this the player is moved to the 3D battlefield and the Setup Phase where the action is paused. Here the battlefield has setup zones where the player can position his units. The player can here issue commands to his units, which will be activated once the battle begins. When happy with this the player can choose to start the actual battle.\n\nThe game features a number of gameplay styles. In it's most basic form the game is played in simultaneous time, meaning that a second of play time equals a second of real time. Players can however choose to change this to an alternative playing style. In the real-time mode the battles starts after the setup has been completed and only stops if the player chooses to pause the action. In the turn-based mode, each turn of the battle (except for the first) has three phases. It starts with an command phase where the player issues orders. After this comes the action phase where the units execute their orders. This consists of 60 seconds of real-time action. Last is the replay phase where the player can rewind and replay the action. For the first turn of the battle, the action phase is based on the commands given in the setup phase. The player is not able to issue any more commands in the action and replay phases.\n\nEach battle can have a number of different victory conditions based on different objectives. Three main types of objectives exist: terrain-based, unit-based and force-wide objectives. Terrain-based objectives include occupying an area, destroying a building, defend an area or reaching an area. Unit-based objectives can be tied both to single units or to a group of units and include destroying or spotting specific units. Force-wide objectives include the number of casualties, condition of troops and amount of ammo left.\n\nCombat Mission: Shock Force contains two campaign played from the US side: Yakima Training Center and Task Force Thunder. Yakima Training Center is a training mode for new players that teaches the game mechanics. In the Task Force Thunder campaign players take command of a battalion-sized combined arms Task Force across the Syrian border with the goal of splitting the country in two. Combat Mission campaigns are semi-dynamic which means that they consist of both predetermined elements, as well as some that are based on the actions of the player. Each battle's starting conditions depend on the result of the previous battle.\n\nThe game also has QuickBattles, which is battles where the units and the map are randomly generated depending on what parameters are set by the player. Options include environment, size and weather as well as unit types and quality.\n\nThe game supports two player multiplayer. The real-time mode can be played through LAN or Internet, while the turn-based mode can be played in hotseat (two players on the same computer) or through E-mail.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fsx.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":21235,"name":"Soul Nomad & the World Eaters","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gig and the gang are back to spread destruction!

Within lurks an evil unknown to man that bears a danger so much greater than any threat yet witnessed. A dark, mysterious power has manifested itself in the depths of the gas giant, absorbing life and technology, and assimilating all in its wake. Spacecraft, pilots, androids, and computers: Nothing is safe. No one can escape the virus that infects all life forms, turning once brave heroes and peaceful colonists alike into ravaging, chaotic forces, fighting each other and infecting more in the process. Soulless technology and hate-driven humanoids are all that's left of Earth's once-proud fleet. The galaxy as we know it is threatening to fall apart. War, death, and bedlam have taken hold of civilisation. Humankind is at the brink of extinction. Those who aren't yet infected--the resistance, a band of mercenaries, soldiers and civilians--are Earth's final hope, and they have one goal in common: To stop the deadly infection and destroy the core of all evil, hidden in the depths of Conceyta. Scouts have undertaken a merciless mission to bring detailed plans and data on the location of the power and its defence line in a last attempt to save humankind. So it has come to be that the last remaining pilot, a mercenary and bounty hunter, is the only chance of survival, ironically driven by the desire for wealth and fame. Left with little choice, the resistance has developed a star fighter capable of intercepting the evil force, equipped with a deadly weapon system and of utmost agility. With no time to lose, the 10th and final prototype of the ship is handed to the pilot. Its name: \"Sldner-X\". Should the pilot succeed, his name shall live on in the memories of man forever to come.
