The challenger is a stout man in brown skin. The ground has been tainted with blood. However, his crescent blade hasn't touched his opponent yet. It was a one-sided battle. He was already exhausted and it won't be long before he would fall. \"Fool, you will become one of my family\" resounded the opponent's voice, as the challenger crumbled to the floor and was turned into sand.\n\nThe Fighting Instinct Tournament, or FIST, is a tournament as fierce as its name suggests. There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/d3zn5rvebib2t4sko0ot.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Synapse Software Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Brøderbund Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":28708,"name":"Battlefront","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Battlefront is a wargame set during World War II.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gl4sdvyc3eihzjg6zwra.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategic Studies Group","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":28709,"name":"Robot Rascals","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/btgyal52muxqe8qaxojx.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ozark Softscape","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":28710,"name":"Crash of Cars","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"REAL-TIME MULTIPLAYER game where your goal is to collect as many crowns as possible before getting destroyed. \n \nUse power-ups and smash into opponents to destroy them; then swoop in and take any crowns that they drop.

Dozens of versions and tributes to the game, both official and unofficial, have been created for virtually every computer, console, handheld, tablet, phone, and operating system in the decades since its original release. It is undoubtedly a classic from the golden era of arcade games.\n\nShoot The Rocks is a little different in that it runs cross-platform, on both desktop and laptop computers, as well as on iOS and Android phones and tablets. This is thanks to the fact that it runs in browser using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, rather than Adobe's proprietary Flash platform. This means that no special plugins are required and, if you have a recent version of a mainstream browser, you should be good to go.\n\nIn Shoot The Rocks the aim of the game is to defend your ship from wave after wave of incoming asteroids and flying saucers. This sounds simple but quickly becomes very challenging, and you'll need to use every trick of fancy flying available to you - plus hyperspace, shield, and flip functions - to stay in the game.\n\nShoot The Rocks combines elements of both the original Asteroids, along with its follow-up, Asteroids Plus, with its own unique spin to create an engaging and addictive game. Two modes of play are offered. Classic mode aims to play as much like the original asteroids as possible, whilst the modern mode offers a slightly different take that should appeal to both fans of the original and newer players.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pk4gnb0wmycg3umezsqb.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"arcade.ly","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":28769,"name":"Mr. Donovan","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Harness your MOBA skills, and dominate the first of the SOBOs!

Like SimCity, it requires you to build a functioning metropolis. However, City Life also adds a social aspect to the game. Your city is populated by citizens of six different economic classifications, from \"Have-Nots\" to \"Blue Collars\" to \"Elites\". Each social stratus has its own needs, some of which conflict with the needs of the other social classes. So you have to balance the social needs of your citizens as well as the zoning needs of your city. You have to adapt your strategies according to the citizens' needs, who communicate with you. \n \nA large amount of detailed structures is available, both commercial and residential. There are 22 maps with different goals, but an editor has been included to design custom maps, or you can start in the sandbox mode. Custom maps and scenarios can be exported and shared with other players. City Life is powered by a full 3D engine, allowing for full rotation and zooming as if you are walking in your own streets.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/n6tkbwg32m4usqvvq0bz.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":28980,"name":"City Life Deluxe","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"City Life: World Edition keeps all the great aspects of the original and expands the possibilities through exciting new content and features.
