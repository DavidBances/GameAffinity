This time around, character growth is a major gameplay feature. Players earn experience for defeating enemies and level up, with underleveled characters much more likely to have trouble beating late-game bosses. There are three game modes. \"Plot\" features seven stages with a regular difficulty level designed for regular players. \"Online Ranking\" is a more challenging eight-stage mode which, when completed, provides the player with a code to input at the official website in order to share their codes on the online leaderboard. \"Challenge Boss\" is a boss rush that goes through all of the bosses in the game, with players challenged to get through in as little time as possible.\n\nThis is the first game for the PGM2 to feature support for the hardware's card reader accessory. By buying an IC card at their local arcade, players gain the ability to save and load their character's progress, allowing them to keep their level growth and items between runs.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dy3l0kmh2jxfshypdidl.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"International Games System","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":82758,"name":"Mary's Adventure","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from slice salami.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qefwf5rcacnoczlouaqa.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82761,"name":"HypnoCuck: The Arrogant Rich Bitch Till She Falls","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from akadashi no misoshiru.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/p26qdmihl43m4p6ruk1y.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82762,"name":"Quest & Quest 3D: Short Short - Female Adventurer Sina","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from Ashita ha docchida!?.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/c9geqbc1x9z6e8ocwefn.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82763,"name":"Quest & Quest 3D: Short Short - Female Adventurer Arcana","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from Ashita ha docchida!?.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cpsmb4jsewcx1tqqh3yp.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82764,"name":"Monster Girl * Fusion","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from Biollante.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/egqs7gg3m6kx3lwz79xd.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82765,"name":"Beeeeeeeam","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A puzzle game from Alignment Sharp.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ylxcxesp4kvtks8dzcht.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82766,"name":"The Incomplete \"Wish\" 01. saidohirakareruhakono","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A visual novel from shiresese.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/x7ojguhkunhng31sqnsp.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82767,"name":"Tatsuno Quest","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from PinkMimic.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/np9hybtvxmtvtlrlve7w.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82768,"name":"Magician of Fallen","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from Clara Soap.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/f1awneqkum28b0blstba.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82769,"name":"The Weakened Demon Lord and His Servant's Business: Please Give Me Your White Fluid","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A role-playing game from Tsukudaninosato.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xvkaturbsoa6tvyrisxi.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":82772,"name":"Everyone's Idol Yumeru-chan!

Player level and equipment progression have been streamlined so that players can jump into the punishment. Hours of challenging and rewarding gameplay are guaranteed in this tense screen crusher.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co24b5.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tenbirds","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"TROOOZE","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":83021,"name":"MU Origin","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"MU Origin is a popular mobile MMORPG develop by Webzen Inc.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zr0u1oeoz27jgyeex3w4.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":83022,"name":"Tubocity","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tubocity is an endless runner where players pilot a spaceship through a tube, avoiding oncoming gates blocking their path.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/asnrfaeud3oraddiq3ks.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Whitepot Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":83024,"name":"Ero Oni","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An adventure game from ADOOM.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zst3ni0kbqk2mevs8hew.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":83025,"name":"Sweet Liquid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A visual novel from Katsudou Mangaya.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cx9s1k1bwx1tw5ynwdka.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":83026,"name":"Hiiragi Iwashi","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A visual novel from Katsudou Mangaya.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/edl8yc9t2iicmwjqczgz.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":83028,"name":"If you became a toyboy doll and were picked up by a girl with perverted personality","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An adventure game from ThreadPIN.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ibztoehom0576vx7nean.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":83029,"name":"Harukaze Sensation!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A visual novel from Windmill Oasis.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":83030,"name":"Wizards Complex","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It‚Äôs already been several years since it was confirmed that witches existed around the world.
