It's a possibility that concept art or screenshots of this early version will be revealed in the upcoming art book, as Nintendo is open to talking about Metroid Dread's development history.\n\nLiam Robertson of Unseen64 claims that a synopsis of the game was given out to select members of the press. And in 2010, IGN's Craig Harris said in a podcast that he had seen a complete script for Metroid Dread, and that \"Nintendo could use it anytime they wanted.\" It's possible that this was the synopsis that Liam Robertson was referring to.

Bubble Tea gained such popularity globally that it was officially announced as a new emoji on this day in 2020.\n\nThis Taiwanese drink started as a local treat and has exploded in popularity over the last few decades.

Traditional tearooms across Asia have also joined in on the boba craze, and the trend has reached countries like Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and more!\n\nSatisfy your craving and make a yummy cup of bubble tea in today’s interactive Doodle, which features Taiwan’s indigenous Formosan Mountain Dog as well as a crew of familiar Doodle characters!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9ew7.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Google","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":233982,"name":"Michael Jackson in Scramble Training","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Michael Jackson in Scramble Training is a Sega AS-1 motion simulator game developed by Sega AM3 and manufactured by Sega.
