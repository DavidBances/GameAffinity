The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.\n\nThe general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.\n\nThe game has several mode to choose from:\nArcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an “A” or an “S” rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.\nHome Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.\nSudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends.\nSurvival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.\nVideo Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.\nTutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.\nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song).\n\nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs. As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fhaor0klumb1pzzetorn.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":20895,"name":"Ballance","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Ballance, you control a sphere with the simple objective of navigating it to the end of each of the game's 12 linear levels.

Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.\n\nTaking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.\n\nPlayers steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.\n\nThe world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67mq.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Keita Takahashi","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NOW Production","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":3965,"name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam: Senshi-tachi no Kiseki","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7l55.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}]},{"id":273148,"name":"Community Build Project 5","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Community build project with a dark, scary, snowy city map","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":73536,"name":"Blades of Avernum","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Blades of Avernum is a fantasy role-playing system that includes four follow-up adventures to the Avernum series as well as a scenario creator for users to make their own.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30p5.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Spiderweb Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":25419,"name":"Crystal Key 2: The Far Realm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This first person adventure game sees the player attempt to stop an alien invasion of earth.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8eyg.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Earthlight Productions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kheops Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The Adventure Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":273179,"name":"Jungle Tour 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A canyon styled map with tropical scenery.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":200593,"name":"Barbie Mermaid Adventure","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Barbie Mermaid Adventure, Barbie assumes the role of a specimen of that mythical fish-human hybrid, the mermaid, and plans a party with all of her undersea friends.

Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core.

Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.\n\nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree).

The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch.\n\nThe action is fast-paced and smooth.
