It is now listed under Quests and Adventures, since there is no New Lands category.\n\nThey said it couldn't be done... Daggerfall is too big to fit in the TESV engine... And they were, on the one hand, right! You cannot capture the grand scale or the nearly endless possibilities that exist in a world larger than England! Yet, for all of its vastness and promise, Daggerfall remains a world unfamiliar to many Elder Scrolls fans. The mechanics and graphics feel dated to say the least, and its sometimes unreasonable time limits for quests as well as quest-breaking bugs left many players, even back in the '90's, so frustrated that perhaps a majority of players never finished the Main Quest, preferring to simply explore the world on their own terms, joining guilds or Knightly Orders, or becoming a vampire or a wereboar. And that is a shame, because the Main Quest is actually quite a good story. The purpose of this mod is not to replace TESII: Daggerfall, but to bring some of its magic and lore to Elder Scrolls fans of the Skyrim generation that would never otherwise experience it, as well as perhaps delight those fans of the original game that would love to see the Main Quest in an updated engine, complete with voice acting, re-mastered music and better graphics.\n\nPlease note that the Main Quest of Daggerfall is NOT about choice. You are role-playing as the Emperor's friend on an important mission, so, while the order in which you tackle these quests is your choice, it is assumed that you want to finish the Main Quest and so you will not be able to refuse the quest-givers' requests. At this point, there really isn't much of anything other than the Main Quest for you to do in Daggerfall, anyway!\n\nI have worked on this mod in my spare time for a little over two years, and have had a lot of fun learning about various aspects that go into making a large mod the size of a dlc. I'm not much of a 3D artist, so I've had to rely on a lot of resources to put this mod together, and you will see that the credits list is quite long. I have tried to include, where possible, those models from artists who have made resources to see something from Daggerfall come to later Elder Scrolls games, such as JMan0WarS, who remade Privateer's Hold for Morrowind as well as Direnni Tower for Oblivion, Lord Berandas and BobJohnson99. As per Bethesda's instructions, all assets included in this mod for Skyrim have been remade, and not simply ported from the original Daggerfall game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9do9.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":316727,"name":"Life Without You","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Life Without You is a simulation of sitting at the computer, immersing you in the harsh atmosphere of Patience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8t92.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"akhsotoen","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":316728,"name":"Mirage 7","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mirage 7 is a dark fairytale, a third-person adventure with a unique blend of fantasy and sci-fi.

Mayu needs to earn ¥100,000 by the end of October, or she’ll be kicked out!\n\nBeing evicted from her home would be bad enough, but Mayu has a secret: she’s actually a vampire. Mayu hasn’t been a vampire for a full year yet, and the church is keeping close tabs on her to ensure she’s been behaving herself. According to the stone-faced Sister Juriel, it’s the church’s standard policy to execute all vampires without a fixed address, lest they start roaming the streets causing chaos.\n\nIf Mayu can’t pay the rent in time, she won’t just wind up homeless: she’ll be executed! What’s a fledgeling vampire to do?\n\nAssume control of Mayu and manage these tumultuous two weeks of her life. Help her raise money to avoid a grisly end, all while managing her stress levels and forming relationships with girls over the internet. You never know: come Halloween, Mayu might be able to land a date, and she might even get to nibble on a cute girl’s neck!\n\nDo your best, and don’t let this upcoming Halloween be Mayu’s last! She’s counting on you!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8x0j.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ebi-Hime","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":316907,"name":"Jessica's Bow Wow Bistro","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Jessica's looking to expand her cupcake shop by dishing up premium pet treats!

A fisherman's tale, once filled with dreams of bountiful catch, turned sinister by the unknown.\n\nCatch fish and journey to the enigmatic market, hidden far to the west, shrouded in darkness and secrecy. There, an unworldly buyer awaits, inscrutable and foreboding. Be wary, for the coins that burst forth in the market's belly are no mere trinkets but carry a haunting aura of evil.\n\nYet, as you brave this treacherous path, beware the malevolence that lurks unseen. For in the shadows of ancient trees, treehuggers skulk, eager to snatch your hard-earned catch and curse you with a darkness that spreads through your very being. My skin, once tanned by the sun, now turns black like theirs, a mark of doom that lingers. We are them.\n\nI implore you, weary traveler, to wield caution and wit, for the lake's dark secrets have claimed countless fishermen before you. Their dreams of riches and glory swallowed whole by the lake's insatiable hunger. Tread lightly, for it thirsts for more souls to claim, entangling its victims in an eternal struggle.\n\nYour journey's end beckons in the shop beyond, far to the east. Procure the enigmatic items it holds, and only then may you dare to hope for liberation - to \"release him.\" But I beg you, heed my warning and break the cycle of this wicked game. Turn back, return to the safety of your home shores, and forsake the haunting allure of this macabre endeavor. Your life, your soul, they are precious, and this game is nothing but a cruel, treacherous ruse.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SamBunch","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":316954,"name":"Number Sums","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Number Sums is a challenging number puzzle to train your mental arithmetic.
