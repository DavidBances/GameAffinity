An anomaly means that for example something (e.g. a piece of furniture) has moved, an extra object has appeared or something has disappeared. There's also scary intruders. When you notice something is different in any of the monitored rooms you have to file a report by clicking on the anomaly or choosing the right location and type of the anomaly from a menu to fix it.
