A small humanoid robot wakes up in the debris of a landfill inside a large factory.\nHe receives strange and enigmatic messages, from someone who apparently wants to help him. The robot's purpose is to explore the large factory where he is in search of answers about who he and his mysterious remote helper are.\nThe player does not control the robot directly and in real time, but inserts movement commands above its display in order to tell the robot when it is time to jump, to crouch and more.\nIt is therefore a puzzle game based on perspective: the player must calculate the spaces between the robot and the obstacles. The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance, they will be more and more dynamic and varied.\nFor example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles.\nThe real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the \"\"gold chip\"\" of that particular level.\nThe \"\"gold chip\"\" will be used to unlock new skins for our robot. This title is therefore suitable both for those looking for a relaxing puzzle, given the non-dynamic gameplay, and for those looking for a challenge given its arcade nature.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5p22.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"7 Raven Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":221481,"name":"Relayer Advanced","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This game depicts the fierce battle between the \"Starchildren\" and the extraterrestrial \"Relayer\" and lets you use the \"Hate\" and \"Big Bang\" systems to lead the battle to victory!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5hjo.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Dragami Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kadokawa Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":221206,"name":"Mosaique Neko Waifus 5","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unique hentai puzzle about flirting with cute anime Neko girls. \"Neko Waifus\" is a series loved by millions around the world.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5qd1.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Lil Hentai Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":221154,"name":"The Villager and the Werewolf","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this game, when you fit the last piece of each jigsaw, you will hear a fantastic werewolf story written by Marta Machado and illustrated by Alexandre Rocha.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7il3.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":220763,"name":"Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid Burst Forth!!
