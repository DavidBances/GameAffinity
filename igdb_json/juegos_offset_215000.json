You are now trapped in the Land of Keynesium.\n\nYou and your opponent are represented by the animated figures which appear at the lower right and the lower left of the maze entrance. The net worth of each figure is directly below it. Each player starts off with $500,000. Two Keynesian robots are in the center of the screen atop the maze entrance. Every maze is a game within a game. You and your opponent are playing against the robots which represent different factors of the economy. But you are also playing against each other. You will be changing strategies throughout the game - sometimes cooperating with the robots to thwart your opponent - sometimes collaborating with your opponent to beat the robots.\n\nEach maze offers you the opportunity to make money or the chance to hang onto what money you have. An electronic signal will appear center screen to tell you which to expect - and how much cash is at stake.\n\nThe right hand control unit activates the right hand figure. The left hand control unit controls the left hand figure. Push the joy stick away from you to make your player go up. Pull the joy stick toward you to make your player travel downward. Push right to go right. Push left to go left.\n\nThe Keynesian robots are controlled by the computer. The brighter robots represent the lighter side of the economy like income, bull markets and successful investments. These robots are elusive and will try to run from you - but the more quickly you catch them, the more money you'll make.\n\nThe darker robots represent the gloomier side of the economy - things like taxes, inflation and bear markets. They will try to catch you wherever you are in the maze. But the longer you stay away from them, the more money you'll keep. It's possible to find a hiding place in the maze where the darker robots can't find you.\n\nThere are seven kinds of mazes. INCOME, REWARD and INVESTMENT offer you an opportunity to make money. EXPENSES, THIEF, TAXES and INFLATION will force deductions from your net worth unless you completely elude the robots during these maze sequences. The amount of money at stake in each maze will appear at the lower center of the screen. After a moment, the numbers will start decreasing. The dark robots will speed up and the brighter robots will slow down as the $ at stake decrease. The number on the screen at the instant you make contact with a robot will be automatically computed into your net worth.\n\nYou will find that the Keynesian robots are small enough to maneuver freely through the mazes. But you are too tall to travel through some of the narrow passageways without ducking your head. You do this by pressing the action button on your hand control. It is harder to run in this position, so your player will only be going at two-thirds speed. If you do not press the action button when you make contact with a low ceiling in the maze, the computer will do it for you automatically, but you will only be able to run at half speed.\n\nThe walls and ceilings of the maze contain a high energy charge. If any part of your player's body comes in contact with any part of the maze, you must break that contact before proceeding with your run.\n\nDepartment of Dirty Tricks! Once you make contact with a robot, it is good strategy to harass your opponent. If you touch your opponent and a part of the maze at the same time, your opponent will lose control of his player.\n\nDepartment of Economic Cooperation! If you and your opponent outmaneuver the robots and make them run into each other, they'll automatically return to their starting positions. You'll gain both time and money.\n\nThe first player to achieve a net worth of more than one million dollars wins. The Keynesians will salute your triumph with a blast of electronic trumpets - and reward you with two tickets on the next time machine scheduled to make a stop in the Twentieth Century.\n\nShort games. You can play against the clock or with a goal of $750,000 instead of a million.\n\nLonger games. You can play for any dollar figure you choose. TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN has more than a trillion different maze combinations.

This number will decrease by one every time a direct hit is scored.\n\nThe number at the lower right of your screen represents the quantums of energy units in your fuel receptors. These energy units are expressed in megajoules.\n\nYou will start your mission with 1000 megajoules. One megajoule per second is used to sustain flight. A laser burst uses ten megajoules of energy.

Only one enemy ship will appear on the screen at a time.\n\nWhen an enemy Imperial star fighter flashes in from hyperspace, a general ALERT will sound and flash on the screen. It is important to fix the ship in your sights quickly and fire before he comes within his own firing range and costs you energy units necessary to activate your deflector shields. The star fighters will come at you from a variety of angles. It is safer strategy to outmaneuver the ones that come at you from diagonals. They require very sophisticated precision tracking. You will save megajoules by firing at those that come head-on or appear in more easily tracked vertical and horizontal courses. You can take evasive action from a star fighter only by climbing or diving to get the ship completely off-screen. If you go right or left, the fighter will continue to follow you.\n\nThere are five enemy star fighters to protect the ten enemy invasion transports and battle frigates.

Some machines also had a decorative 'ball return' on the front at the very bottom of the cabinet. There is an interesting story behind that. At the time the game was created, Exidy had just purchased Fun Games and had a number of cabinets left over from one of Fun's driving games. They used these cabinets to get Robot Bowl into production quickly. The only problem was that the cabinets had a hole in the front where the gas pedal had been. Michael Cooper-Hart suggested that they silk-screen the words 'Ball Return' over the hole.\n\nThe Robot Bowl cocktail was a square box with a perfectly round top. The player controls were on either side of the monitor (and you actually had to look at the game sideways to play).

Cinematronics worked with Rosenthal to produce the Space Wars system.\nTwo players controlled different ships. One button rotated the ship left, another rotated the ship right, one engaged thrust, one fired a shell, and one entered hyperspace (which causes the ship to disappear and reappear elsewhere on the playfield at random).\nThe game offered a number of gameplay options, including the presence or absence of a star in the middle of the playfield (which exerted a positive or negative gravitational pull), whether the edges of the playfield \"wrapped around\" to their opposite sides, and whether shells bounced. Three other fascinating features were unique to this game. First, the game could not be played in \"one player\" mode; a human opponent was required. Second, the player's ship could take a glancing hit without dying, but would suffer damage; a cloud of loose ship fragments would break off and float away, after which the ship would be visibly damaged on screen and would turn and accelerate more slowly. Third and most memorable was that the duration of play for any contest was solely governed by the amount of money deposited; each quarter bought a minute and a half of play. A dollar bought six minutes, and for a ten dollar roll of quarters two players could play non-stop for an hour.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ud3.jpg","releaseYear":1977,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":18609,"name":"Depthcharge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Depthcharge is a single-player arcade game released in 1977 by Gremlin Industries for the Sega VIC Dual system board.

The game was developed for the multi-user interactive computer-based education PLATO system and programmed in the TUTOR programming language and utilized scalable vector graphics called linesets. A 1977 development of Panther, with more refined graphics, was named Panzer.\n\nThe game features team-based deathmatch. There are two teams, Squares and Triangles. The object of the game is to destroy the opposing team's base. Game play is straightforward; the player selects a pseudonym and a team, traverse the terrain looking for enemies to destroy on the way to their base. Perspective is maintained by the use of scalable vector graphics and visual interest is enhanced with special graphics for explosions using a custom character set to accomplish limited raster graphics animation.\n\nWhen players enter the game their tanks are placed randomly in the playing arena near their bases and are temporarily camouflaged to allow time to orient themselves with the current map and state of play. The initial view of the game is in \"on-board\" mode, which is a first-person perspective of the arena. The other main view available is the map which shows the 5 mountains (Crag, Nixon, Og, Pathos, and Red) which vary in size and placement each time a new game is started. On the map view players can see all of their team members positions and can see enemies only when they are within range. Messaging between team members is available and broadcast-style messages (insults) to the opposing team are also allowed. Team coordination and cooperation is critical to winning in this game as each player has different skills, some players are better at hunting down and killing enemies (or at least engaging and distracting them), others are good at hiding and sneaking to the opposing base to begin bombardment. An interesting capability of the game is that players can donate ammunition and fuel to other players in order to facilitate their role in the game. Ammunition and fuel are loaded at the player's base.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7w06.jpg","releaseYear":1975,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PLATO"}]},{"id":171851,"name":"Bullet Mark","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A light gun game by Sega released in 1975.

The game owed its success to offering just enough variables to make a complex challenge for users, but still providing a simply-grasped addictive introduction to the offsetting priorities facing a business. The choice of the right prices and quantities on the day of a heat-wave could instill the satisfaction unique to a greatly profitable private enterprise.\n\nThe player is first given a weather report for the day (sunny, cloudy or hot and dry, each accompanied by a color drawing) and is prompted for three values: the number of glasses of lemonade to make, the number of advertising signs, and the cost of lemonade per glass. The program then gives a report of the earnings for that day. A thunderstorm, sometimes occurring on cloudy days and accompanied by a color animation, will void any profits and cause the player to lose any investment for the day. The game can be played either single-player or with up to 30 players (each player is independent and the sales of one do not affect another).

Players wander around a maze, being capable of moving backward or forwards, turning right or left in 90-degree increments, and peeking through doorways. The game also uses simple tile-based movement, where the player moves from square to square. Other players are seen as eyeballs. When a player sees another player, they can shoot or otherwise negatively affect them. Players gain points for shooting other players, and lose them for being shot.

A player of the game enters commands to move through the rooms or to shoot \"crooked arrows\" along a tunnel into one of the adjoining rooms. There are twenty rooms, each connecting to three others, arranged like the vertices of a dodecahedron or the faces of an icosahedron (which are identical in layout). Hazards include bottomless pits, super bats (which drop the player in a random location, a feature duplicated in later, commercially published adventure games, such as Zork I, Valley of the Minotaur, and Adventure), and the Wumpus itself. The Wumpus is described as having sucker feet (to escape the bottomless pits) and being too heavy for a super bat to lift. When the player has deduced from hints which chamber the Wumpus is in without entering the chamber, he fires an arrow into the Wumpus's chamber to kill it. The player wins the game if he kills the Wumpus. However, firing the arrow into the wrong chamber startles the Wumpus, which may cause it to move to an adjacent room.

Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer.
