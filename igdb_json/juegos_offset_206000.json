Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.\n\nTaking off and landing however, also requires additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try not to run over him...yet).\n\nYour weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).\n\nAfter each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qtls4fg4vgs1rlfohojn.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 7800"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":12284,"name":"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can always have another go at them if you fail. \n \nFirst task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit.

Tightwad, whom the circus owes $10,000, arrives on the scene with the intent of demolishing the circus unless it can pay up. He plans to build a set of luxury hotels on the terrain. In a fit of desperation, the ringmaster organises a display of six events to raise money for the doomed circus: diving, juggling, trapeze, knife throwing, tightrope and the human cannonball. The performance in each event is judged by five clown judges, who offer money depending on the quality of the show. The businessman has no intention of letting the circus raise the cash though, and he sends his lackey, the evil Fiendish Freddy, to sabotage the acts.\nEach player is represented by a circus animal (tiger, lion, bear, etc.)\n\nThe game was similar to many of the multi-event sports games of the time such as Epyx' California Games, Winter Games and Summer Games. However, Fiendish Freddy differed not only by its surroundings (circus events) offering a comedy element, it also offered a plot and a clear goal of winning $10,000. The six events were thus:\n\nThe player is challenged to jump off four diving boards of increasing height into containers of water of decreasing size, beginning with a huge wooden container, and ending in a glass of water. (The third target, however, is a cement block, a possible homage to the Looney Tunes cartoon Big Top Bunny, amongst other things.) Money is earned by completing all four levels, as well as performing a set series of stunts. Freddy attempts to hinder the player by blowing the diver off course with an enormous hair dryer; he appears if the diver fails to complete the stunt in time.\n\nThe player must make their way through four juggling sessions of increasing difficulty. Each level brings more balls to juggle, but not just balls - sometimes babies get lost in the mass and must be thrown back into their prams. Of course, Freddy throws a surprise or two into the mix, in the form of bombs, which can be thrown back at Freddy to consequently explode in his face, or missiles which must be juggled as per other objects. Dropping bombs or missiles will cause them to explode and kill the juggler.\nThe juggler is allowed five mistakes (marked by dots changing from green to red) before the game is over. Missing five times without dying from a bomb or missile leads an off-stage performer to use a cane to grab the juggler and yank him off screen.\n\nThe aim of this section is to proceed from right to left over three levels, jumping from rope to rope. Along the way there are rings of fire and moving targets which have to be mastered. Freddy, as usual, is omnipresent with a jet pack and large pair of scissors to cut your act short if you are too slow.\nSights on the ground, ranging from a marching band and organ to a trainer with his elephant, are also present as a possible distraction, although it can also be argued that the former are providing the music for the act.\n\nThe player must throw knives at balloons on a rotating wheel with a female assistant strapped to it. The assistant is not a target, and will scream if hit, as well as the screen getting covered in blood. There are a limited number of knives available. If the player does not manage to burst all of the balloons before the time or knives run out, it's over. Freddy contributes to the challenge once in a while by throwing smoke grenades in to hinder the player's vision.\n\nThe player must walk across three tightropes armed only with a pole to keep balance. Freddy intervenes occasionally with his jet pack, attempting to knock the player off the rope, or with razor blades to cut the player in half.

Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the PC Engine with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.\n\nThe player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.\n\nThough the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.\n\nThe controls are mostly unchanged from R-Type, where the 8-way joystick controls the ship's movement, and the shot button fires the ship's main beam. The other button is used to equip or unequip Force; the series' most unusual innovation. Pressing down the shot button causes the blue beam gauge to fill up, and releasing the button causes a wave beam to travel a certain distance depending on the length of time the button was pressed down. If the button is pressed down until the blue gauge is fully charged, a red gauge appears and fills up quickly. Filling up the red gauge causes it to flash blue and red, releasing the shot button at this point shoots an even more powerful beam.\n\nUnlike the normal beam that only travels in a straight line, the newly added Shotgun Laser beam explodes in multiple directions after traveling a short distance. This shot causes heavy damage if the player can target a single enemy with it. However, holding the button down after the gauge is flashing causes the beam to return to the normal transverse beam (the gauge alternates between flashing and returning to the normal state while the button is held down), so the player must release the button at the right timing in order to successfully target enemies. The other newly added beam, the Search Laser, is semi-homing, and can bend at angles up to 45°.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2z0j.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":6818,"name":"Nastar","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rastan Saga II (ラスタンサーガ2?), known in Europe as Nastar and in North America as Nastar Warrior (except for the North American Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version, which was known as Rastan Saga II) is a hack and slash platform arcade game developed and released by Taito in 1988.

You can also circle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the player to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time.\n\nThe dragon can also spit fireballs. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power; at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon's head. The game also contains some platforming elements - the human is able to dismount on horizontal platforms.\n\nPower-ups can be acquired by shooting small green dragons that appear intermittently throughout the levels, or they can be collected from the ground on foot. There are four different power-ups, each of which provides a different weapon to the dragon. Collecting multiple power-ups of the same colour makes that weapon more powerful. The dragon changes colour depending upon which power-up has been collected. Red enables the dragon to breathe a flame. The flame gets longer if more power-ups are collected. Yellow enables the dragon's body to fire crescents in all directions. White enables the dragon to produce up to four miniature dragons, which home in on enemies.

Players then proceed through each level, killing monsters and bosses, collecting keys to unlock doors and collecting gold and experience. Gold is also taken from slain foes and treasure chests. Villages sell items, weapons, armor and (in the console versions) extra lives, with each village encountered providing better equipment. Some villagers and benevolent creatures will also provide information. The arcade version has a limited game time, which can be extended by buying progressively more expensive hourglasses at shops, or by picking up rare bonuses. In shops, and in hidden places, are medicinal herbs which restore 10 HP if brought to zero, and antidotes which cure poison inflicted by specific foes. There are also two elixirs in the game that act like medicinal herbs, except that they restore all HP.\n\nThere are five stages in the game. Stages one, two and four consist of two worlds, above and below ground. Stage three consists of three worlds. Stage five is set entirely within Castle Cadash.

Fuji, Mt. Keirin, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, Angkor Wat, Ayers Rock, the Taj Mahal, Leningrad, Paris, London, Barcelona, Athens, Egypt, Kenya, New York, Maya ruins, Antarctica, and finally Easter Island.\n\nEach location has a unique background that shows the area's most famous landmarks. The stages contain a different layout of blocks, some that disappear after being shot, others that do not, and still others that are hidden and can reveal bonuses.\n\nThe stages start with differing numbers and sizes of balloons. The largest balloon divides for the first three times it is popped; after the fourth and smallest balloon is popped it vanishes. Each player starts with a single harpoon. When a balloon is popped, special weapons may drop down.\n\nAt a certain point in the stage, a food item will drop down that is worth several thousand bonus points.\n\nIf a player touches a balloon of any size, the player dies and both players must start the stage again.\n\nWhen both players touch a balloon at the same time, only Player 1 will lose a life but this is somewhat offset because when both players reach a bonus or weapon simultaneously only Player 1 will get it.\n\nPlayers start with 3-5 lives depending on the dip switch setting. Extra lives are also given when certain point totals have been accumulated. The stage ends when all of the balloons are successfully cleared. The game ends after all stages have been completed and our heroic duo ride their jeep into the sunset on an Easter Island beach.\n\nIn some later versions, there are more than 17 locations.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mrh.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":125469,"name":"Dà Fùwēng","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2r50.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":48907,"name":"Softball Tengoku","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"With 60 characters with different abilities and appearance, this is softball unlike you ever experienced before.

Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level.

In addition to this, some combinations are possible. The Turtles can throw Foot soldiers overhead, and by pressing the jump and attack buttons, a special attack is performed. Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a sweeping jump attack with their weapons. Turtles can also spring off the wall in certain areas. Enemies can be defeated more quickly by slamming them into walls or solid objects.

The story-line is a parody of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, where two main characters, Goku and Chao, embark upon separate journeys to find one another.\n\nIn Yuuyuki, the \"Change Character\" command can switch between a maximum of five different characters. However, there are very few points in the game where it can actually be used to such extent. Its main use is to switch between Goku and the others accompanying him. Like Shin Onigashima, the character in use can greatly affect the descriptive text shown on screen, and the significant increase in number of characters allowed for more variety in each scene. It is possible to enjoy the game by viewing the reactions towards choosing completely unrelated characters or commands in certain situations.\n\nWhile Shin Onigashima demanded rather complex puzzle-solving abilities, Yuuyuki mainly focuses on having the player carefully read and understand the story-line. Puzzles are solved easily in this game, and very few choices actually lead to a \"game over\" screen. Easy trivia questions and simple action gameplay emerge at certain points, and players may find themselves searching for the obvious answer on screen more often than thinking hard to solve the puzzle at hand.\n\nMain changes in gameplay from Shin Onigashima include the implementation of the \"Ittaisan\" command, which saves progress at any point during the game, and faster animation of game text.

The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.

The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.\n\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \"Eight Dog Chronicles\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \"dog\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations.
