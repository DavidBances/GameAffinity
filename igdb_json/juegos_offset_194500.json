For example, the player cannot increase his ship speed until a speed icon is picked up; additional speed icons further increase the ship velocity.\n\nSeveral weapons, when additionally upgraded, turn into a 'super' weapon for approximately ten seconds. If the player has the ripple laser, and then gets another icon for it, the player will receive the high-powered Buster ripple for a short period of time. Options have been slightly changed with the arrival of 'option seeds', which are small options that orbit the ship firing only the basic initial shot. Two option seeds can combine into one full option. Moreover, options can also be sacrificed to utilize a short-term homing beam weapon.\n\nSeveral enemy bosses typical to Gradius games return, including the Brain Golem (the first level boss) and the Tetran (the second level boss). There are a total of six levels. Since the game is similar to its prequel, Salamander 2 does not use the Revival Start feature from Gradius (which pushes the player back to a pre-determined checkpoint if a life is lost), many people consider this title to be easier than other titles in the Gradius series due to this. Once the game has been completed, it starts its second-loop at a much higher difficulty. The music is also changed to remixed versions of Salamander's music in some stages. The first player's ship is called Vic Viper while the second player's ship is Super Cobra.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2z0k.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":655,"name":"Conquest of the New World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Interesting gameplay featuring exploration, management and combat\nInfinite replayability on customizable, computer-generated worlds\nDiscovering the uncharted during the Age of Exploration era","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yb9.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":170053,"name":"Legend of the Silver Talisman","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Long time ago, the people of Yoneda lived in peace protected by the magical Silver Talisman, created by the Council of the Grand Wizards.

The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).\n\nVersus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.\n\nThe \"free practice\" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps.

Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's \"clown\" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. \"Chains\" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster.\n\nThere are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3u7t.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo AES"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":3719,"name":"Kirby Super Star","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kirby Super Star, released as Kirby's Fun Pak in PAL regions, is a platforming video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2c6p.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":134457,"name":"Kirby no Omochabako: Ball Rally","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Kirby's Toy Box - Ball Rally, the player's goal is to guide Kirby through an obstacle course.

This makes the game much easier to pick up and play well than its contemporaries, but it compensates for this reduced difficulty with fiendish (if somewhat unrealistic) course layouts and highly variable wind.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ij3.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo Pocket Color"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo MVS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo AES"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":18992,"name":"Skipper & Skeeto: Tales from Paradise Park","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Danish point-and-click adventure game with some edutainment content.
