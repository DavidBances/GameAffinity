The player is presented with a fixed view of a valley and a number of icons that are used to play the game. The objective of the game is to make the valley flourish by tapping on the icons in the correct order. If unsuccessful the player will lose by either running out of icons to tap on or by triggering a major disastrous event. Each time an icon is tapped it will go up in level and it is when all icons has reached their maximum levels that the game is won.\n\nAll the icons (except for one) pollute the environment in different ways. This includes leaving garbage, building factories, cutting down trees, spilling chemicals, polluting the air and dispersing oil. The final icon is a heart which can be used to revoke damage. When one icon is tapped it can have an effect on the levels of other icons. For example building a factory can lead to more air pollution or trees being cut down. In this way all icons can be leveled to max even if they are just tapped once. When starting out levels are divided into sub-levels which means that the player manually clicks on icons to see these effects being played out. Later on a quick play mode can be unlocked where effects happen automatically.\n\nBy leveling up icons the player earns greencoins that can be used in the game store to buy hints on how to succeed with the game. By discovering different scenes the player can also earn stars which are needed to turn on the quick play mode. Greencoins can also be used to unlock a fast forward button and to reveal the current levels of the icons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ab4.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Crafty Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"BulkyPix","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":262076,"name":"Push The Squares","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Push The Squares is a new game in which you have to find the proper way to connect squares with stars of the same color.\nWill you be able to complete all the +100 levels of the game?","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7tul.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ketchapp Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":257225,"name":"Smarter Than You","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Smarter Than You is an asynchronous duel not unlike an iterated game of \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\".

Utilizing the power of the next generation consoles, and building off the critically-acclaimed NHL Collision Physics system, every player on the ice is governed by physics at all times. Feel the hard-hitting chaos of NHL hockey through true-to-life secondary collisions, net scrambles and player pileups, capturing the desperation of every shift.\n\nREAL PUCK PHYSICS\nThe puck is one of the most complex items in the game to authentically replicate and it finally gets its due in NHL 15. Completely rebuilt puck physics result in a more realistic feel to every puck interaction. Everything on the ice, including the ice surface itself, is live which leads to the unpredictable and authentic puck spins, rolls and bounces seen in a real NHL game.\n\nAUTHENTIC PLAYER & EQUIPMENT MODELS\nThe Next Generation Hockey Player has been rebuilt from the ice up. Now player models have three distinct layers - the body, equipment, and jersey. Each layer interacts independently, making every contact with the puck or other players even more realistic. Dynamic Cloth technology adds an extra layer of realism as it reacts to the player’s movement as they explode up the ice, helping bring the speed of the game to life.\n\nUNPRECEDENTED PLAYER LIKENESS\nPowered by the same technology that brought the most realistic representation of the athlete to EA SPORTS UFC, NHL 15 delivers groundbreaking player likeness, emotion and animation. From the strides a player takes to get up the ice to the emotion on their face after scoring a game winning goal, the players are as real as they’ve ever been.\n\nSUPERSTAR SKILL STICK\nNow all the tools of an NHL superstar are in your hands. The revolutionary Skill Stick has evolved to give even more control to the player. Protect the puck, receive passes without breaking stride, and discover an arsenal of sweet new dekes, all with an intuitive right stick control scheme that is easy to use but packed with depth.\n\nAUTHENTIC ARENAS\nThere is no feeling like being there, and we are giving you the best seats in the house. The power of the next-gen consoles finally allows the NHL franchise to capture every detail of an NHL arena. Unique arena elements from 19,000+ seat capacities to lighting and player entrance tunnels are captured with a level of detail not possible on the previous generation. Now those home games will truly feel like home.\n\nNEW COMMENTARY TEAM\nNew voices for a new generation. NHL 15 welcomes the NBC Sports commentary team of Mike 'Doc' Emrick and Eddie Olczyk to the broadcast booth. TSN analyst Ray Ferraro will provide game insights at ice level. Combined with Real Life Broadcast Integration that will feature real-world pre-game video commentary with Doc and Eddie set against in-game visuals, NHL 15 takes a revolutionary step forward in sports videogames; where the lines between the real world of sport broadcast and the game are blurred.\n\nNBC SPORTS GAME DAY PRESENTATION\nThe most realistic broadcast package in a video game to-date is possible because of a new partnership with NBC Sports. Set the scene with the NHL on NBC crew welcoming you to the city during the game intros and immerse yourself in an experience that matches what you see on television with NHL on NBC graphics and branding.\n\nLIVING CROWDS\nNHL 15 sets a new standard in videogames with over 9,000 individual crowd models with 4x the animations of previous generations. Take a look through the glass and you’ll see fans hold up signs with your name on them, costume wearing superfans, or even sections full of team rivals rooting against you. Feel their behavior change after dropping the gloves, landing a big hit, or scoring a clutch goal. The crowd is alive.\n\nVISION AI\nAn elevated level of player intelligence, Vision AI features evolved awareness with players reading and reacting to potential plays. Scoring area recognition, pass anticipation, and enhanced team breakouts all improve the flow of the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1o2y.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EA Canada","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"EA Sports","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":1939,"name":"Destiny","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bungie has emphasized that the universe of Destiny will be \"alive\".

Instead, the game has been referred to as a \"shared-world shooter,\" as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to see and interact with all other players in the game or on a particular server—as is the case in many conventional MMO games—Destiny will include on-the-fly matchmaking that will allow players to see and interact only with other players with whom they are \"matched\" by the game.\nDestiny will incorporate a new game engine that allows global illuminations and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together.

Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game.\n\nRoad to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nThe game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition. Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure.\n\nYou will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe.

Similarly to Reborn, Pokémon Rejuvenation is not a ROM hack, but a standalone game made with RPG Maker.\n\nThe game takes place in the Aevium region, which was split into several islands after some catastrophic event in the past. The protagonist and their mother, Nancy, are headed there aboard the S.S. Oceana when it gets attacked by local villainous team Team Xen. With the ship destroyed and their mother captured, the protagonist is narrowly saved and escapes to East Gearen City — shaken, but ready to challenge the Pokémon League, take the fight to Team Xen, and hopefully, rescue their mother in the process.\n\nLike its inspiration, Pokémon Reborn, Pokémon Rejuvenation has a more mature story than mainline Pokémon games (albeit not as dark as Reborn's). It also features much more difficult encounters, with two difficulty levels available: Story and Classic. The game borrows Reborn's ideas of a field effect system, 18 Gym Leaders, and a level cap, but also replaces the traditional Elite 4 with an Elite 8 and grants new, unique moves to every gym leader. In addition, the game brings back Shadow Pokémon from Pokémon Colosseum and its sequel, now rebalanced, with Fairy-type Pokémon resisting their attacks.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5stf.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Reborn, Evolved","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Janichroma","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":24462,"name":"Touhou: Scarlet Curiosity","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Touhou Koukishin ~ Adventures of Scarlet Curiosity is a 3D RPG released on 16 August during Comiket 86.
