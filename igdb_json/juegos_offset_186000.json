A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.\n\nSpring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.\n\nLineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.\n\nFinty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.\n\nColor Collision. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time. The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.\n\nRat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.\n.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3gal.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":71066,"name":"Hot Wheels Stunt Track Driver 2: Get 'N Dirty","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripci√≥n","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6iry.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50023,"name":"Rip-Tide Racer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rip-Tide Racer is a Racing game, developed and published by Cryo Interactive, which was released in Europe in 2000.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7m9n.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":46507,"name":"Vectrace","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Weave your way through the other race cars and toward the checkered flag!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co79gz.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":37537,"name":"Vaboom!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Catch the falling bombs!

Innerhalb eines Jahres verkaufte es sich mehr als 200.000 Mal. Von den Spielemagazinen wurde es mit guten Wertungen bedacht (z. B. PC Player 87 %, Gamestar 88 %, PC Games 86 %).\nJedoch war es zu Beginn geradezu gef√ºllt mit Bugs, was von der Spielergemeinde kritisiert wurde. Dennoch wurde es von den Anstoss-Fans mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, da es die wichtigsten Elemente von Anstoss 2 Gold enthielt und diese noch weiter vertiefen konnte.\nAls besonders gelungen gilt die 3D-Spieldarstellung. Der Spieler konnte sich ein komplettes Spiel seines Teams reduziert auf neun Minuten ansehen. Auch der Szenenmodus galt als revolution√§r, da die Szenen nicht, wie in den Vorg√§ngerteilen, vorberechnet wurden. Kommentiert wurden die Spielszenen durch den bekannten Fu√üballkommentator G√ºnther Koch.\nAuch neu war die Umsetzung des Vereinsgel√§ndes. Von Apfelb√§umen √ºber Konditionsparcours und Doping-Labor bis hin zu Wolkenkratzern konnte der Spieler sein Vereinsgel√§nde mit Geb√§uden, Gegenst√§nden und Lebewesen mit und ohne Nutzen erweitern.\nMit der Ver√∂ffentlichung des finalen Patches auf Version 1.40 wurde es nahezu bugfrei und konnte die Anstoss-Spieler √ºberzeugen. Insgesamt wurden bis heute √ºber eine Million Exemplare von Anstoss 3 verkauft und machen es damit zu einem der erfolgreichsten PC-Spiele Deutschlands. Trotz seines Alters wird Anstoss 3 durch die gro√üe Spieltiefe zusammen mit einem gelungenen Text- und 3D-Modus als bester Teil der Anstoss-Reihe angesehen. Dass Anstoss 3 auch heute noch sehr beliebt ist, h√§ngt auch mit dem Multiplayermodus zusammen. So wird es bis zu 4 Spielern erm√∂glicht, im Netzwerk gegeneinander anzutreten.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ky3.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":10911,"name":"Evolva","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A game in which mankind sends its bio-engineered troops to stop a parasite race from destroying the universe. \n \nEvolva combines the excitement of a fast paced shoot-em-up with the tactical challenge of commanding a squad.

It was released in North America on May 18, 2000. It is of note that it would not be until 2006 before another AFL video game would be released. It is based around the fame of American football champion Kurt Warner. It is a modified version of NFL Blitz set in the Arena Football League. Arena ball is a version of American football played indoors on a 50 yard field with nets behind each endzone and boards on the sidelines.\n\nKurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed differs from other American football video games due to its usage of the arena football system. A few rule changes include that there are half as many players on the field, field goals go back into play if they miss the goalposts, and there's no such thing as punting. The game is compared to NFL Blitz 2000 for its violence, and one reviewer even noted that \"The post-play violence has been pumped up to the level that Blitz had before the NFL forced Midway to tone it down.\"\n\nA Dreamcast version was announced at the same time as \"Arena Football\" prior to rebranding to \"Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed\", however the Dreamcast version was cancelled for unknown reasons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xma.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":72278,"name":"Kyojin no Doshin Kaihou Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishuugou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kyojin no Doshin Kaihou Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishuugou is a game for the Nintendo 64DD, and a successor to Doshin the Giant 1.

However, this is not enough because - depending on the damage taken - it first has to be built up again. The time this takes depend on various factors, e.g. what other near targets are available, and can be sped up with supply drops by transport aircraft. Available ground installments also have other effects, e.g. the availability of ammo or troops.\n\nThe majority of of the action is fought in the air with World War II aircraft, but there are also ground (e.g. tanks) and naval vehicles available. The matches itself are of a grand scale and can take multiple hours; afterwards the map is reset. Overall the controls are somewhere between simulation and action.
