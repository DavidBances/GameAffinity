The Cat is one in a series of nine virtual pets released by Neechez Innovation Limited.\n\nAll the games play in a similar manner. When installed the player has two new programs in the Windows Start menu, hatch.exe and, with this game, pcpet.exe. All creatures are first hatched, there are nine cats to hatch but only one can be alive at a time and the game only allows the player to hatch egg number one when the game is first played.\n\nEach virtual pet needs at least ten minutes attention per day and if treated well it lives for sixty days at which point it becomes an egg again at which point a new egg is hatched and the process of training begins all over again. The game screen consists of a background around which the cat moves, in the upper left is a fish skeleton which is a hotspot for the game control menu, in the upper right is a question mark which opens the in-game help. The game control menu comprises a series of numbers and icons, the numbers show the cat's current status, some of the icons move the player from one location to another while others turn the cursor into one of the cat's toys.\n\nThe game is basic and quite easy to play, thought buttons appear over the cat's head showing whether it's hungry or wants to play. When in the kitchen the player can open a cupboard to get cat food, or they can open the fridge to get milk, to put into the feeding bowls. In the TV room the TV can be turned on to entertain the cat and if the fire is lit the cat will fall asleep in front of it. If the player is unable to play with their pet for a few days the game has a 'babysitter' function which automatically cares for the cat until the owner returns. The game also allows the player to play 'Connect 4' with their pet.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8kmv.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":310362,"name":"3D Pets: PC Pup","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"3D Pets is a game where the player takes care of a variety of different creatures.\n\nEach 3D Pet begins its life upon hatching out of an egg (yes, a dog hatches out of an egg!) and must be cared for at least 10 minutes per day. If you are unable to play with your pet there is a babysitter feature that does so until you return.\n\nPC Pup is the second half of the first volume in the series, alongside Splat! The Cat.\n\nOnce you name your pup, you are free to explore a handful of interactive rooms including a bedroom with a stereo, bathroom with medicine in case the pet gets sick, living room with a television, and a garden where your pet must be trained to 'do its business', as well as others. Little thought bubbles will appear over PC Pup's head indicating what he wants the player to give him, or how he is feeling.\n\nAt the end of the pets lifespan, you will see him shrink slowly and then be presented with an 'Angel's Certificate' with stats about the pet's care listed. You may then hatch your next pet and let the circle of life continue.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":310363,"name":"Ticket to Ride Deluxe Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8kn0.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}]},{"id":310364,"name":"Fuga: Melodies of Steel 1 & 2 - Double Pack","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A special set of both Fuga: Melodies of Steel 1 and 2 is now available!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8kn1.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":310365,"name":"Flight Attendant Simulator: Onboard Tasks","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome Aboard!
