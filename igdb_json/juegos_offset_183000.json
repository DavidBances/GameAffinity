In addition to navigating the main characters around the mansion grounds, players are able to enter Viewfinder Mode, where the camera is raised and the view changes to that of the camera's frame. In viewfinder mode the player is able to snap photographs of ghosts, both violent and benign, which is the main method of progressing through the game. Items are also available, some being consumable and most being key items needed to unlock doors, complete tasks or solve puzzles. Puzzles are encountered frequently in the game, some being based on the same concept but becoming progressively more difficult. The varying difficulty settings of the game (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Fatal (Xbox only)) determine the amount of consumable items scattered throughout the mansion and how formidable the enemies are.\n\nThe main horror aspect of the game is, undoubtedly, the ghosts. The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player. The ghosts' appearances are usually inspired by their deaths or by Japanese stigmas of horror, which, some argue, are particularily chilling.\n\nThe game, depending on which console it is played on, offers two endings. Upon completion of the game, a ranking is given based on total time taken, points accumulated and other categories. The player is also given rewards and unlockables, such as alternate costumes and camera functions, depending on what difficulty was beaten, how much of the Ghost List was completed and other criteria. Beating the game also unlocks Battle Mode, where the player is faced with fighting specific ghosts, and is rewarded with points towards purchasing unlockables.

Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but also each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.\n\nPlayers then train the monsters by choosing which foods to feed them with, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for learning new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased; more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling the bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however they do face an enforced retirement age.\n\nThere is a storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games are back, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended.\n\nThe two-player mode, requiring the link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against each other. It also allows players to trade items and cash money, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters bringing them into each others' game files.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4dut.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":6502,"name":"Magical Vacation","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Once upon a time, war erupted for three days in the magic kingdom Kovomaka.

Akin to snowboarding, the sports popularity is spreading like wildfire around the globe. Evolving from a combination of waterskiing, snowboarding, skating and surfing, wakeboarding is not only the world's fastest-growing water board sport but also the most accessible. It can be done on waterski lakes or on the sea. Riders are able to perform amazing BIG AIR tricks (Backwash, Bindings, Edge, Fakie etc), whilst being towed behind a boat, with the use of big boards and big wakes. The rider stands sideways on a shorter, wider board similar in concept to a snowboard. If you have no imagination, look at these shots from real wakeboarding (shot1, shot2, shot3). So now I think you have an idea kind of sport wakeboarding is, so back to the game. \nBig Air Wakeboarding features over eight distinct characters, hundreds of different mind-bending trick combos, multiple jumps and obstacles, real wakeboards from O'Brien, and Darin Shapiro - the 2000 X Games and Pro Wakeboard Tour Champion. In the game you can choose from Career, Competition and Quick Start. In Career mode you have to collect Gas cans, to improve your character over time.These Gas cans unlock new board graphics and improve on the quality of all boards. Gas can also unlock better boats with bigger wakes and more advanced tie-ins. In Competition you got three runs out in the open water to try and rack up the most points - any medal in a competition will unlock the next course.

You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co87sb.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Amuze","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Acclaim Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":341,"name":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first Harry Potter video game for the PlayStation, and one of several different games based on the book and movie.
