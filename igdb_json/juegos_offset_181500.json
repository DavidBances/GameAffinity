Developed by the Slovakian team Darksoft Game Development Studio and the Czech company Cinemax, Necromania challenges players to navigate labyrinthine environments and overcome various enemies and creatures to acquire fragments of a powerful magic key.\n\nThe story centers around the fallen dark lord, Ragnar, who finds himself imprisoned by the forces of the Absurdian king, Bill Cocoton. In a bid to set Ragnar free and seize control of the realm, seven of Ragnar's loyal minions awaken from their slumber, each vying to obtain the magic keys that can unlock their master's prison. However, only one of them can ultimately lead the army of darkness to victory. As players progress through the game's numerous levels, they must strategize, laying traps and leveraging the intricacies of the environments to outsmart their adversaries.\n\nWhile Necromania: Trap of Darkness received mixed reviews, critics praised its multiplayer mode, even though finding opponents proved challenging. However, the game faced criticism for its unrefined gameplay mechanics and notable difficulty. The title offered an interesting blend of puzzle-like elements and combat, with an emphasis on trap utilization rather than direct confrontation. The lack of balance among the character classes and dated visuals added to the overall underwhelming experience. Despite its attempts to innovate, Necromania: Trap of Darkness fell short of leaving a lasting impression in the gaming landscape.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6qa7.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Darksoft Game Development Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy First","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CINEMAX, s.r.o.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1329,"name":"Turok: Evolution","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Get locked and loaded in an exciting prequel to the Turok series.

As of January 2014, there have been over 41 versions and updates released, including updates to America's Army: Proving Grounds which was released in August 2013. All versions have been developed on the Unreal Engine. The game is financed by the U.S. government and distributed by free download.\n\nAccording to game historian Carrie McLeroy America's Army has \"grown in ways its originators couldn't have imagined\".[3] Dozens of government training and simulation applications using the America's Army platform have been developed to train and educate U.S. Army soldiers.[4] America's Army has also been used to deliver virtual soldiering experiences to participants at events, such as air shows, amusement parks, and sporting events around the country. The America's Army series has also been expanded to include versions for Xbox and Xbox 360, arcade, and mobile applications published through licensing arrangements.[5][6]","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7yjg.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"U.S. Army","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":23774,"name":"Endgame","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Endgame is an futuristic action light-gun shooter which has been compared to Time Crisis games.\n\nThe story is about an evil plot to use virtual reality mind-control to take over the world. The main character is Jade Cornell, a foxy redhead, whose friend Tyler has gotten too close to the truth. The game starts when Jade receives a message from him telling her where to find the gun he left in her apartment. As soon as she grabs the gun, the door bursts open .. and the first gunfight begins.\n\nThe game is played out in five fast-and-furious chapters, all of which are timed. Jade will trek through exotic European locales (including the Swiss Alps and the London Underground), shooting baddies and bosses. The faster you shoot each wave of enemies the better, as the time saved is added to the next chapter.\n\nThe environment is totally destructible. You can shoot pictures off the walls, shoot cabinets open and have glassware crash to the floor and otherwise wreck much of your surroundings. Also, you can cause explosions that will kill all the enemies in the vicinity.\n\nFinishing the game the first time unlocks additional modes of play and mini-games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1oul.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":132,"name":"Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos is an RTS made by Blizzard Entertainment.
