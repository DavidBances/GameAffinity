The bad news: Dr. Wily shows up to ruin the fun, and basically everything at the festival tries to kill our hero. Mega Man must conquer an array of eclectic challenges in order to restore peace!\n\nInspired by the Super Mario-themed Make a Good Level contests, this is the game that launched the largest and most ambitious Mega Man fangame series ever. In contrast with later installments, MaGMML1 is built in Blyka's Engine, contains a small number of contestant-submitted levels, gives the player a limited number of lives, and has relatively few extras and special features. The judging rubric, copied from Make a Good Level Contest X2, is borderline incomprehensible. The special weapons, decided by popular vote, are somewhat redundant due to how the voting was set up. Arguably the biggest distinguishing feature, however, is that the game is absolutely full of bugs.\n\nRegardless of the quirks, the game still built the foundation for the bigger and more polished games that followed it. Five people judge levels based on certain criteria, levels are placed into tiers, Wily levels are made by the judges, and everything is compiled into a big game in the end. On top of that, the game is full of humor (intentional and otherwise), and there are several memorable (and infamous) levels that any fan of the series should experience at least once. History must be preserved!

Battles are a mix of turn-based strategy puzzles on a set map with enemies that can move about, random item nodes and heliports/command nodes, from which the player can summon their own echelons, or support echelons, which are echelons that the player's friend sets on their profile to be used by others, and real-time battles with enemy echelons. Battles are for the most part automated, although the player can activate the T-Dolls' special abilities manually if wanted, or order them to different spots in formation (which the player can organise out of battle to be set as the default formation when entering a battle) or to withdraw in order to conserve health or resources). Players also have the option of withdrawing specific echelons from the mission altogether if they wish. Gameplay progresses by playing on the campaign missions, logistic support missions, or combat simulations to level up each T-Doll. The game also features gacha elements, such as in the production and heavy production of T-Dolls and equipment, or in the Dormitory with costumes and furniture sets for the T-Dolls on a time-limited basis with several sets and costumes being available for a limited time, before another few sets and costumes are revealed and added. After a while, old costumes from previous gacha events will be added to the \"Black Card\" store, where players can exchange an amount of Black Cards (obtained from gifting T-Dolls a duplicate costume that has already been gifted before) for a costume of a previous gacha set. Players can customise their dorms with furniture, and interact with Chibi renditions of the T-Dolls in the echelon corresponding with that dorm. They can also gift the T-Dolls food and costume, which raises the affection of the T-Dolls. Affection is also gained from success in battle, and is lost when the T-Dolls die (unless it is a boss battle) or when another T-Doll in the same echelon dies.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co97oy.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Digital Sky","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MICA TEAM","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SUNBORN Network","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":57723,"name":"Mystery Trackers: Winterpoint Tragedy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"Winterpoint Tragedy\" has the player following the distress call of an Alaskan research team, whose latest discovery threatens the world.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8njf.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Elephant Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Big Fish Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":34648,"name":"Systematic Immunity","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Systematic Immunity is a challenging precision platformer set inside the human body...and not a particularly healthy one either.

Players have to focus not only on their defense, but also on their offense if they want to improve their chances of winning. The player's offense is determined by which key or button the player presses while a ball is colliding with their paddle. This gives the player more control over which hitting techniques they use in different situations during the game. The versatile controls in this game allow the player to control the offense in a variety of both familiar and unfamiliar ways. Players can choose and change up their controls on the fly by deciding which combination of keys or buttons they want to use in real-time.\n\nWith the exception of the Classic Pong game event, all of the rest of the game events in this game requires the player to focus their defense and offense on 2 balls during gameplay instead of just one. This can create situations where the player can be on offense and defense at the same time, and it can also create situations where the player might be temporarily overwhelmed by 2 balls moving towards their side of the screen at the same time; which can possibly become more difficult to deal with depending on whether or not certain ball collisions happen during these situations. There are 16 possible ball collisions that can happen when the 2 balls collide with each other. These possible ball collisions are determined by which direction the 2 balls are moving in, and also what speed the 2 balls are moving at when they collide with each other. There are also other possible collisions that can happen (even during the Classic Pong game event) when a ball collides with a paddle; which can either result in the ball \"staying in play\" or \"going out of play\". Players will only be able to use their offense on a ball if it stays in play.\n\nThe AI will adapt to the player's skill level based on how well the player is performing in the game. Although the AI can adapt to the player's skill level, the AI will never become unbeatable. The player just needs to figure out a way to beat the AI. If the player figures out a way to beat the AI in each of the game events, they can choose to play against other players who have done the same in order to find their next level of challenge. The AI in this game is smart and was designed to have a similar play style to some of the players. The AI is also capable of making split decisions when necessary. In addition to a smart and adaptive AI, this game also has some hidden in-game strategies and easter eggs; but I want the players to discover them on their own.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co29sa.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":111196,"name":"King Rabbit: Puzzle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A puzzle-sandbox with over 50,000 levels, a level builder, and a player-driven economy.\nPart puzzler, platformer, level builder.
