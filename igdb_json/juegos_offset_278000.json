This process combines Oblivion’s impressive award-winning open-world that is renowned for its incredible gameplay, memorable quests, and expansive world space with the advancements in gaming that have been made in the last two decades. Set in the Elder Scroll’s Third Era, during the cataclysmic Oblivion Crisis, you must help to restore the Imperial throne and repel the demonic Daedric invasion.\n\nSkyblivion will feature the remastered entirety of Oblivion’s mainland, Cyrodiil, from the wintery slopes of the Valus and Jerall Mountains to the swamps of Blackwood and warm-beachy shores of the Gold Coast. Skyblivion will bring the return of many classic Oblivion mechanics like spell crafting, a complete class and attributes system, underwater combat, and NPC disposition.\n\nIn addition to recreating Oblivion’s systems and porting them into the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim’s engine the project has taken great care in providing new improvements and additions. Skyblivion offers fans remastered graphics, weather, and lighting, an expanded soundtrack, new gameplay mechanics, and even a limited selection of bespoke minor quests with original voice acting to further flesh out barren areas of Oblivion—all for free!\n\nOnce Skyblivion is released in 2025, fans will have access to the entirety of Oblivion’s pre-DLC world space, systems, and quests available for play. But that’s not the end of the project! Following a period of bug-fixing and community-supported updates the project development team will move on to working on Oblivion’s nine additional content releases plus the Shivering Isles expansion.\n\nWith Skyblivion you experience the best of both worlds: The complex and detailed RPG experience of Oblivion paired with Skyrim’s newer systems, graphics, and quality of life improvements.

After spending all day yesterday putting up posters he has found out that his rival, Nasty Norville has messed them up. You play as Pat as he attempts to put the posters back to normal within a time limit. Before you play the game you can select which level to play from a choice of 12. These are split into three groups which are Kids Stuff, Smart Alec and Mensa Only and each level is harder than the last one but with a higher time limit. The first poster is just a grid of 2x2 while the last poster is 8x8 and when one is completed you see a tick beside the level you have completed. You can attempt any level at any time and if you fail one then you can attempt it again later.\n\nThe game is viewed from behind Pat on his ladder with a small part of the poster shown and the screen scrolls when you move Pat in multiple directions. With your brush you slide the pieces of the poster by a full row or a full column so forward planning is required. In the bottom right corner is a sign for the toilet and if you press down you can see what the poster should look like, a press of the fire button shows the poster with the grid on it and finally another press of the fire button and you see what the poster is looking like at that moment. As you move the pieces around the screen you have to avoid missiles being thrown at you by Norville's henchmen and if you are hit by one you lose one of five lives. Failing to complete the level within the time limit and you fail the level and back to the level select screen.

It can be played with either a rotary controller (such as Chaos Reins, Tyrant or Jonathan Ascough pad) or a regular Jaguar joypad.\n\nXu’s United Nations Tetrad are under simultaneous attack from The Ebil Alliance. All that stands between TEA and the XUNTS is you and your warpships. You are the only officer capable of piloting these ships and are therefore the last hope of all XUNT-kind.\n\nAs your prototype warpships do not come fitted with stabilising or reverse thrusters, your ship tears around the upper atmosphere with regular engines at full output. Your task is to steer the warpship, avoid collisions and kill the attacking drones. Once the required number of drones have been dispatched, their mothership will arrive and attempt to seek revenge. Defeat this mothership and you’ll charge your warp engines and be off to the next planet where you’ll find new drones are on the attack.\n\nSome drones have taken your fellow XUNTs hostage – you are able to rescue these falling hostages by catching them with your ship, but beware – if you destroy their baloonachutes they’ll fall much more quickly. Chain hostage rescues for increased bonuses, lose a warpship and the chain will reset.\n\nAs you defeat drones, your allies below collect their wreckage, recycle it and construct further warpships for your use. 1st extra warpship at 20,000 and every 50,000 afterwards. Lose a warpship and your allies will transport a new one to your position.

(Progressive Game Distributors) in April 1985; it was the last game to run on the altered version of Taito's Qix hardware first used for Space Dungeon, The Electric Yo-Yo, Kram, and Zoo Keeper (two Motorola M6809s run at 1.25 MHz and a Motorola M6802 run at 921.6 KHz, with an added Motorola M68705 run at 1 MHz). The game was originally going to be released by Taito America, but the company never released it because they closed down their manufacturing plant in September 1984. However, the game still credits Taito America and has a 1984 copyright date on the title screen. The player must use two eight-way joysticks (one for moving and one for firing) to take control of a nuclear scientist whose objective is to escape from a flooding reactor as the water's level rises below him before running out of air (which is indicated by the \"AIR LEFT\" meter at the top of the screen) - and every blue-and-magenta square he collects shall add ten shots to his reserve (indicated by the number above the \"AIR LEFT\" meter that starts at 50 for every level), which he must use to shoot creatures that block his progress. Like Mario and Luigi in Mario Bros., the scientist may also disappear off one side of the screen and reappear on the other, but to make him jump, the player needs to push a button on top of the \"firing\" joystick (and good timing is essential for reaching the moving, magenta platforms); furthermore, once the scientist reaches the level's exit, he will receive a bonus of 100 points for every shot remaining in his reserve.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co88ck.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":301912,"name":"Downward: Enhanced Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Enjoy the best version of Downward, with improved graphics and new assets...
