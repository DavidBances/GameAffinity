The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance, they will be more and more dynamic and varied.\nFor example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles.\nThe real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the \"\"gold chip\"\" of that particular level.\nThe \"\"gold chip\"\" will be used to unlock new skins for our robot.

This is obtained from fights, but also helping many of the Bots doing several missions. He can fight in groups to share the experience of a difficult fight, although a senior level, players are often organized in clans to communicate better and help, establish a uniform etc.\n\nThe character has a set of skills depending on the chosen crime. Some of them require that the character and his training have reached a certain level of experience. He can also try to steal items from action bots. When caught, a fight can be started, but also at any given moment with another character.\n\nAs in other games, there are several trade skills, here for instance by going to the kitchen and combining objects in the oven, or finding books in libraries to learn recipes, concepts of mechanics, the art of chemical or sewing.

The basement smells kind of funny and it's really hazy down there, but it should be okay for now. There's a big fuel tank outside where you can refill your jerry can, and dad refilled it before he left. There's also a big pile of wooden boards out front from when your dad renovated the barn over the summer, so you can use those to board up the windows just in case.\n\nThe storm should be here soon and you're as prepared as you can be, but still you feel uneasy; something's not quite right... you feel as if something's lurking out there, watching.\n\nYour goal is to survive three nights of the Thing trying to force its way into your home, by barricading doors and windows. The thing really doesn't like light, so you can drive it away with your rechargeable flashlight. You can also \"reinforce\" parts of the house by turning lights on, which will slow the thing's attacks at the cost of draining more power and needing to refill the generator more frequently.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5ozy.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Two Glass Hams","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":221751,"name":"Machine Gun Mages","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Battle through hell using your powerful magic and trusty sidearm to fight off endless demons.
