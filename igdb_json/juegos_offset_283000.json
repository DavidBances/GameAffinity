Firing at 600 rounds-per-minute, the Gustav provides accurate single shots, whilst also offering great control in continuous fire.\n\nA powerful pump-action shotgun, the Trench Gun first saw use by US Forces during World Wars I & II. Fed with 12-gauge shells from its 6-round tube magazine, it sacrifices range and fire rate for extreme damage in close quarters.\n\nThe Double 1866 is a double-barrel pocket pistol designed in the 19th Century as an easily concealable backup gun that can be drawn at speed. Despite only featuring a single-action trigger and producing a very low muzzle velocity, the D.1866's unique traits make for a powerful weapon at close range.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8fbw.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":307284,"name":"Sniper Elite 5: Death From Above Weapon and Skin Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Death From Above is the second content pack in Season Pass Two bringing a new rifle in the shape of the Pedersen, a weapon skin and two character skins.\n\nThe Pedersen rifle was proposed as part of a program to adopt a semi-automatic replacement to the M1903.

The British Bomber skin for Karl gives him a distinct aviator look while the Air Auxiliary skin for Monika reflects the uniforms worn by the women’s air-corps whose job was to transport new or repaired planes to active military airfields throughout the UK.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8fbx.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":307285,"name":"Sniper Elite 5: Saboteur Weapon and Skin Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Two new weapons and a Liberator character skin for Karl await in the latest content drop from Season Pass Two.\n\nBoth the Grease Gun and TERA rifle are now available as part of your arsenal.

With low levels of recoil, it provides both accuracy and a rapid rate of fire in the right hands.\n\nDesigned to be a light, reliable and mass-produced weapon, the Grease Gun is an SMG with great mobility that is very easy to control, even under sustained firing, thanks to its low rate of fire and recoil. Despite its low muzzle velocity, the stability and control on offer make it a solid choice for slightly longer ranged combat encounters.\n\nFinally, the Liberator Skin celebrates the liberation of Paris.

Others seek to bring popular movies to Half-Life in order to replicate the feeling of the movie in a game. Still others evoke fear and revulsion with a dark, gloomy feel. And then you have mods that make you laugh your ass off. Rocket Crowbar is of the latter type, and one of the best out there right now. If you're looking for wacky fun, Rocket Crowbar delivers. In spades.\n\nRocket Crowbar is basically a weapons modification mod, but the new HL 1.1-compatible version has a couple of extra tricks up its sleeve. First of all, the server can enable a CTF mode on any deathmatch level. All you have to do is make sure teamplay is on and that at least two teams are listed in the server options. Best of all, you can have up to six teams for some really chaotic fun. Secondly, the mod includes the option of a little pregame poll. The person hosting the server just has to edit the appropriate text files in the mod directory and activate the poll via a console command (see below). There is also a very basic bot included, if you're really short on people to kill. All right, you say. Enough with the extra stuff; let's see the weapons!\n\nAll of the Rocket Crowbar weapons have different effects than the standard Half-Life ones. Most notable is the secondary fire on the crowbar, which fires a rocket (and thus, the name of the mod). Weapon balance is taken up a bit in Rocket Crowbar; many weapons are quite lethal. If you're the type who's used to shrugging off a few hits and only trying to dodge shots from big weapons, you're in for a rude awakening. Fortunately, the \"drunken rocket\" effect helps to offset the crowbar as a major weapon. I won't list all of the new effects here, as there is fun to be had in discovering what things do. The Glock has a secondary fire that will push you a little in the direction you're facing. This lets you boost yourself to higher places without the complete mobility provided by the usual grappling hooks, which is a nice balancer. Another example of a highly lethal but fairly balanced weapon is the \"gravity well\" hand grenade. The effect is quite spectacular, but it's easy to get hoist with your own petard when using them. The rocket launcher throws out a friendly NPC, which is actually a very powerful proximity mine. Other effects include the shotgun firing a flying scientist, snarks with eye lasers (and the ability to look through the snarks' eyes) and the tau cannon's teleport effect.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8qcc.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Laser","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":307354,"name":"Bart Bash","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Click all the Barts!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ih0.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":307355,"name":"Neon Genesis Evitalian","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Relive the story of Neon Genesis Evangelion in the world of the Mushroom Kingdom.
