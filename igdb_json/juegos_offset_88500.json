You’ll climb through dark tunnels to reach mystical mountain temples. You’ll match wits with goblins, ghosts and sentient coffeemakers. You might even save the world from tearing itself apart. \n \nAll you need to get this quest started? A magical phone. Be sure to read the fine print. \n \nThis is Guildlings, a new story-driven episodic adventure brought to you by Asher Vollmer (maker of Threes), IGF award-winner Jamie Antonisse, and the team of dedicated indies at Sirvo Studios. Drawing inspiration from classic RPGs, point and click puzzlers and visual novel games, it tells a lighthearted coming-of-age fantasy tale within a modern mobile frame. \n \nFeatures: \n- Traverse hand-crafted low-poly environments, including floating ruins, a tavern built from a shipwrecked boat, and the mountaintop teen hangout known as “Makeout Temple”. \n- Use a text-message inspired chat system to make conversations and choices. Characters will react to your decisions in satisfying (and sometimes hilarious) ways. \n- Leverage your Guild members’ abilities in playful turn-based combat. Each Guildling has a unique set of powers tied to their personality. \n- Affect the world around you through your Guildmaster magic. A single touch can unlock doors, open treasure chests, or even blow up your dad’s favorite lamp. \n- Guildlings’ magic powers are tied to their moods. This system ties conversation, exploration and combat together. Keeping your team happy will make your journey easier, but sometimes a little drama will take the story to interesting places… \n \nIf you’ve read this far already, what are you waiting for? Boot up your Tome, meet your new best friends, and become their Guildmaster. Worldaria awaits.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tskhzh1z32er6c1q4jdg.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sirvo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":96258,"name":"Planet Runners","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"PLANET RUNNERS is an Online Multiplayer Platformer Racing game with ultra mega simple controls and an unforgiving soundtrack.\"","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1w6o.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Happy Doze","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":96259,"name":"Hell, the Dungeon Again!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Make the way through the dungeons full of terrible monsters and fight with the chief demon, gave birth to hordes of evil creeps.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":96260,"name":"Flow Free: Hexes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hexes!

This package includes an AI module that modifies livestock DNA to generate edible lifeforms that area ideal to the planet conditions allowing you to focus efforts on terraforming and construction. Your settlement progress has been spectacular, and although you're nearing retirement, you've managed to expand the colony from its meager initial size of 100 adult citizens in a valley, to over 1,000 residents of all ages spread over several outposts during your tenure. \n \nUnfortunately, the 'Sustenance and Nutrient Generator' you were given seems to be malfunctioning, as the animals being created have recently exhibited violent behaviour and are now chasing down your people as they flee to the founding settlement. You need to set up defenses to slow the tide of violent animals, while you begin a search for a lasting solution. \n \nThis game is a unique fusion of tower defense strategy and visual novel, with branching dialogue and four different endings. As you play, the AI uses machine learning to discover what offense is the best against specific defenses. It takes into account the pathing, water hazards, and even the genetics of the animals which it controls indirectly by selecting the best specimens from its own evolving evaluation.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nie18l93l34wyo0bowdj.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cabrill Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":96391,"name":"Shenmue I & II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"Originally released for the Dreamcast in 2000 and 2001, Shenmue I & II is an open world action adventure combining jujitsu combat, investigative sleuthing, RPG elements, and memorable mini-games.
