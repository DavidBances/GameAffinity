Only USCF Chess had been approved for onboard RAM, an expensive proposition.\n\nWhen the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) was given the green light, Gabriel Baum, VP of Applications Software, proposed changing Land Battle to an ECS title; the ECS had an additional 2K of RAM available for cartridges. Marketing resisted this -- they still wanted Land Battle as a stand-alone game. Peggi Decarli was assigned to give the game a graphics makeover.\n\nAfter the makeover, Marketing still didn't find it visually interesting enough. By that time, wargame fanatic Steve Sents, having completed Deadly Discs, had started work on an ECS wargame called Desert Fox, which Marketing liked the looks of better. The decision was made to kill Land Battle and incorporate as much of its gameplay and programming as possible into the Desert Fox design.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ph2.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Intellivision"}]},{"id":41441,"name":"Brickout!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"[Unreleased 1981] \n \nGAME DESCRIPTION \nUse your paddle to bounce a ball against descending rows of colored bricks.

For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion...\n\nThe game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two Langrisser games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to Ultima games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own \"judgment\" ability\"; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn.\n\nThe story of Langrisser V is closely connected to the one told in Langrisser IV - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe.\n\nThe game's plot revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard...\n\nLangrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\". Like in Langrisser III, there is an element of \"love simulation\" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yys.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":28138,"name":"Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The only Hyper Neo Geo 64 game to be ported to another system.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2eo3.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Hyper Neo Geo 64"}]},{"id":25094,"name":"iS: internal section","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"iS: internal section (イズ ～インターナル・セクション～?) is a video game developed by Positron and published by Square and released in 1999.

The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested.

This led to increased border tensions, and soon small regional wars turned into a Global War, where all kinds of weapons were used, killing millions and destroying vast amounts of knowledge. As the use of nuclear weapons rendered many oil fields useless due to radiation, mankind had to turn away from fossil fuels, and eventually outlawed their use and turn to clean energy sources. \n \nDuring the war, China had broken up into several independent states, but thanks to their reliance in both old and new technologies, they bounced back, and under the hand of Emperor Zindo reunited, and went to control most of Asia. The United States, while had their population devastated, managed to hold their infrastructures and technology mostly intact, and had Mexico and Canada joining as new states, as well as a change in the constitution that changed the government into a private company, with certain special citizens being considered \"shareholders\". \n \nDue to the limitations of non-fossil energy sources, the control of a recently discovered material (Thermodux) that could amplify the power output of those energy sources is highly coveted. So, after an accident that killed the researchers and completing an hostile take-over of India Incorporated, Zendo announced a \"security attachment\" to \"protect\" the Solomon Islands (where Thermodux was being studied) from further terrorist threat. However, The US contracted a mercenary company, Navco, to clear the island, with the player joining as new recruit for the company, working for cash and shares in the US government. \n \nThe game is a typical flight combat simulator, with missions involving patrol, defense and attacking enemy facilities. The ultimate goal of the game is to survive each mission, taking down as many enemy aircraft as possible to collect a bounty, that can be used to purchase better weaponry and new crafts.

The mission of the game is to rescue Musashi's love Otsu from a clan of evil ninja led by Kojiro Sasaki. Players are armed with a sword (katana for Musashi/kaiken for Suzume) and a grappling claw. The claw serves as a long-range weapon, and can act as a grapnel in certain settings to reach higher ground or ascend over chasms. A powerful projectile attack can also be achieved by holding down the attack button, although this takes time to charge. Additional temporary weapons can be found throughout the game, such as shuriken for Musashi, kunai for Suzume, and an \"energy ball\" weapon.
