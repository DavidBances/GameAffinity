Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pre.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tec Toy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Psygnosis","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Malibu Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Imagesoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Playtronic","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Game Gear"},{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":5371,"name":"Cobra Command","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Terrorists are threatening the Free World and have amassed a diabolical force.

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\n\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.\n\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dp8.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Coconuts Japan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SCi Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":5398,"name":"Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters is a 1994 arcade and prequel to the original Lethal Enforcers.

While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%.

Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.\n\nPopulous: The Beginning was the first entry in the series to use true 3D computer graphics; Bullfrog waited four years after Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods so that the graphics technology could catch up to their vision for a new and different game in the series. The developers considered the addition of terrain deformation and manipulation, combined with \"smart\" villagers who automatically attended to tasks, to add an entirely new dimension to the series. The game's original title was Populous: The Third Coming before being changed prior to the beta release.\nPopulous: The Beginning plays very differently from earlier titles and received mixed reviews. Reviewers positively noted the excellent graphics, while complaints were directed at the artificial intelligence and the indecision in game design between being a real time strategy title and a god game.

The game was published by Microsoft.\n\nThe game was free-to-play—it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, the game premiered on Steam after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the Celtic civilization. On June 15, 2012 the premium content system was changed to offer the option to purchase all past and future content through \"Empire points\" earned in game, or by purchasing the points directly with real world money.\n\nAs of January 3, 2013, Microsoft ceased further development on the game. A Microsoft representative later announced on the forums that on August 22, 2013, the Games for Windows – Live Marketplace would be shut down, leaving the game only accessible by current or former players. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014 when the service would be shut down. The closure was due to the content being too expensive to maintain.\n\nIn 2017, Age of Empires Online was reestablished using Microsoft's publicly released developer-kit for the game and is now hosted on a server emulator known as \"Project Celeste\". The game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft's unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed.

It was a spin-off from the Legacy of Kain series of action-adventure games, and took place in its eponymous fictional universe. Nosgoth employed a player versus player system in which each match consisted of two rounds. Teams were composed of characters assigned to one of two races: vampires, designed around hack and slash combat; and humans, whose gameplay was styled after third-person shooters. Between rounds, teams would switch to control the opposing race, and the team which accumulated the most points by fighting their counterparts won the match.\n\nInitially announced in June 2013 following internet leaks, Nosgoth was the first Legacy of Kain-associated game to debut in almost ten years, preceded by 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Though once intended for release as part of a single-player project, Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun, it was reconceptualized and continued development as a standalone title following Dead Sun's cancellation. When officially revealed in September 2013, Nosgoth attracted negative reception for its conceptual departure from the traditional single-player and story-driven Legacy of Kain formula. Initially beginning its closed alpha and opening up its servers to registered players in late 2013, the game's open beta began in January 2015 and ended in May 2016.\n\nOn April 8, 2016, Square Enix Europe announced that Nosgoth's servers would shut down on May 31, 2016.

Each costume that comes to life provides its own unique set of superpowers that players will need to battle Halloween's worst monsters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2eiv.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"icculus.org","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Double Fine Productions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nordic Games Publishing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Other Ocean Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Humble Bundle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Junglevision Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The Adventure Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":5638,"name":"Costume Quest 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In developer Double Fine’s triumphant return to Auburn Pines, our candy-crazed crusaders Wren and Reynold must once again protect Halloween from untold horrors, and grown-ups!

Gameplay is 4X-based (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate) where players explore the world map, slowly building an empire through colonization, warfare and diplomacy with rival powers. However new to III is the greater addition of role-playing game features, where players must first choose and customize their leader, all options dependant on the player's chosen style of play. There are six available races in the initial release: humans, draconians, high elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins, all that will determine the race of their empire with each having unique perks and abilities. The leader and empire is further shaped by the choice from skill sets based on traditional RPG classes along with further specializations and skills to select. Each leader class also has access to their own unique units with a distinct visual look based on their corresponding race, each to accommodate their own unique approach to strategy, both in combat and when managing their empire. On release there are six different classes a leader can be. The \"Sorcerer\" class emphasizes the use of magic for enchantments and summoning powerful units. The \"Theocrat\" derives from an organized religion based society including zealots followers and the use of holy spells and warriors. The \"Rogue\" favors less direct approaches to situations, employing stealth, thievery and manipulation aswell as dark magic in diplomacy and warfare. The \"Archdruid\" channels the power of nature, using it to their advantage by being very self-sufficient and being able to call upon wild creatures. The \"Dreadnaught\" leads a steampunk styled society, using large industry, machinery and gunpowder-based units like cannons and tanks. Finally the \"Warlord\" specializes in direct conflict and combat tactics, utilizing effective non-magic based units and abilities.\nLeaders themselves and separate recruitable hero units will be able to gain experience and level up, while also being able to gain new equipment and powers. Players can also develop their alignment between good and evil based on their player's actions and the cultures the player absorbs into their empire, rather than race like the previous games in the series.\nCities themselves provide much of the resources, infrastructure and host to unit recruitment. Independent cities and units not immediately aligned to any player/leader are also present in the world map. Units that come from an unaffiliated city will fight to protect a city's domain, and they won't forget that they're tied to it. Many of these independent settlements aren't cities in the traditional sense, but can be alternative settlements, like a \"Giant's Keep\" for example. The player can conquer these holdings, which will provide units like a city, or they can absorb them through diplomatic means by paying tribute and diplomatic and/or alignment standing. Quests can also be given to players by independent forces and cities, including but not limited to clearing out wild units, searching for relics and even conquering cities and other holdings. Quests can grant the support of independent forces for player in addition to a reward such as gold or equipment, sometimes with the choice of either given to the player upon completion of the quest.\nAs in the case of the first game in the series, Age of Wonders III offers a story-driven campaign that is playable from two sides, the human-centric Commonwealth Empire and the Court of the High Elves. In addition to the campaign; single-player scenarios, online multiplayer, random map generation and a map editor are also available. The graphics of Age of Wonders III will be presented in 3D instead of the isometric view the series has utilized up to this point.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rbq.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Triumph Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":5653,"name":"ABPA Backgammon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Intellivision Backgammon is identical with the board game.

In either case, players are equipped with the tools of their respective trades; cops can make use of their superior training with firearms or call for helicopter air support, while gang members can choose from a wider selection of weapons and use civilian hostages as human shields.\n\nThe game was built with online play in mind, and several multiplayer modes are supported. Players can customize their characters with tattoos, brand-name apparel, and other accessories, then take them online to join others for team deathmatch-style competition. A full-fledged single-player campaign is also included, casting players in the role of an urban up-and-comer who finds trouble on both sides of the thin blue line. The plot of the single-player game was written by P. Frank Williams, known for his successes as an author, magazine editor, and television producer.
