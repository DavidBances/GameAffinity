One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls. \n \nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you. There's just one solution: set sail for Westgate and discover the secret of the Night Masks in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate. \n \nNeverwinter Nights 2: Complete is an epic RPG set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular campaign settings of Dungeons & Dragons.

All that stands between TEA and the XUNTS is you and your warpships. You are the only officer capable of piloting these ships and are therefore the last hope of all XUNT-kind.\n\nAs your prototype warpships do not come fitted with stabilising or reverse thrusters, your ship tears around the upper atmosphere with regular engines at full output. Your task is to steer the warpship, avoid collisions and kill the attacking drones. Once the required number of drones have been dispatched, their mothership will arrive and attempt to seek revenge. Defeat this mothership and you’ll charge your warp engines and be off to the next planet where you’ll find new drones are on the attack.\n\nSome drones have taken your fellow XUNTs hostage – you are able to rescue these falling hostages by catching them with your ship, but beware – if you destroy their baloonachutes they’ll fall much more quickly. Chain hostage rescues for increased bonuses, lose a warpship and the chain will reset.\n\nAs you defeat drones, your allies below collect their wreckage, recycle it and construct further warpships for your use. 1st extra warpship at 20,000 and every 50,000 afterwards. Lose a warpship and your allies will transport a new one to your position.
