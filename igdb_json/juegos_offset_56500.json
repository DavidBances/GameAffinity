Having excelled in manipulating magic (rune) in combat using her life force and living in secret from society, Freya was the only girl who has shown excellent results as a knight.\n\nFreya was summoned to the island of eternal summer, where she was born and raised, by Julius, Seventh Chord's commander and her elder brother who she reunited with after being separated for a long time, for her first mission. And that mission, was said to have never been accomplished in history; it was to “defeat a mythical god”. Although it was handed down as a legend before, the \"God\" that was subdued was revived in this present day and age once again.\n\nAfter analyzing the \"abilities\" of these mythical gods, the organization created the “strategic creation technology weapon” to fight against them. This ultimate scientific weapon, known as “Miracle”, was handed down to Freya, to challenge these mythical existences to a fight.\n\nThe enemies have transcended human intelligence, and their immortal existence has the ability to recreate the \"powers\" of a mythical god. The seven “Mahoutsukai”.\nThe seven people who gathered in the name of justice. The \"Kisekitsukai\" of the “Seventh Chord”.\n\nUltimate Science (justice) vs. Mythical Magic (another justice)\nA fight that no one had expected. Before long, the truth will begin to lead one to a sad fate.\nMission Rank: SSS-Class.\nThe seven knights were gathered to cut open the impossible fate, and set foot into the unexplored stage of humanity that will slowly become a holy war.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fd5.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"La'Cryma","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"5pb.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":61273,"name":"Sora Yume","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sora Yume is a visual novel released in 2008.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21vx.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Takuyo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":61274,"name":"Goes!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An otome game for the PlayStation Vita, about a group of students at a magic user's academy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5r8g.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Yash Future Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Petit Reve","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":61275,"name":"Soukai Buccaneers!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rian Lawrence is a 16-year-old girl whose mother passed away when she was a child and now her father has gone missing.
