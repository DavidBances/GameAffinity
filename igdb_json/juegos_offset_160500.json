While practising a particularly tricky juggling move, he accidentally taints a barrel of rum with tobacco, creating a potent and addictive brew which he coins ‘Jolly Rover’, one of the most prized substances in the Caribbean.\n\nAlas, the wealth of Jolly Rover sales only manages to fill the pockets of his uncle, and Gaius longs for action and adventure and, more importantly, the opportunity to start his own circus and follow in the footsteps of his father.\n\nIt is not long before the fumbled juggling ball of opportunity raps Gaius smartly on the head yet again. While his uncle is away, a large contract for Jolly Rover arrives from Guy DeSilver, Governor of the notorious Groggy Island, with payment upfront.\n\nIn a blinding flurry of optimism, Gaius pools his meagre savings with this advance and charters a ship and crew to take him to Groggy Island. Along the way he meets a colourful band of seafaring cutthroats, scallywags and rogues otherwise known as pirates.\n\nIt is here we begin to follow the short and stubby tail of Gaius across three wild and untamed tropical islands, as he attempts to fulfil his dream of starting a circus, hampered only by pirates, villains, voodoo, love and considerable lack of loot.\n\nJolly Rover is a traditional 2D point and click adventure, including casual elements, such as an integrated hint system, and task bar.

Puzzles images included in the game come from eight different regions, as well as eight different sizes, making piecing images together more and more challenging as familiarity with regions fade and the dimensions of puzzles change. Players can solve the puzzles alone or with a friend via a wireless connection, and for those needing an occasional break from jigsaw play, there are three additional mini-games included in the game. Finally, DSi owners can take the game to a whole new level as they are able to snap photos and create their own personalized jigsaw puzzles out of the imported images.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7693.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":209583,"name":"Future Fight","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7yri.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bloober Team","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":196221,"name":"Wonderland Days Sim Date","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wonderland Days Sim Date is a free online dating simulation by Pacthesis, released March 30, 2010.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4mgs.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Pacthesis","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":25270,"name":"Caroline's Garden","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Caroline's Garden is a story driven game in which Nano, a young gardener, has to help Caroline to grow the most beautiful flowers and sell them for a profit.

Electronic Arts’ award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series’ history.\n\nIt is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI’s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.\n\nAfter 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world’s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.\n\nWith a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20kb.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EA Los Angeles","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":499,"name":"God of War III","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Set in the realm of brutal Greek mythology, God of War III is a single-player game that allows players to take on the climatic role of the ex-Spartan warrior, Kratos, as he scales through the intimidating heights of Mt.
