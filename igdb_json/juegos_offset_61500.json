The sequel is set in a Japanese southern coastal town on the tropical Izu Peninsula where his aunt and uncle have a bed and breakfast.\n\nThe game consists of fixed screen, pre-rendered environments with 3D models and a cinematic camera with a different viewpoint for each scene. Boku's vacation only lasts 31 days, but the player is free to choose how to spend his time as it is presented as a sandbox environment. It is possible to seek quests and help the people in town to solve their problems, but he can also choose to ride his bike anywhere, go bughunting, spend time fishing, dive into the ocean, launch a rocket, go on walk, play hide and seek, or play a mini-game of beetle wrestling. Many scenes offer interaction for the sake of exploration, with no further purpose.

The main goal in the maze mini-games is to get to the flag, but each mini-game involves a different way to do so. One is simple movement, one is following arrows, one is a specifically colored path, one involves picking up all the fish food before reaching the flag, and one has X or O spaces on the maze. There are two different puzzles to choose from; a slide puzzle and a jigsaw puzzle. There are bad penguins that should be avoided in both puzzles. There are 4 different matching/memory games to choose from. One is simply matching fish, one is remembering the correct pathways by color, one has you turn the pages of the book to find an object, and one has you match the colored shapes in order. There are 2-3 difficulty levels depending on the mini-game, and it primarily focuses on teaching problem-solving and logic skills.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3zgp.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Pico"}]},{"id":66855,"name":"The Muppets on the Go","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Muppets On The Go! is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Climax and published by Sega, which was released in 1996.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3zhf.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Climax Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Pico"}]},{"id":66856,"name":"Arrow Run","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An Xbox Live Indie game developed by Silver Dollar Games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/y0dowzwnhokrquyewow5.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":66857,"name":"Roxie's Reading Fish","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A childrens game developed by LatticeWorks Software which can be used to teach basic, common English in the style of the game 'Go fish!'.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/yocgm9nb8wnarwhnbfhe.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":66858,"name":"Run and Gun","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Arcade basketball game similar to NBA Jam.
