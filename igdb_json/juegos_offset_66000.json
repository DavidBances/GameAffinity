This version of solitaire is what generally is called Windows Solitaire, or what some people think Solitaire just is as a general term (when the truth is that Solitaire is a huge genre of games just as wide as FPS is).\n\nBig Klondike features 1 Draw, 3 Draw, Random shuffles and Winnable shuffles. You can choose to have the Timer enabled or not if you prefer a relaxing experience.\n\nOur Winnable shuffles are originally Random shuffles which our custom coded solitaire bot has play tested to ensure is actually possible. We ship the game with 50,000 known Winnable shuffles for both 1 Draw and 3 Draw variations. The 1.0.0 version of our solitaire bot was made to not be too incredibly clever, so all Winnable shuffles are guaranteed to be possible below 200 moves. Though a Winnable game is guaranteed to be possible, that does not mean you will always win it first time as sometimes moves can be made in ways where the game becomes bricked - impossible to finish in that state. If that happens you can Retry that same game and go for different moves to beat it!\n\nIn Big Klondike, cards can be dragged or clicked to move them to possible moves.

The Light family has set sail on a luxury cruise ship, the SS Elroy! Unfortunately, it seems an up-and-coming group of ne'er-do-wells has set their sights on the same cruise. Before long, it's up to Mega Man to blast through the cruise's Simulation Fair in an effort to gather enough Energy Elements to save the day!\n\nMake a Good 48 Hour Mega Man Level (MaG48HMML, or just 48H) was held to test and refine the Megamix Engine in preparation for MaGMML3. Participants had 48 hours to create a level using randomly selected enemies and gimmicks from across the entire Classic Mega Man series. Levels were evaluated and ranked by a panel of 4 judges, and an elaborate game was built around the results. Unlike the main MaGMMLs, participants were not allowed to program custom objects for their levels - but that doesn't mean this game isn't just as wacky and innovative as previous ones.\n\n48H is a spiritual successor to Make a Good 24 Hour Mega Man Level that takes place between MaGMML2 and MaGMML3, but no previous MaGMML knowledge is necessary to enjoy the story.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co80sm.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":201320,"name":"Friday Night Funkin': Hotline 024","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Meet Nikku, an alien girl that crashed on earth and was captured by a secret agency, she has been used for experimentation for years, until one day she was able to escape and decided to hide in an abandoned mall.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4r5l.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":181798,"name":"Frog Finder","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A cute lightweight puzzle game.
