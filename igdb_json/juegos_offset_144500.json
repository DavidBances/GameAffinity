These hardened military professionals, tired of bureaucracy, politics and serving the armed forces, have established a private paramilitary formation located in south United States. Being true military professionals, they periodically execute contracts for jobs that may not be considered “clean”.\n\nThe Team consists of many complex individuals with their own back story, but they do not shun mercenary applicants. Members of the team are idealists; they dwell on moral issues, as well as question blind nationalism, etc. AntiSquad strongly differ from military units. They truly are a bunch of contradictions put together - heartfelt cynics, gregarious egoists, aggressive pacifists, and phlegmatic rebels all under one banner.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fzzvtr20zck4xt17lkyn.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"BulkyPix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Plug In Digital","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"InsGames","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":6074,"name":"The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the second part of the unfolding saga that could also be enjoyed independently, you can explore new corners of this unique world and experience the mix of old-school gothic and mad science, with more action, powerful foes and plenty of stunning places to visit.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co23cr.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NeoCore Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":315402,"name":"Guns, Beats n' Dragons","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This game was made for the #lowrezjam.\nSome dragon talked shit bout your moms...

During the creation of their hero, players will be able choose their gender and freely alter their facial characteristics. This will of course have an influence on the demon's appearance.\n\nThrough its different chapters, Bound by Flame will offer many quests around a primary adventure. Depending on the choices made by the player and the influence of the demon, some chapters will offer different scenarios and a different experience. Bound by Flame also includes a crafting system, allowing them to create and improve equipment, including their armor and weapons. Several companions will join the player during his quest, and will, depending on the player's actions, develop friendship, romance or rivalry. Also, using the crafting, you can customize your weapons and armour with more depth than most other games. for example, you can change the blade and hilt of your sword separately, which not only changes its appearance, but will also change its attributes e.g., + 4 crit, + 3 speed. When fighting enemies, you can use three different fighting styles: one uses slow, heavy, damaging strikes with weapons like axes and hammers, and a push/ kick ability to interrupt enemies or break their defences; another uses small weapons like daggers for quick strikes, and gives you a dodge ability to evade enemy attacks. The third style uses fire attacks for big damage, and can be combined with the other two fighting styles to do things like enhancing weapons with fire damage. Each of the three styles has its own skill tree with both passive and active abilities. During combat, you can use other attacks aside from striking with your weapon, like a crossbow, traps, and abilities you've earned from the skill trees.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ppx.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Focus Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Spiders","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":6761,"name":"1849","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"1849 is a city management game for tablets and PCs, set during the California Gold Rush.

After all the ferocious fighting... What awaits Vedley?\n\nSkill Gems have many different powers, and when fitted into a Skill Plate, a Gem makes it possible for a character to use magic or a skill.\nBy combining Gems, characters may also be able to use special skills.\nAlso, by flicking a Skill Plate, it can be rotated, and it is easy to change the positions of skills already fitted directly corresponding to the Chronos Gauge.\n\nThe outcome of every battle comes down to the tactics you choose!\nDuring battles, the character icons are shown on the left-hand side of the screen, and next to them, a range of effects are sometimes displayed.\nThese are known as Field Effects, and if a character’s turn comes while one of those effects is shown next to their icon, the character can gain the benefits of that effect.\nHowever, Field Effects are not always advantageous. There are also disadvantageous effects. Also, effects apply to apply to both enemies and allies. However, by raising the level of the Chronos Gauge to 100% or more, you can launch Interrupt Actions. When an advantageous effect is attached to an enemy, or when a disadvantageous effect is attached to an ally, you can use an Interrupt Action to change the order of the characters' actions, and avoid these unfavorable situations.\n\nThe Chronos Gauge holds the key to victory!\nThe Chronos Gauge is necessary for characters to be able to use the Particular Skills they each have, or to be able to launch Interrupt Actions, with which the order of the characters' actions can be changed. The Gauge has a display like a clock, with the numbers 1 to 12, and at the start of a battle one of the numbers will glow. The glowing number will move clockwise each time an ally or enemy performs an action. At this time, if you use a skill corresponding to the glowing number, a Just Time Bonus will be triggered, and the level of the Gauge will recover by a large amount. Also, the level of the Gauge increases, although only by a little, when enemies are defeated.\n\nThe Gauge is shared across all party members, so it's a good idea to pay attention to the level as you use Particular Skills and launch Interrupt Actions!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7hc9.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kemco","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Magitec","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":95692,"name":"SpellPix","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":52534,"name":"Jungle Rumble: Freedom, Happiness and Bananas","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Drum to control a tribe of monkeys!

You won’t even be safe from cannon fire in the 40 brand new levels. Protect your foot soldiers and your horse-drawn carriages with covered bridges and stable pillar structures.\n\nThere are a total of five materials available to help you build the perfect bridge: wood, heavy wood, stone and ropes, along with the new addition of the bridge roof. Throughout the exciting background story, you will familiarize yourself with the various materials on a step-by-step basis, and learn everything you need to know so that your bridges meet the requirements of the different levels.\n\nInnovative game modes in store for you! Besides building stable bridges, there's also plenty on offer for veterans to discover in the new game modes. In the siege level, your bridge is bombarded by enemy catapults. Strengthen your bridge so that it doesn't collapse, and protect your own troops on the bridge with a bridge roof.\n\nIn another new game mode, you build your bridges so that they collapse under the load of enemy units to send as many of them as possible into the abyss. In addition, the unique bonus challenges will leave even the most experienced players at their wit’s end. That way, both bridge-building professionals and novices will face a challenge in Bridge Constructor Medieval.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3mkr.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Headup Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":10050,"name":"Black Rainbow","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Help Helen escape the burning village; guide her through the dark and dangerous forests and help the people of Amazonia.
