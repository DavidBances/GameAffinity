The game consists of two different soccer simulations, you can carry out a match in the stadium or indoors. The field is always shown from the top and scrolled softly into all directions. The player that is controlled at the moment can be recognized by a flickering football shirt. If you have the ball you can pass or shoot. The longer you keep the fire button pressed, the sharper the shot will be. Additionally, the trajectory bends if the joystick is pressed to the left or right. If the opponent has the ball, you can try to take it away from him with a sliding tackle. When the own keeper gets visible, you take over his controls and a press on the fire button makes the keeper jump.\n\nIndoor soccer has some fundemental changes to the rules. The ball cannot roll into the out, but it bounces from the cushion. Furthermore, the keeper can be the goalgetter himself (in contrast to the stadium where he is limited to the penalty area).\n\nIf a goal is scored, the scene is repeated in slow motion and one can watch the attack unhurriedly. Extensive and clearly arranged menus enable you to change many parameters of \"Microprose Soccer\". These range from the length of a match (2 to 12 minutes) to details of the controls. Also the weather can be changed and by this you can get a proper rain shower during the game by coincidence. With a wet ground the ball rolls further and the players sometimes slip.\n\nDifferent game modes make for diversity. Up to 15 players can enter their names and then compete with each other in a league. One can also take part in a World Cup, whereby the venue corresponds to the one of a real World Cup. The computer takes over the controls of as many teams as needed. The strengths of the teams correspond approximately to the real national teams (random exceptions can happen). Scores can be saved any time and additionally there is a \"Name Bank\", a database with names of clubs, but there is limited memory, 16 clubs can be created. Therefore you cannot import the whole Premier League, but it is enough for an own league.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5027.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sensible Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MicroProse Software, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":94627,"name":"Bool","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":94628,"name":"Arubarea no Otome","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A strategy game and a visual novel with RPG elements developped by Gimmick House.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jzv.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NCS","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Extreme Co.,Ltd","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NEC","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gimmick House","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-FX"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":94629,"name":"International Hockey","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":94630,"name":"Neutron Zapper","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":94631,"name":"Floatris","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":94632,"name":"Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh Trail","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You're trapped behind enemy lines, and must hold out 'til the bitter end.

Once the engine is empty you can fill the car with oil.\n\nDemolition Derby: You view a square track from above with the whole track on screen as you drive around the track. You attempt to smash the other cars to destroy them while avoiding being smashed yourself.\n\nFirefighting. Pulling into the fire station allows you to drive a fire engine along the road looking for any buildings on fire. Once you find a burning building you must park beside a fire hydrant.
