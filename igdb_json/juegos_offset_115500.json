This is where the Stalingrad '42 game picks up the fight, including a number of scenarios covering the drive to the Volga. After several months of bloody house to house fighting in the fall, the Soviet positions were reduced to pockets of rubble, barely 300 meters from the Volga. As the season turned to winter, Hitler remained fixated on taking the city, ultimately leading to disaster for his troops. He had badly underestimated the Soviet army's ability to mount an offensive on his flanks. The Russians cut through weak, poorly equipped, Rumanian troops and encircled the entire Sixth Army. In Stalingrad '42 you can re-fight this titanic struggle, exploring both the historical situation in addition to a number of plausible \"What If\" situations; a German retreat, a corseted flank defense, or a powerful panzer rescue force made available had Rommel been successful at El Alamein.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124714,"name":"Panzer Campaigns: Kharkov '42 Gold","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124715,"name":"Panzer Campaigns: Smolensk '41 Gold","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124716,"name":"Panzer Campaigns: Sealion '40 Gold","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124717,"name":"Panzer Campaigns: France '40 Gold","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124718,"name":"Gurgosus Wunderbar","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124719,"name":"Wonderful World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wonderful World is a free doujin fighting game focused on combo creativity.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2o1q.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ainefill","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":124720,"name":"Keep Yourself Alive","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qhf.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124721,"name":"Cubiquity","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3vtd.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124722,"name":"Legions of Dawn","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124723,"name":"Sally6","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124724,"name":"Black Dawn VI: Hellbound","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124725,"name":"Black Dawn II","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124727,"name":"Panzer Campaigns: Normandy '44 Gold","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Normandy '44 is an operational level simulation of the D-Day landings and subsequent battles to move inland fighting your way off the beaches.

Well, mainly it was just the usual dungeon exterminator's subterranean grind: killing off thousands of roaches, chopping through tar, guzzling mimic potions, and generally ridding the King's underground chambers of all that should not be there. But also Beethro met an unexpected enemy, created lifelong grudges against him, and learned secrets that would later motivate his journey to Rooted Hold.\n\nDROD: Journey to Rooted Hold\nSwordplay and puzzles combine in this thinking man's dungeon crawl. It's simple to learn, with just a handful of commands to master. But the unique gameplay provides an amazing depth. A detailed overhead view shows monsters, obstacles, and other game elements. You have as much time as you like to contemplate your next move. So this is a good game for relaxing, but also terrifically involving once you get started. You'll be hooked by the story of Beethro and his troublesome nephew, Halph. Our heroes set off on a harmless jaunt, but end up far below the surface, chased by a clownish madman. They begin to uncover a vast, underground bureaucracy, and things only get stranger the further they delve. You've got over 350 rooms ahead--each one a singular challenge for you to conquer.\n\nDROD: The City Beneath\nYou begin as a rather ugly man named \"Beethro\" who travels deep beneath the ground. There are other people down there too, citizens of a mysterious \"Rooted Empire\", that are carving tunnels and building things. Beethro just wants to know why, but it's hard to get a useful answer. He was always fond of saying \"there is no problem that can't be solved with a really big sword,\" but upon arriving at the underground capital, Beethro is startled to find that nobody seems interested in attacking him. No, for some reason, they would rather persuade him to stand in a very long line.\n25 sprawling levels with over 350 custom designed rooms, including secret rooms.\n17 types of monsters with greatly varying abilities and behavior.\n11 different characters, some of which contribute to puzzles as well as story development.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2q2q.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":124915,"name":"Sword of the Stars: The Pit - Osmium Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124916,"name":"Desktop Dungeons Goatperson","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3cei.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124917,"name":"Ether One Redux","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A version of Ether One remade in Unreal Engine 4, featuring graphical improvements.
