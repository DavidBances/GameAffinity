The app lets children experience a day of a lamb and its mother in a blooming meadow. There are no rules, goals or tasks. When children engage with the digital device for the first time, they can observe the lovingly designed and animated animals. Simple touch gestures can then be used to discover the interactivity of the game: The sheep follow the finger or can be stroked. A technically sophisticated simulation makes it a lot of fun to stroke the grass with your fingers. And children who have already tried out the app loved making the colorful flowers literally sound. The playful and self-directed experience is not disturbed by any menus. At the beginning, the game explains to parents how to prevent accidental switching to other apps. The duration of the game can also be set here. After the time has expired, the day comes to an end with a sunset. When the sheep lies down to sleep, the interaction options end and the game comes to an end.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4ts6.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Explorlings UG","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":202053,"name":"Crypto Unicorns","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A unicorn pet-collecting and farming game built on blockchain by Laguna Games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4rp3.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Laguna Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":200309,"name":"Relic Hunters: Rebels","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shoot and dash through colorful levels while crafting and upgrading dozens of weapons.
