The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.\n\nThe player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.\n\nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3c0b.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Victor Musical Industries","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nihon Falcom","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Takeru","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nihon Falcom","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sierra Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX2"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":14487,"name":"Outpost","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the first part of the 21st century, scientists discovered a huge asteroid named Vulcan's Hammer headed straight for Earth.

The game was followed by a PlayStation 2 sequel, a reimagining for the PlayStation 3 and a film adaption.\n\nSiren is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the \"Link Navigator\". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called \"Shibito\", or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.\n\nThere are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's player characters possess a psychic power named \"sightjack,\" which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non-player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they can recover after some time has passed. Characters will lose stamina during combat and while running.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p0m.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Project Siren","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SCE Japan Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":14523,"name":"Helldivers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Helldivers is a topdown shooter set in a satirical dystopian future where mankind is ruled by a managed democracy.

Knights beat Barbarians in melee; Barbarians have the advantage over Archers; and Archers have the advantage over Knights, in addition to being effective at defending against attempts to storm a fort.

The game is notable for engaging the player in brinkmanship.\n\nThe goal of the game is simple: the player may choose to be either the President of the United States or the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and must lead the chosen superpower for eight years, seeking to maximize \"prestige\" and avoiding a nuclear war. Each turn is one year long; at the beginning of each year, the player is presented with a set of incidents and crises in various countries around the globe, and must choose a response to each one. Responses may range from no action, to diplomatic notes to the other superpower, to military maneuvers. Each response is then met with a counter-response, which may vary from backing down to escalation. The player then gets a chance to initiate actions, and deal with the opponent's responses.\n\nThis core mechanic is similar to that of Bruce Ketchledge's 1983 game Geopolitique 1990, published by SSI. One difference from the earlier game is how negotiations are resolved. In both games, backing down in a negotiation results in a loss of prestige, which will reverberate politically. Likewise, in both games brinkmanship may result in a global war. In Geopolitique, such wars were actually fought in-game, after which the game continued. In Balance of Power, such a war ends the game instantly, with the following message: \"You have ignited a nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air.

When the metamorphosis gauge begins to flash, the player can transform into the dragon by pressing up and A button after jumping. As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game. The dragon's main attack is his fire breath. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. While in dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again. \nAs the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player's outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon's fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health. \nThere are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rxg2vgk39l8fanm9wpjz.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Idea","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14663,"name":"Drsná Cesta","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rpxjdbbmjcujwm6ezlog.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14664,"name":"Dugger","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Dig Dug clone.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/w1iazgq1unkmeoj8eemr.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Linel","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14665,"name":"Dylan Dog: La Regina delle Tenebre","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wxmmo4upfps0toh9kjty.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulmondo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14666,"name":"Dylan Dog: Ritorno al Crepuscolo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/iy6xwvdg26sbrxj62b3w.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulmondo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14667,"name":"Dylan Dog: Storia di Nessuno","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fmbdhil4ooajdv3deuoo.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulmondo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14668,"name":"Heavy Rain: The Taxidermist","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Heavy Rain: The Taxidermist is a prequel to Heavy Rain and offers about 15 minutes in gameplay with 5 different endings.

Rating points won in the races can be used to upgrade any of the vehicles, from a selection of 15 running gear, body or engine upgrade alternatives. Each vehicle is furnished with a detailed destruction system. Reaching the end of a course without suffering any losses is an enormous challenge that only a select few are able to accomplish. The opponents, who constantly create extreme situations, aren’t the only danger: players also need to watch out for railway crossings, heavy tanker trucks and even lightning in stormy weather.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tcnkvlolvm8gckujpqdq.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Factory Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Targem Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":14975,"name":"Virtual Villagers 2: The Lost Children","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Somewhere in the Pacific, there was a beautiful island, called Isola, where lost villagers made their home.
