Each platform has its own dustbin, and if Dust Brain bounces over this, he changes into a Madball already in the tube. Also, he will make contact with three bureaucrats who will make his task harder, but they can also be pushed of the edge of platforms, giving Dust Brain plenty of time to bounce around before the bureaucrats have the chance to resurrect themselves. \n \nEach Madball has its own speed and strength, and it can be difficult for a strong Madball to fall off a platform. Each of them also have their own energy source, which include cabbages, fish heads, bones, and Coke. When eight Madballs have been persuaded, this tube is full. When the active Madball falls off the platform, another one takes its place.

Each warlock is guarded by groups of evil creatures - You earn extra points for destroying these creatures, but they do not affect the main course of the game. Some of the rooms in the dungeon contain tomb-like weapon generators which create vicious weapons such as spinning knives. Destruction of the weapons earns you nothing but you can shoot the generators for extra points. \nSome rooms also have mysterious symbols embedded in the floor. The symbols are called Floor Glyphs and are of four different types. One type is used to weave magic spells, another may be fired to destroy some or all your enemies in the room. The other two types are used to reveal a plan of the current level of the dungeon or to transport you to a new level. When you defeat a warlock you should strive to capture the magic runes which he releases because you may then use them to conjure spells to make yourself stronger in attack and less vulnerable in defence. When you have cleared the top level of the dungeon you will be strong enough to proceed downwards to tackle the more aggressive warlocks and their guardian creatures which lurk below.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rxhwugufhr35cn9k3lie.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":29036,"name":"Short Circuit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Number 5 struck by a freak lightning bolt now has feelings and is ready for INPUT!!!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/boci1zlw6uyaqaoi5qf8.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":29035,"name":"Short Circuit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co738g.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":28824,"name":"Shockway Rider","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Take to the moving sidewalks of the future as you attempt to go Full Circle on the Shockway.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8hg7.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":28022,"name":"SRD: Super Real Darwin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"SRD: Super Real Darwin is a 1987 vertical scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Data East.

The source code for Plutos was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware.\n\nPlutos is a vertically oriented space shooter that features gameplay similar to Raiden. The game features six different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Only three of these levels are unique graphically--the other three are just color palette changes. Plutos offers one player as well as two player simultaneous modes, selectable with the left difficulty switch. Plutos also has features a unique weapons power-up system. There are three different types of weapons, each of which can be upgraded up to four times, as well as an invincibility power-up. The three different weapons are: Dual machine guns, spread gun, and energy gun.\n\nA partially compiled version of Plutos was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Plutos was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mc9.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 7800"}]},{"id":15337,"name":"Pengy","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":15328,"name":"Oids","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rescue the OIDS from the Fiendish Biocretes who are turning them into vending machines and household appliances!

On this screen you can control the speed of your ship and steer it with black dots showing the enemy forces. The status screen shows a profile of your ship and any damage is shown as red and if the whole ship is red then it is damaged and the game is over. \n \nWhen an attack is imminent then a gauge besides one of the mini-game icons turns yellow before turning red and that game can be played. If an aircraft is attacking then the game has you controlling a gun to shoot down the planes viewed from a 1st person perspective. You can move the gun left or right and move it up or down to hit the planes before they drop bombs on your ship. This screen is also used for any missile attack. \n \nIf any convoy's of ships are attacking then you must fire a missile at the convoy by first lining up a sight that keeps moving while a timer counts down. When the time reaches zero and the sight is red then it will hit a ship but if it doesn't turn red then you have missed. \n \nThe final game is when a submarine is attacking and the game switches to a 3D side view showing above and below the water. You control a helicopter above the water while the submarine is below. You can move the helicopter left or right, and in and out of the screen. A cursor of the left of the screen moves up and down and when fire is pressed this drops a depth charge which also stops the cursor and this shows the depth your depth charge will explode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dfjfrz7uqhctrlwmavd9.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":13510,"name":"Combat Zone","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co827h.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13496,"name":"Classic Muncher","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"OK kiddies, let's play a little game. I'll start describing the scenario of this cute little original game by Bubble Bus, and you tell me when you think you can guess the game before it loads All right ? Here we go:\n\n\"... Living in a haunted mansion isn't much fun, especially when the ghouls take over. Muncher man must gather up all the food before the ghouls get him !'\n\nNo, Muncher Man does not come from Munich, and I don't know why he doesn't get his food from the nearest McDonalds. Maybe he's a trendy veggie? I see you're going to need further clues.\n\nMuncher Man's house looks suspiciously like a maze, with lots of little round bits of food in it (Not yet! Wait a bit). You have to wander about the maze, eating the food, and avoiding the ghouls (now you can start guessing).\n\nWhen you eat a special pill (left over from a previous police raid), you can chase and eat the ghouls (but go easy on the spirits), getting a large bonus from your local exorcist as you do so.(You must have it by now). Fruits pop up in the maze at random.\n\nWhat do you mean, \"I haven't got it yet?\" Insert tape in ear, press any key and re-read from start. This fiippin' well is Pac Man, however deceptive the picture of the dinosaur might be on the cover. Mind you, with names like Classic Muncher, Back Man, or Ghost Gobbling or some such, waddya expect? Asteroids?\n\nYou certainly don't get many hints from the loading screen - there isn't one. Another missing link is the sound effects - not exactly stunning, to say the least. At least you can use your own idea of keyboard and/or joystick layout.\n\nThe sneaky bit that got me at the end of the first screen was that they went and changed the maze around. You don't see that on many Pac Man clones, though this one certainly swiped enough memory for several different maps.\n\nIf you're into being grabbed by the ghoulies in the hedges with some fruit, then you could do worse than buy this one. Bubble Bus are currently running a competition on the high scores. The prize, more software. But don't let that influence you unnecessarily.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6sxd.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13492,"name":"Chronos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5xnm.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13479,"name":"Championship Water-Skiing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xupj3f8mcf1juvxpaocn.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":13473,"name":"Centurions: Power X Treme","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lu4exbgxp8lcixsxzmm4.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13467,"name":"Catch 23","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A puzzle game from Zero Logic Games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fqwmhxpm0rxdpz6qfzj9.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":13462,"name":"Captain America in: The Doom Tube of Dr. Megalomann","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Captain America in the Doom Tube of Dr. Megaloman is a platform/action game developed in 1987 for the Commodore 64 iIt is based on the comic book license of the same name.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zqbvhj7mspxdc7ygntqw.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":13448,"name":"Bubbler","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bubbler is a classic isometric platform game.

Very similar to ACE, except that you can now play a 2-player hotseat game, or solo competition against the computer, in split-screen mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ctb.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore 16"}]},{"id":13270,"name":"3D Starfighter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A 3D space shooter written by the Oliver twins and published by Codemasters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co695h.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13047,"name":"Wiz Biz","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vadkl4qgfxfcqmydww8t.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13046,"name":"Werewolves of London","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Werewolves of London is an 8-bit game in which the player takes on the role of the werewolf who must destroy the seven family members who have cursed him with lycanthropy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8h5e.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13044,"name":"Warlock","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this isometric action-adventrue the player slips in the role of the evil Doomlord whos castle is under siege from the White Wizard and his hordes of do-gooders.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/unnkfehhk8htyewezzva.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]}]
