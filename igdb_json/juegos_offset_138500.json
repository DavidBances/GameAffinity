And with no sponsors paying your way, you can enjoy every minute of every day without any interruptions. Private students also benefit from a more continuous experience that never ends until you want it to. If you fail to graduate, repeat the year. If you get expelled, walk the streets as a civilian. Even death holds no fear for those with \"private\" health care! \n \nThe prison from Hard Time has closed down and re-opened as a school, but the challenge to survive and thrive remains the same. Live every hour of every day in real-time - from getting out of bed in the morning to attending a timetable full of classes, as you explore a city filled with interactive props. Picking up knowledge from each class helps you answer real questions in 10 different subjects, as you work towards the grades you need to graduate. But with over 100 fellow students walking the halls, an equally important popularity contest decides whether your days are filled with fun or fear.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sxj6dxzooogmoa5of3dg.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":85061,"name":"Cube Blitz","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cube Blitz is a physics based puzzle game that will test your skills using the GamePad.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/j4a7rmnapnb1ytlxs6rd.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Wildcard Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":84655,"name":"G.G Series Assault Buster","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hold your position as the last defense!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/axba33lqmdn1yswml1ur.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":84654,"name":"G.G Series Black X Block","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Assemble the blocks to get to the goal!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rndg0wyvaorvd6gls4ol.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":84653,"name":"G.G Series Altered Weapon","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unleash the power of the Altered Weapon!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hfqkxepoa4f3enpfr749.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":84651,"name":"G.G Series Cosmo Rally!!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Compete in a Cosmic race to the finish!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/snmmulzfrkcqifwggvsz.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":84569,"name":"G.G Series Hero Puzzle","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fight monsters with the Hero Puzzle!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lvyh70kggzqrri8azmck.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":84562,"name":"G.G Series The Spiky Blowfish!!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Spiky Blowfish!!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bsj0kgraj3rbi3t6v73r.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":82105,"name":"New Atelier Rorona: The Alchemist of Arland","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This remake of Atelier Rorona for the Nintendo 3DS was released exclusively in Japan in 2015 and features a new chibi art style alongside a new battle system.
