That's how it looks, that's how it plays. (Ok. I made the lava chasing the player faster in one scene, but you don't really want that.)\n\nThere are a little over 40 levels at the time of release, some longer than others. The time that it takes to beat each level is highly dependent on player ability.\n\nYour progress is saved at the end of every level. You may use the level select to go back and replay any level and also utilize it to return to your furthest point of progress.\nThe good. You should buy this game if:\n-You like a challenge-\nThe game is hard, most people don't beat it. It is hard in a fair way, if you die it's because you sucked.\n\n-You enjoy grappling hooks-\nThe grappling hook here tends to be more dynamic than some other hooks. You still have a lot of control over it, but you have to learn its ins and outs.\n\n-You like piano music-\nYou won't be able to hear different music if you keep dying.\n\n-You want a game to beat you for a change-\nEven if it's just temporary.\nThe bad. Avoid this game if:\n-You are expecting a story-\nThere is no explicit story in this game.\n\n-You expect dialogue-\nThere is no text aside from the title screen and option menus.\n\n-You suck-\nBut I know you can do it. Growth mindset.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2v3n.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Capsule Collapse","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":144606,"name":"Derelict Void","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Derelict Void is a galactic roguelike city-builder involving scavenging for resources and base management.
