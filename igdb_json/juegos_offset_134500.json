The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process.

Well, this is Fat Rat Pinball, a nice casual game free to play! The challenges of a classic pinball are mixed up with the rat body physics creating a unique, unexpected and fun pinball arcade game.\n\nWith this new game you'll see animals flying over the pinball machine, being hit by the flippers, bouncing as a ball in the bumpers and increasing your score on each collision. But don't panic - no animals are hurt in this game. Everything happens in a nice way.\n\nAs a casual game, you can try to beat up one of the pinball tables in about ten minutes. Some pinball machines have stages, as a kind of runner, and you go up until the end point. So, it's part of the game challenge to win the tables, but you'll need to be skilled to do it.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: one touch in the right or left screen side and you'll activate the respective flipper. For launching the ball, you should touch the screen and slide down to choose the spring force. It's possible to play with one finger - one hand game - but we recommend using both hands for more speed on activating the paddles.\n\nFat Rat Pinball uses a reward system, and you can earn rubies while playing. Completing a pinball table a couple of times will make you earn rubies enough to release new content inside the game. There are rewarded Ads after the matches and you can choose if you want to watch them or not - you are not forced to see any Ad while playing.\n\nUsing your rubies can release new characters and tables for playing. The actual version comes with 3 pinball machines and 4 bodies-balls.\n\nThe score records and achievements are incorporated with Game Center services, where you can see the game rankings.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2y81.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Invent4 Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":145989,"name":"GreedFall: Gold Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Greedfall: Gold Edition is the most complete way to experience the critically-acclaimed RPG, including the base game and the De Vespe conspiracy story expansion.

The show's next season was held back to properly strategize the direction to take. TMNT 2003 had ultimately suffered from weak writing, making use of very involved plots but not comfortably telling the stories needed to be told, and as such the audience left. The decision was made to entirely skip the next season in favor of airing the semi-reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward, sending the brothers into the future and equiping themselves in cybernetic armor. Fast Forward had a distinctly different art style and the tone was much more lighthearted than before, though it failed to make any great impact on either ratings or merchandise due to the paper-thin premise. Only one game was produced to tie in with Fast Forward, Ninja Training NYC.\n\nNinja Training NYC is very much a standard action title for mobile phones, dumbing the concept down to make it suitable for a numberpad controller wihout any complicated controls. In this game, the TMNT must train in two specific categories, Combat and Agility.\n\nIn Combat, the turtle is situated center screen and must take out holographic men in suits wearing towels on their heads by pressing 4 or 6 repeatedly, or 2 in order to jump and attack. Certain enemies will drop special items which can be used to refill energy, and there is also a special meter that fills up; when full, it can be used to launch a shellshocker attack using the 5 key.\n\nIn Agility, the turtle of choice must run left or right to find the correct car which will fall down or find a hole to avoid getting killed off by the downward scrolling screen. The speed of the scrolling increases over time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7nnb.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Go Comics","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Overloaded","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":146105,"name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Battle of the City","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Battle for the City is a dedicated console system published by Tech2Go and developed by WayForward Technologies.

Upon opening the gate, the player will enter a room where a boss lies in wait.\n\nIf all of a Turtle's energy is depleted, or he falls into a chasm, he is considered \"Captured\" and another Turtle must be selected. A game over occurs when all four Turtles are captured.

A fact not that easy to understand when having a try at the series' first entry, as it feels quite unpolished.\n\nThe story about a warrior that seeks revenge on the evil lord that has slaughtered his entire village is a beaten horse, but where the game falls flat the most is its action battle system. There's a severe lack of variety, as the hero only knows no offensive moves other than a standard combo and a dash attack. A block button is supposed to bring more depth to the fighting, but it puts the player in a worse situation more often than not, so a combination of evasion and button mashing is always more effective, the incredibly stupid AI takes care of the rest. Even the bosses seem ridiculously easy at first, that is until they switch into near-invincible mode, which requires hours of grinding to even be able to touch them at this state. There are also only three different weapon types, swords, halberds and (utterly useless) bows. Funny enough, there is a bar that recharges in between attacks and determines the strength of the next stroke, much like in Final Fantasy Adventure on the classic Game Boy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ygl.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"HiCom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146209,"name":"Corum II: Dark Lord","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A far superior sucessor that introduced many improvements, for example a battle system that actually made sense.

To begin with, the story appears much less stereotypical than before. Three mythical sages seek to bring balance to the world by unleashing the power of an ancient magical artefact, the Jumarion. As they can't seize it themselves, they seek out the help of a mortal mage, who longed for the artifact all his life, and leaves a less than thrustworthy impression. Of all this the young knight Kaien knows nothing when he embarks on his pilgrimage. Rather he has to deal with a bunch of supersticious villainers and an alledgedly cursed little girl with a really strange personality...\n\nFor the first time the prerendered graphics are rather good-looking, though they still appear sterile. The combat system has also been improved greatly and now stands nothing short of the greatest of beat 'em up-esque ARPGs like Terranigma or Story of Thor. Magic has never been a strength of the Corum series. Now some of the spells actually come in form of special moves that have to be executed during combos, making their usage much more natural.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Kaien gathers a party of three characters overall. Rather than fighting at the same time at his side, they're available to the player to switch in between them during the game. It goes without saying that each of them comes with their individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\nUnusual for action RPGs, Corum III comes with a network version. The three playable characters would have suited well for cooperative play, but instead the game offers several arena modes, as well as a dungeon rush. It is a nice extra, but amounts to little more than a gimmick in the end.\n\nThe music is by far the best in the series as well. The game was originally released on three CDs, whith the last one entirely dedicated to the CD-audio sountrack. Did the first two games suffer from a rather small selection of songs available, Corum III got the right tune for every mood.\n\nAltogether, Corum III may be the best single player action RPG ever developed in Korea, and it was a loss for Germany that this was passed for a localization in favor of its still rather unpolished predecessor. This time Japan got more lucky, as Bothtec provided a translated version over there. The most funny and at the same time most sad thing is, Corum III actually made it to the US, yet hardly anyone ever got to play it there as the localization was handled by Gobe Software, then publisher of BeOS. Thus the game was only available for that not exactly widespread operating system.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ygn.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"HiCom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146211,"name":"Corum Side Story","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The \"Side Story\" in the title already implies that this isn't an ordinary entry in the series, but the extend to which it did away with everything the popular series was known for came as quite a shock for its fans.

The first sequel to Puzzle Bobble, it was titled in Europe and North America as Bust-A-Move Again on the arcade and Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition on the home consoles.\n\nThe game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta.\n\nCompletion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.\n\nThe North American version of the original arcade release is much different than the other versions. One of the most major changes in this version is that Bub and Bob were removed from the game and replaced with a pair of disembodied hands. Also, the characters that were in the Vs. CPU mode were removed and replaced with a generic computer. The backgrounds from the original version were also removed and replaced with 15 new backgrounds, but this also means that the backgrounds get looped in the Puzzle mode, which is 30 stages long. The audio was also changed, and the voices in the game were removed, even though they were in English anyway. These changes were only made for the Taito F3 System version, since the Neo Geo and console releases are based on the original Japanese version.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6iqc.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo MVS"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo AES"}]},{"id":146218,"name":"Final Fantasy VI","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Final Fantasy VI has received a remake for Android and iOS devices, and its graphical presentation is enhanced compared to previous versions in highly-detailed 2D.

The game is based on the 2007 film TMNT.\n\nIt is an arcade game, which combines action-adventure and racing levels.\n\nLike most big movie titles, a mobile phone tie-in was developed for the TMNT movie and was available on all Symbian phones a few weeks prior to the release of the console video game and the movie. Based very loosely on the events on the film, Power of 4 consists of mixture of platforming stages and high speed chase sequences.\n\nThe platforming stages are heavily influenced by the old Shinobi games, featuring a lower plane and upper plane which the turtles can jump onto, and crates that can be either smashed or used for cover from gun-wielding maniacs and later sword-wielding Foot. There are also some roadside objects which can be used to your advantage like a block of logs which rolls down over any enemy which stands in the way. The Turtles are controlled by the surrounding buttons 4 and 6, while 2 acts as a jump and 8 crouches down. The 5 button will attack. At certain points, there are also other objectives such as protecting April from being hurt in order to complete the mission.\n\nThe racing stages are overhead high speed stages where the turtle van is being chased by the prehistoric mythical creature seen in the film along with other baddies. The goal of these stages is to spill oil onto the street to keep the opposing force at a distance. 4 and 6 steer the van in different directions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yih.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Overloaded","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"UCLICK Digital Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":146242,"name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Ninja Tribunal","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Ninja Tribunal is a 2009 mobile phone game by 4mobile.
