Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\n\nDan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan's health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player fills it with enough souls from defeated enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a legendary hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the game's true ending is revealed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co84x3.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SCE Cambridge Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"}]},{"id":299390,"name":"Paraiso","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Get the cup of immortality and escape the temple with all the treasures you can find!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co84x6.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":299391,"name":"Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This game is a sequel to the first Pursuit Force.

Each level starts with a mindless worker moving steadily from one side of the factory to the other along an incomplete gantry.

The process is repeated until the worker makes it to safety at the platform at the other end of the screen, or four workers have died. Complicating matters are a pair of elevators in the centre of the screen whose touch will be fatal to the steel worker.\n\nThere are five types of bridge that may be placed at any time: horizontal, slanting up, slanting down, staircase up and staircase down. A different selection needs to be made depending if the worker is moving left or right, giving a total of ten options. These are chosen using a cursor which can be moved left or right across the bottom of the screen and pressing the select button. There is also a reverse button which will turn the worker around, but this can only be performed a maximum of nine times in total. Points are awarded for adding parts of the gantry, and for the worker successfully crossing the screen.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9a4b.jpg","releaseYear":1980,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":299482,"name":"Mikuni Field Combat","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This is a shooting game that combines futuristic weapons with the worldview of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and has been well-received since its release as an app for NTT DoCoMo in May of this year, so it has now been ported to Yahoo!

The game was in development by Marigul and Media Factory and probably it would have been published by Nintendo. The player had to collect a series of cards to use them in combat as in Magic The Gatering.\n\nDT 64 was shown at the Space World 1999 in a non-playable form: there was just a logo and some text , with the GameBoy Link Cable, that would have been used to connect the two Nintendo consoles. The GameBoy could have been used as a controller for the 64DD game, to check the card statistics and share data with a presumed Bloodmaster GB version. The two games, one for the 64DD and one for the GB, would had exchanged data to integrate parts of the story and unlock new levels / cards. Players would have been able to play online with the 64DD Randnet Network, to trade cards and complete their collection.\n\nIn a scan from a Japanese magazine, we can read: “A controller with a brain.” Even if the translation is not accurate because an ideogram is hide by the reflection of the light, making it unrecognizable, the concept is certainly intriguing.

Speaking with the animal it was possible to became his friend, feed him and explore the world.\nFor many it will be a shocking news, but “Teo” is not the name of the dolphin / bird, but of the planet where he is living.
