It is made using the Pokémon Emerald disassembly made by the Pret team. This game is focused on refining a game considered a classic while using 20+ years of hindsight to improve the experience. Emerald is a great game with a ton of flaws when you look at the game critically; poor Pokémon availability, odd team-building choices, a great story executed poorly, baffling rival decisions, and an Elite Four in dire need of improvement. Despite these flaws, Pokémon Emerald has maintained a positive reputation with memorable Pokédex additions, fantastic gym leader ace Pokémon, abilities, the Battle Frontier, and overall being a large step forward for the series. The Legacy Project aims to improve what makes this game great while improving its flaws.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9649.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"TheSmithPlays","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":323002,"name":"Virus Hunter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Become a nanomachine and defend the human body from viruses and bacteria!
