Bodenplatte was the German code word for the bold operation to launch a surprise low-level attack on multiple Allied airfields on Jan 1st, 1945. It contains eight aircraft (additional Collector Planes are available as separate DLCs).\n\nBattle of Bodenplatte puts you at the scene of some of the most important battles on the Western Front as the Allies are knocking on Germany’s door and trying to cross the Rhine River into Germany for the first time. Fly in support of Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and Operation Bodenplatte. Try to once and for all destroy the Luftwaffe or try to blunt the Allied advance into Germany. It’s was the peak piston-engine power and the dawn of the jet age, a time when famous Allied aces roamed the sky and desperate German defenders were trying to just survive, now outnumbered and no longer the masters of the air. Fight in aerial engagements over lush, green farmland and dense wooded forests or find yourself twisting and turning over frozen fields and icy rivers of the bitterly cold winter of 1944-45. Do you have the skills to survive the harrowing air combat?\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Bodenplatte adds a new Western front theater to the IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series of products. Steam requires you own Battle of Stalingrad before you can add Battle of Bodenplatte. Combined with Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Moscow and Battle of Kuban, the series covers the combat pilot experience spanning both Eastern and Western fronts in WWII. Dogfight over the frozen steppes of Russia, the scenic mountains and beaches the Caucasus region or the doorstep of Germany itself. There is not a more monumental combat flight-simulator experience on the market with such a wide range of planes and theaters crafted to this level of detail. The physics, realism, systems, beauty, atmosphere, features, gameplay, performance, history and options combine to set a new standard of playability and fun in this important genre. IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series is not a simply a PC game, it’s an AIR COMBAT SIMULATOR.

Combat is not implemented yet, but the player driven economy offers many options to mine, trade or build cities, facilities and stations.\n\nAny new player can create their individual character selecting from various skills and more than 50 different races from Star Wars (Wookies, Twi'leks etc). They can then join an existing group - from the infamous Empire to less famous smaller production, trading or even pirate groups - and later found their own company.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 planets that can be explored and colonised. Player characters can own their own ships, vehicles, buildings, cities or even companies. Also player groups (\"factions\") can be owners of anything, setting the Star Wars Combine apart from alliances and guilds in many other similar games.\n\nThe Star Wars Combine offers many roles to choose from and thus allows the player to not only live their own dream of being whatever they want in the Star Wars universe, but also to adapt the game to their favoured style of play, playing the game as more of an adventure, a strategy game, a business sim, or just enjoying the lively community of like minded gamers and Star Wars fans.\n\nDespite the current lack of combat the Star Wars Combine offers a complexity and variety rather unusual for free browser games.

Similarly to Reborn, Pokémon Rejuvenation is not a ROM hack, but a standalone game made with RPG Maker.\n\nThe game takes place in the Aevium region, which was split into several islands after some catastrophic event in the past. The protagonist and their mother, Nancy, are headed there aboard the S.S. Oceana when it gets attacked by local villainous team Team Xen. With the ship destroyed and their mother captured, the protagonist is narrowly saved and escapes to East Gearen City — shaken, but ready to challenge the Pokémon League, take the fight to Team Xen, and hopefully, rescue their mother in the process.\n\nLike its inspiration, Pokémon Reborn, Pokémon Rejuvenation has a more mature story than mainline Pokémon games (albeit not as dark as Reborn's). It also features much more difficult encounters, with two difficulty levels available: Story and Classic. The game borrows Reborn's ideas of a field effect system, 18 Gym Leaders, and a level cap, but also replaces the traditional Elite 4 with an Elite 8 and grants new, unique moves to every gym leader. In addition, the game brings back Shadow Pokémon from Pokémon Colosseum and its sequel, now rebalanced, with Fairy-type Pokémon resisting their attacks.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5stf.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Reborn, Evolved","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Janichroma","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":139329,"name":"Unvanquished","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unvanquished is a free, open-source first-person strategy game shooter, pitting technologically advanced human soldiers against hordes of highly adaptable aliens.
