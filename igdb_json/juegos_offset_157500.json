Players use Explodemon's self-destructive nature to combat enemies and fly through the air, all the while solving a huge variety of physics-based puzzles (and, naturally, causing incalculable collateral damage).\n\nWhen the peaceful planet of Nibia is attacked by the malicious Vortex forces, the fate of the star system is thrust into the one pair of hands it shouldn't be: the malfunctioning Guardian robot Explodemon.\n\nFeaturing 12 huge levels of pulse-pounding platforming, a deep control system, devastatingly up-close-and-personal combat, upgradable special abilities, comic-book style cutscenes and a story that'll make you giggle, cry, or simply sigh with indifference, Explodemon isn't your average game. No way. It's above average, at least. No, wait - so way above average that it's pure awesome. That's more like it.\n\nExplodemon! is unrelenting, hard-core brain-tickling action for those who grew up playing platformers, as well as those who'll discover just how awesome they were.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3qhi.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Curve Digital","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Curve Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":7216,"name":"Test Drive Unlimited 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Test Drive Unlimited 2 (abbreviated as TDU2) is an open world racing video game developed by Eden Games and published by Atari.

The goal on each level is to eat a set quota of fish whilst avoiding enemy eels, piranhas, sharks and falling anchors. Your mollusk isn't defenseless though - you have a reserve of ink at your disposal! \n \nThe fish stock of each ocean is rapidly depleting - much like in real life - so you'll have to move quick. The stock level reduces when fish leave the screen, so try not to let too many get past you as you zoom about the ocean! When the stock runs out, you'll lose a life. \n \nThe simple HUD on the bottom of the screen functions using both characters and colours. Ink is represented by eight little droplets. These deplete with use and can be recharged by eating jellyfish. Standard ink (grey on the HUD) scares enemies or other fish away and is obtained by eating white jellyfish, whereas poisonous ink (red on the HUD) kills enemies. When you have a reserve of poisonous ink left, any additional ink obtained will also become poisonous. Note that kills achieved using poisonous ink are added towards your fish quota. \n \nYour Mollusk can take two hits from eels or anchors, after which point the lives counter on the HUD will flash red. Another hit will cost you a life, and note that blue eels also slow the Mollusk down. Sharks and piranhas are deadly to touch. \n \nThe fish stock level flashes red and an audible alarm sounds when there are 20 or less fish left in the ocean.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":41166,"name":"Bloodwheels","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Originally intended to be released in 1994 during the commercial decline of the Commodore 64, Bloodwheels was unreleased until 2011 when it was included in the 'Shoot 'Em Up Destruction Set 2' package by Psytronik. \n \nIn this game you control an armoured vehicle on a mission that takes you through an arid desert-scape, a war-torn town, over bridges, through an army base, through dense jungle and an evacuated city, and more.

As with other games of its kind, the idea is to prevent wave after wave of enemy troops to get to the player's command center. This is done by building stationary turrets that automatically shoot at the enemies that come within their range. At the start of the game the player has a small sum of cash that can be spent on different turrets such as chain guns, missiles and flame throwers. By destroying enemy troops and surviving waves the player gets more money that can be used for building new turrets or upgrade old turrets.\n\nThe game consists of four different scenarios (beach, snow, platform and lava) each with three levels. A level consists of 20 or more enemy waves and once completed the next is unlocked. While the first scenario (beach) is straightforward tower defending the later scenarios adds additional level features that lead to further tactical considerations for the player. In the snow scenario enemy soldiers can travel safely underground while the platform levels feature conveyor belts that increase the speed of the troops. The lava levels feature platforms that can be moved around by the player. Some levels have neutral buildings that can taken over by engineers. The player then receivers a special function that can be used at any time, for example a rocket attack that destroys all enemy troops.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8fuf.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gameloft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":304262,"name":"Bubble Blast","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player must help Patrick with navigating the Chum Caverns by having him avoid bumping into stuff as he progresses.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8aok.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Workinman","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":301775,"name":"SuperFly DX","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"SuperFly DX is a horizontally scrolling action game with deceptively simple one-button control and rock-solid 50/60fps gameplay.
