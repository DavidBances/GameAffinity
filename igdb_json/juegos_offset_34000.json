The main character is drifting as a spirit in the ruins that suddenly appear from under the sea. There is no explanation as to why he has become a spirit or what he has to do, but by exploring the ruins, the situation becomes dimly apparent.\n\nOne of the highlights of this game is the spirit ride system, in which the player possesses a defeated opponent. The attack methods and durability vary depending on the possessed body, so the key to the strategy is which creature you possess as you continue your search. In addition, the items that can be obtained change depending on the player's actions, and the storyline and ending change, so it is up to the player to decide how to proceed with the exploration of the ruins. The ability to experiment with this and that is a unique aspect of this game.\n\nThe cinematic elements of the game, such as the rich sci-fi character designs, the profound movements of the humanoid characters, and the effective sound of the waves, will add to the excitement of the game. The opening and ending music was composed by Crystal King, which was a big hit at the time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mxb.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"D4 Enterprise","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":280824,"name":"Super Mario and the Monstrous Manor","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mario gets invited to explore a haunted manor in this unconventionally-structured major hack.\n\nSolve puzzles, collect keys, and fight enemies to uncover the mystery of the manor","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7jcs.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MrComit","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 64"}]},{"id":277080,"name":"Takua 64","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Takua 64 is a major total conversion mod for Super Mario 64 created by Superstupidy to bring the world of Bionicle into the N64 3D platforming era!\n\nWith environment and level design inspired by games like Metroid Prime, Tomb Raider, and of course, the many Bionicle games that had a huge influence on this game‚Äôs world.\nMNOG,\nMNOGII,\nBionicle the Game,\nThe Legend of Mata Nui,\nand Tales of the Tohunga,\nbeing primary examples.\n\nWith 99 ‚ÄúToa Stones‚Äù to find and collect, Takua 64 is a very large romhack feturing 12 levels, each with multiple areas to explore and challenges to overcome.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co85ym.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Superstupidy","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 64"}]},{"id":274172,"name":"Parasite Flower","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A short disturbing horror game where you're playing as Ari Yeong, she is re-living the same day over and over again .
