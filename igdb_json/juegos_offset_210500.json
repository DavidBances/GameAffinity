Each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. Certain objects have special uses (e.g. keys open certain doors), and there is a puzzle element to the game to discover how some of these objects relate to the world in order to help the player solve the game.\n\nIn addition to carrying objects, they could also be stacked on top of each other to enable Isvar to climb up to rooms above him or to reach important objects perched high above on platforms. There are also a number of secret areas in the castle that are not visually obvious to the player and can only be discovered through exploration.\n\nDuring Isvar's exploration of the castle he is accosted by its guards and monsters - trolls, monks, guards, tornadoes, man-eating plants, bubbles, etc. all of which weaken Isvar's energy. The castle also contains food and magical potions which will restore his health. In addition, certain game objects can affect the enemies, (by either killing them, distracting them, or freezing them, depending on the object and the type of enemy they are used upon)\n\nOnce defeated in combat a guard disappears leaving only his helmet behind. Helmets can be picked up and carried by Isvar, and placed somewhere else out of harms way (or into the path of a tornado, that destroys any object it touches). If Isvar leaves the room, the guard will regenerate from the helmet.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6884.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad PCW"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":12986,"name":"Contamination","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/q7aroeryvkctufz7qtmg.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":12975,"name":"Zzzz","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Zzzz is a single player text adventure game with graphics.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gi1x6tb7r0390r21nodw.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":12968,"name":"Time Tunnel","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Time Tunnel is a computer game for the Commodore 64.

In each battle, the timer starts at one minute and thirty seconds, and when it drops to zero before any player is knocked out, the player with the least amount of damage wins. Players can monitor this by looking at their life bars. At the start of the fight, both players life bars are blue, but as the fight progresses, the life bar changes to a pink color for the player with the least amount of health remaining or most damage taken.

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.\n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.\n\nCharacter creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.\n\nThese unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.\n\nUltima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.\n\nThe FM Towns version, while identical to the others in gameplay, introduces upgraded graphics similar to those used in next installment of the series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2cqa.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"FM-7"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"}]},{"id":2864,"name":"Temple of Apshai Trilogy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Temple of Apshai Trilogy includes updated graphical versions of three classic Apshai games:\n\n-Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai\n-Dunjonquest: Upper Reaches of Apshai\n-Dunjonquest: Curse of Ra","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lampalbhntlwdphocs6f.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Thomson MO5"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":12893,"name":"World Soccer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"World Soccer, known as Great Soccer in the US and Super Futebol in Brazil, is a sports game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Master System.

While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, it also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies.

You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost!

You start the game on a bird flying over the landscape which is a horizontally side view scrolling shooter as you avoid or shoot Nomads on birds as well. The Nomads will fire back with fireballs and if you are hit by a fireball or touch a Nomad then you lose one of five lives. As you progress rocks and huge droplets will also fall from the sky and have to be avoided.\n\nAfter a certain distance of flying you must now disembark your bird and carry on across the landscape on foot. This part of the game is viewed once again from the side with the screen constantly scrolling. The Nomads are once again flying on their birds with rocks and droplets falling from the sky but you also have to jump gaps or lose a life if you fall in. If you survive the hostile lands you now play various single screen platform games with various floors connected by ladders and stairs. There are various creatures moving about the screen and touching one loses a life and to complete the screen you have to collect a certain number of items.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vaxyyattugik4iewt3gd.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":47245,"name":"Skyjet","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are the pilot of a helicopter and your mission is to explore five levels to find parts to help build a supply base on each level.

To do so means digging downwards, making sure it does not smash in the process. As a puzzle-platformer, everything is affected by gravity, and if the egg falls from a great height, it will smash. Success is achieved by making your way down the playfield carefully.\n\nYou control a penguin. 1 jumps, 2 digs. The penguin can push the egg left or right, and can jump on it to make sure it doesn't get stuck against a wall. Digging affects the tile one block left (or right) and one block down away from the penguin's position, meaning it is impossible to dig straight downwards. If the egg gets into a position where it cannot be moved left or right, jumping and landing on it will cause it to smash.\n\nThe penguin cannot be damaged, but can be temporarily stunned, the objective being to protect the egg, not necessarily yourself.

The spies must gather the three segments of a rocket and then dive into a sea where a submarine awaits them. However, only connected segments can be carried at any one time.

The game was originally going to be released by Taito America, but the company never released it because they closed down their manufacturing plant in September 1984. However, the game still credits Taito America and has a 1984 copyright date on the title screen. The player must use two eight-way joysticks (one for moving and one for firing) to take control of a nuclear scientist whose objective is to escape from a flooding reactor as the water's level rises below him before running out of air (which is indicated by the \"AIR LEFT\" meter at the top of the screen) - and every blue-and-magenta square he collects shall add ten shots to his reserve (indicated by the number above the \"AIR LEFT\" meter that starts at 50 for every level), which he must use to shoot creatures that block his progress. Like Mario and Luigi in Mario Bros., the scientist may also disappear off one side of the screen and reappear on the other, but to make him jump, the player needs to push a button on top of the \"firing\" joystick (and good timing is essential for reaching the moving, magenta platforms); furthermore, once the scientist reaches the level's exit, he will receive a bonus of 100 points for every shot remaining in his reserve.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co88ck.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":300566,"name":"Formula 1","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pass the oncoming cars in this BASIC version of Grand Prix Driver.
