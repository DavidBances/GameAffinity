Unfortunately, on his first day of school, he gets caught up in some sudden trouble, and accidentally breaks an expensive-looking statue.\n\nIn order to compensate for the broken statue, the principal orders him and the boy who caused the incident to work for the school’s “Bureau for the Investigation of Special Affairs.”\n\nWhen they arrive at the Bureau’s headquarters, a room situated in the school’s enormous underground library, a girl is waiting for them there with an apathetic look on her face.\n\nThe girl informs the confused pair of the situation: Magic exists in this school.\n\nWhen the clock tower chimes, the “Realm of Night” appears, and merges with the school building. The Bureau’s job is to take care of the supernatural problems that arise. And so, Michiru struggles to protect the school from troublesome magical items known as “Mists”…\n\nA Clockwork Ley-Line: Zanei no Yoru ga Akeru Toki\n\nMichiru and Ushio continue to spend their days solving problems at Tenbinruri Academy as part of the special investigation office, otherwise known as ‘Tokusa’. One day, a foreign girl named Adelheid came to seek their help in looking for her grandmother’s memento.

Meanwhile, the school principal who had also vanished secretly planned to bring back the night world from the other side.

Impossible Mission was the first game to use real synthesized speech, an incredible development when first unleashed on the 8-bit formats. The original game included a random game-map system which ensured that no two games were the same. Although the original still stands the test of time today, inclusion of brand new graphics and sound ensures that Impossible Mission is primed to thrill a brand new audience.\n\nThe gamer takes the role of a secret agent attempting to stop evil genius Professor Elvin Atombender who has been tampering with National Security Computers. Players must penetrate Atombender's base, attempting to recover parts of the system password whilst avoiding deadly robots in a race against time.\n\nWhilst the game has been re-written from the ground up and features new graphics, 3D objects, new Sound Effects and Music, the gameplay remains impressively loyal with the game layout changing for every new game. There are now three main characters to choose from plus a brand new tutorial mode. The player can now chose from three game modes, new, original and for the purist; a hybrid mode with the original gameplay using the updated graphics.\n\nThe PSP versions offer an unusual feature which allows players to send a full copy of their game to a friend by Wireless so they can try it for themselves.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co723g.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"System 3 Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":148732,"name":"Muscle Power","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"3D action shooter that protects the world with muscles","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3pg1.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":148733,"name":"12-Sai: Torokeru Puzzle Futari no Harmony","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"12-Sai.
