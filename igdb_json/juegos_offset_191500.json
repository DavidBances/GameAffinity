Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena).\n\nThe game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:\nSpeed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.\n\nSki Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).\n\nDownhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.\n\nShort Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.\n\nSkeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.\n\nSlalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.\n\nAerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a \"click-along\" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses\n\nBobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.\n\nSpeed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.\n\nSnowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.\n\nCross Country:\nThe stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co988j.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":40827,"name":"Iron Soldier 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Iron Soldier 2 is a first-person 3D giant mech game.

Although Tomba is normally restricted to a two-dimensional plane, there are certain points where he can jump or climb onto a new plane. Tomba's main method of attack is to jump on top of enemies to grab them, allowing him to hop around on them before throwing them away. This can also be used to open other objects such as eggs or treasure chests. Tomba is also able to use various projectile weapons such as maces and boomerangs and can swing on branches and poles.\n\nThe game is based around a mission system, where the main character's (Tomba's) skills are employed to complete various tasks. Completion of a mission gives a certain amount of adventure points (AP) which are required for AP boxes which contain food (which gives you AP and restores 1 space of vitality) or items, and you may for example need 50,000 AP to open one. AP is also used to gain access to special places or information later in the game. Not all missions are necessary to progress in the game, however, they are required to achieve full completion. There are 130 events (missions) in the game, many of them rely on other events to be completed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co55st.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":204341,"name":"A.R.S.E.N.A.L.

It was also released on the Sega Saturn.\n\nThis compilation includes the classic games:\n\n- Konami's Boxing (1984):\nA boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option.\n\n- Konami's Ping-Pong (1985):\nFrom Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.\n\n- Hyper Sports 2 (1985):\nThree tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - skeet shooting, archery and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.\n\n- Mopiranger (1985):\nThe peaceful land of the Mopira have been invaded by the Razons. In this platform game you 'll play Mopiranger and you have to save the young Moplits, who have been kidnapped by the dastardly Razons. The levels are build in a maze-like pattern in which you have to find and rescue the young Moplits from the hostile Razons. Using the obstacles present in the game you can block the Razons, but also lock yourself in...\n\n- Antarctic Adventure (1984):\nAs a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France, New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that enable you to fly over those hazards.\n\n- Yie Ar Kung-Fu (1984):\nBased on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong's quest to become a Kung-Fu master. Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy.\n\n- Road Fighter (1985):\nA top view racing game. You have to reach the finish line before time runs out. Don't crash into the wall, cars or trucks. Because if you do you will lose gasoline. You can get additional gasoline by picking up fuel items. Especially avoid the purple cars, they do change lanes! And remember... oil makes road slippery...\n\n- Sky Jaguar (1984):\nVertical shooter. When a weakened and vulnerable Earth is invaded by the vicious Zephyr army, the planet's only hope is a fleet of powerful ships, the Sky Jaguars. It 'll take sharp reflexes and amazing skills to survive the Zephyrians' unrelenting assault... can you last long enough to discover and destroy the enemy's hidden headquarters?\n\n- Gradius (1986):\nThe people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and save them. Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.\n\n- Gofer no Yabou: Episode 2 (1988):\nAlso known as Nemesis 3 - The Eye Of Destruction. Gradius 3 is a vertical scrolling shoot 'm up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.

The other lords have to expand their ranks and defend themselves against the mad zealot.\n\nLords of Magic is a strategy game that combines turn-based exploration and resource management with real-time combat. The player can choose to control any of the lords who oppose Balkoth. Each nation (faith) commanded by a lord has its own specific units. Before engaging in an offensive, the player must liberate a Great Temple for the faith of his/her choice. It is also necessary to build a stronghold, develop the nation's capital city, and recruit troops.\n\nThe troops are led by a champion, representing the \"hero\" of the game. This hero can be either a warrior, a thief, or a mage, possessing the classical advantages and disadvantages of these classes: the warrior is good in close combat, the thief can sabotage enemy armies, and the physically weak mage can cast devastating spells. The isometric combat proceeds in real-time, with an option to simply calculate the result of a battle immediately, depending on the participants' statistics.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2hjt.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":18307,"name":"Vs.","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"True Fighters - True Turf\n\nIn the mean streets of today there's no law, no order.

It was released only in Japan and was also the only one in the series not to feature a Pac-Man game. \nThe limited edition comes in a large box designed to hold all 6 Namco Museum releases as well as a memory card. \n \nIt features 7 titles: \n \n- Dragon Saber (1990): A vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990. It is the sequel to Dragon Spirit, released 3 years earlier. \nSTORY: The human beings have repeated their own foolish history, because of their own desires. And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" \n \n- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. \n \n- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. \nYou control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. \n \n- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. \nThe player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. \n \n- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. \nThe players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. \n \n- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. \nThe player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. \n \n- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. It runs on the Namco System 86 hardware platform and was licensed for US distribution to Atari Games. Set in the 1960s, the player takes the role of a secret agent who must save his female partner from a terrorist organization. \nThe player takes control of Albatross, a member of Interpol's \"Rolling Thunder\" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York. \nAlbatross must travel through two different segments or \"stories\", each comprised of five stages, for a total of ten stages.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rhfo9kscsrrlnfwshas3.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":19148,"name":"SubSpace","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"SubSpace is a 2D space shooter game released by Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE) in 1997.

However, given that Himikogen: Renge was developed by Chime Corporation, it is unlikely that Hakuhodo actually developed Mad Panic Coaster.\n\nIn Mad Panic Coaster, you control a boy and a girl (perhaps a brother and sister?) as they sit in a roller coaster car and go through 15 hellish roller coasters. How these roller coasters even got past safety testing is unknown, as they don't have any rails or barriers of any sort. It's up to you to steer the roller coaster car using the d-pad to make sure it stays on the track. The roller coasters also have various monsters, traps, and jumps to avoid. To do this, you use X to jump. Hitting Square will make the girl throw some sort of yellow ball projectile that explodes at a long range, while hitting Circle will make the boy throw that same type of projectile at a shorter range. Falling off the track or getting hit by something will cost you health, and once you run out, you must start the level all over again. Once you make three laps around the track, a rainbow with the words \"lucky\" form around you as they come to a stop, and you move on to the next level. Every three roller coasters, a boss will be fought after completing the third lap. This boss is similar to the regular enemies, except that they take many more hits to kill. To defeat them, you has to either throw enough projectiles at them or survive another three laps.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ghm.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":13906,"name":"Mahou Gakuen Lunar!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Magical School LUNAR! is technically a remake, but it's practically its own independent story.

Control wise, the game varies from other Capcom fighting games by only having four buttons (two punches and two kicks, which is closer to the SNK game format) rather than the standard six. A player chooses a team of two characters, and fights against another two character team. The actual fights, however, are one-on-one fights, with the partner only participating by being called in when a player has enough 'vigor' for a Team Up attack, done by pressing a punch and kick button of the same pressure. The Team Ups would be some kind of double team attack by the character and partner, or (for most female characters' Team Ups) would heal the main character or give them more vigor. After the end of a round, a player (win or lose) has a choice to fight the next round with the partner from the previous round, or to keep their main character in play. The 'vigor' meter (essentially a super meter) could go up to 9 levels, with Team Ups costing two levels and super moves from a single person all costing one level of vigor. Much like the Marvel vs. Capcom games, launchers can be done that allow air combos to be performed, with all characters having universal low and high launchers.\n\nThe game also had a few defensive techniques.\n\nTardy Counters acted much like Alpha Counters from Street Fighter Alpha, allowing a player to immediately counter-attack from a blocking position. However, the restrictions on Tardy Counters are very lax; any hard normal, special or super attack can be used to Tardy counter (Alpha counters are only limited to certain special moves for each character), and Tardy Counters do not cost any extra vigor to perform (Alpha Counters required at least a level of Super Combo gauge to do).\n\nAttack Cancels allowed a player to cancel an incoming hit simply by timing their own hit with the attack, which would cancel out both attacks (though it does not nullify the remaining hits of a multi-hit move). Also, one additional level of vigor is awarded.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co97h0.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":272036,"name":"Sewage","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This takes place in a Canadian sewer system and end's up at the Parliament Building in Ottawa.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":73207,"name":"Beyond Time","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based on the novel Obelisk by Dr. Judith Kaye Jones.\n\nExplore the extraordinary realm of time travel as the riveting story line unfolds.

The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.\n\nThis version would later get re-released as the expanded \"Event Version\", which added a ranking system, followed by other two \"Event Versions\" released for the Satellaview. Another expanded version of the game, called Sutte Hakkun as well, was released as a Nintendo Power downloadable game, containing many levels left out of the Satellaview broadcast due to the Satellaview 8MB Memory Pak size.

While combat works similar as in Astonishia Story, there are a lot of surprising WRPG influences. In the beginning the main character's class is determined by a catalog of questions, just like in many Ultima games. Then three companions are picked from a variety of classes and typical fantasy races (Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits). Two more slots are available for more characters to join temporarily, or even replace some of the original companions for good.\n\nThe game is much more nonlineal and open ended than most Far Eastern RPGs, every town holds a variety of sidequests, which often rely on character's classes or the party's reputation, which is raised by doing good deeds. On the other hand the game punishes what the writer deemed immoral behavious, taking inspiration once again from Ultima. For a good portion of the game there isn't even a real \"main story\" to follow, that only unfolds after solving many individual tasks. Player decisions often have a deep impact on the outcome of a quest. At one point, for example, the party gets caught by a dragon, but manages to escape, alongside many other prisoners. If the heroes then chose to chase and kill the dragon for its treasure instead of fleeing directly, the dragon escapes, killing all fleeing prisoners on the way. The game is also full of little touches, most notable the party doesn't follow the leader in a straight line like in most JRPGs, but in a losely tied bunch of individuals.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xhk.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":84217,"name":"The Mystery at Greveholm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A point and click adventure game based on the Swedish Christmas Calendar TV-series of the same name.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8iex.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":71483,"name":"Star Warped","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A parody of the Star Wars universe.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/keixco5t6sa9a2uiebi3.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":71362,"name":"Virtual Pool 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Virtual Pool 2 is the second game in the franchise.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7xwk.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":45515,"name":"NASCAR 98","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"NASCAR 98 is a racing simulator video game published and developed by EA Sports and released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation.

Horse Racing (US) or horseracing (UK) is an equestrian sport that has been practiced for millennia. It is inextricably associated with gambling. The common sobriquet for Thoroughbred horse racing is The Sport of Kings.\n\nHorse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: \"flat\" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2008 generated a world-wide market worth around US$115 billion.\n\nJapan conducts more than 21,000 horse races a year in one of three types: flat racing, jump racing (races over hurdles), and Ban'ei Racing (also called Draft Racing).\n\nThere are a total of thirty racetracks in Japan. Ten of these tracks are known as \"central tracks\", where most of Japan's top races are conducted. Races at these ten tracks are conducted by the Japan Racing Association (JRA), which operates under the oversight of the Japanese government. The remaining twenty tracks are operated by municipal racing authorities and run under the affiliation of the National Association of Racing (NAR). Two tracks, Sapporo Racecourse and Chukyo Racecourse, run separate meetings under either JRA or NAR jurisdiction.\n\nPower Stakes Grade 1 is the second game in Tose Software game series featuring the new data of the new season over the previous game. The game again features the 3d engine to watch the race in different camera angles that the player select in the game main menu.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2kuz.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":78577,"name":"Dezaemon 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Technically 4th in the series of shoot'em-up creation games by Athena (1997).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6iqw.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":65450,"name":"Moonlight Syndrome","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Moonlight Syndrome is a horror-themed adventure game developed and published by Human Entertainment for the PlayStation in October 1997.
