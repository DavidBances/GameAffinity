It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series.\n\nGameplay\nBefore starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash.\n\nWhen one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will \"attract\" your star towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad.\n\nWhen not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it.\n\nThere are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it's red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get out of its way. Sometimes these hazards will even revolve around stars.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co525b.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Skip Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49514,"name":"Mineko's Night Market","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mineko‚Äôs Night Market is a narrative-driven, social simulation adventure game that celebrates Japanese culture and invites players to craft whimsical items, eat delicious snacks, and ultimately enjoy all the cats.\n\nMineko's Night Market is a game that celebrates Japanese culture while introducing a heartwarming story about friendship, tradition, and many, many cats.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7589.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Meowza Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Humble Bundle","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":49515,"name":"Fortress Underground","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fortress Underground is a sidescroller in which the player controls a chopper flying through an underground cave facing hostile cannons and units while avoiding a fuel shortage.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pnaissnzngnmlzmo5yr6.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kingsoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore 16"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore Plus/4"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":49516,"name":"Radiation Age","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripci√≥n","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/avk4jqn3fja4txw7iimq.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MJ Bros","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":49517,"name":"Transmuter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Transputer Man is a 1988 C64 shoot 'em up created by Palace Software in the Shoot Em Up Construction Kit, and was distributed as a demo game with that product.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gyzytip822vfewbtahpo.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Codemasters","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":49518,"name":"Card Captor Sakura: Sakura Card-hen - Sakura Card to Tomodachi","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Cardcaptor Sakura card game for Game Boy Advance.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4dpr.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49519,"name":"Cardcaptor Sakura: Sakura Card de Mini-Game","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Cardcaptor Sakura minigame collection for Game Boy Advance.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4duw.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"TDK","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49520,"name":"Card Party","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Card Party is a Japanese card game for the Game Boy Advance.\n\nCard Party is a card game developed by NDCube and published by MediaKite for the Game Boy Advance platform.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature.\n\nThe Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech.\nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map.\n\nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature.

Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen.\n\nKlonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack).\n\nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5b66.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49639,"name":"Goku Mahjong Deluxe: Mirai Senshi 21","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Goku Mahjong Deluxe: Mirai Senshi 21 is a Miscellaneous game, published by Athena, which was released in Japan in 2001.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49640,"name":"Kiss x Kiss: Seirei Gakuen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kiss x Kiss: Seirei Gakuen is a Strategy game, developed by Kamui and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2004.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4tc8.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kamui","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49641,"name":"Cesti to Meigurumi-tachi no Mahou no Bouken: Kisekko Gurumii","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cesti to Meigurumi-tachi no Mahou no Bouken: Kisekko Gurumii is an Adventure game, published by MTO, which was released in Japan in 2003.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6xiw.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49642,"name":"Muscle Ranking: Kimeru!
