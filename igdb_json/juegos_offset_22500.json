To fly your helicopter you keep pressing the fire button to stay airborne and press left to move along the screen. If you stop pressing the fire button then you fall downwards towards the water, if you stop pressing left then your momentum keeps you going until you slowly come to a halt. The race is timed and you start with seventy seconds and this decreases as you race but passing buoys gives you forty extra seconds.\n\nThe other competitors fill the skies and you can avoid them or hit the top of their helicopter which sends them into the water but if you are hit from above then you fall into the sea. You are carrying four fish and every time you hit the water then a whale appears and lifts you onto it's head but at the loss of a fish and if you have no more fish when you hit the water then a shark appears and eats you. Pelicans fly in the air from left to right and if they have a fish in their mouth then when hit gives you the fish and you can carry up to eight. Hit a pelican without a fish and it takes one of yours and if you hit one without carrying any then you hit the water and get eaten once again.\n\nOther creatures to avoid are squids, dodos, and storm clouds which release lightning and if you are hit by any then a fish is lost. If you run out of time then a fish is lost but you are given five seconds to try to reach a buoy. Trees make an appearance and you are unable to pass the leaves and branches so you must fly underneath while avoiding hitting the water. During the race, rafts make an appearance and when landed on give you bonus points for time remaining and competitors passed.

The protagonists will form teams in order to fight through Chaos' armies and find their crystals which will later be used to destroy Chaos. Each character has his own campaign to go through at the end of which a crystal will be collected.\n\nThe game also features a single fight and an arcade mode where the player will be able to choose his fighter and the opponent (opponents are automatically chosen by the game if playing in arcade mode though). All of the character's experience and skills received through the campaign are saved for the other game modes (and vice-versa, for example: if Cloud had a level equal to 12 when completing the campaign, he will also appear to have the same level when viewing him in the character roster in Arcade or Quick Battle mode).\n\nAnother feature is that the items you find during the campaign belong to you, the player. That means you can move items from a character to another. The game also features extra content such as villains, costumes etc. which can be unlocked by using PP. You get such points from each fight and completed campaign.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tzp.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team NINJA","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Koei Tecmo Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix Business Division 4","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":24401,"name":"Stak Bots - Breakout","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Destroy the enemy!

You're required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage.\n\nLike Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it's back to the dogfight.

Approaching enemy ships are small, in the distance, and become larger and move faster as they approach the player. The player controls a fighter at the bottom of the screen, which can only move from side to side. Shots can be fired at a diagonal, as well as straight, by twisting the joystick from side to side. At certain stages, ground targets will appear and can be destroyed by using the \"Burn\" button. The laser disc generated backgrounds are largely non-interactive during game play. They form the backgrounds on which the game is played on. Scenes do work in with the backgrounds, however that is the extent. Some backgrounds appear as they should have elements of interactively, however, were not used in the release of the game. These include scenes where the player is going through an asteroid field and asteroids fly towards the player. Another scene is in the crystal caverns, where there are many obstacles which could have been made to be avoided. These are only two of many scenes which could have had interactive elements. The game may have been decided to have been too hard to play with these background obstacles and computer fighters to play. Hence removing the background interactively to make the game more playable. The game starts with the player in Frald Rancer's home city, then taking off into outer space via a fly-by of the city. The backgrounds are very Sci-Fi and are fantasy themed. They are very interesting, more so than the game. The music from the laser disc also complements the laser disc video very well and makes up for the sometimes annoying, computer generated sounds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/l6lb62g3tmjsf6exkmmo.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Funai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":24506,"name":"Terraguard","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Space shooter","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sa6bxrnwz9uwhqebp4rf.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Creative Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore VIC-20"}]},{"id":24507,"name":"Encounter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"1st person shooter","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kxx9lvrvom4gn7vromao.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Synapse Software Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Novagen","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Novagen","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":24508,"name":"Genesis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tempest clone","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pzpee84kkatwjcwy9tcp.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Datasoft, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":24509,"name":"Zenji","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Let us call the \"Many\" the \"Elements.\" Then let us see that in the vast blackness, beyond the beyond, the Elements assemble around the Source.

The second installment in the Unreal series, it was first published by GT Interactive in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, and later released on the PlayStation 2 by Infogrames, and on the Dreamcast by Secret Level. Players compete in a series of matches of various types, with the general aim of out-killing opponents. The PC version supports multiplayer online or over a local area network. Free expansion packs were released, some of which were bundled with a 2000 re-release: Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition.\n\nThe game is based on the same technology that powered Unreal, but the design of Unreal Tournament shifted the series' focus to competitive multiplayer action. Development took 18 months, and the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal. Unreal Tournament received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the graphics, artificial intelligence and gameplay, although the console ports were noted for having limitations. The game won several awards, and remakes have been attempted by fans. The series has continued with the releases of sequels Unreal Tournament 2003 in 2002, Unreal Tournament 2004 in 2004, and Unreal Tournament 3 in 2007.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co635k.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Epic Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":24725,"name":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
