Each collected droplet gives 5 points; 45 points will get you to the next section; after three sections you will progress to the next increasingly harder level. \nMissing too many droplets will cause the beer glass to slip. Watch out for falling sugar cubes, peanuts, matchsticks and darts - you can only withstand them three times. Also beware of a little green caterpillar who tries to hinder your progress in all manners possible. Help comes in the form of a bell announcing 'happy hour'-mode - making your beer glass invulnerable for a couple of seconds. Another help is a sponge appearing from time to time. Jumping on it cleans all spilled droplets. \nUsers were encouraged to save their highscores on a blank disk and send them, accompanied with a slogan, to Dommelsch.

It has (almost) everything we’ve ever wanted to experience in a game like this – a non-linear campaign, deep tactical gameplay, resource management, destructible environment and a sh*tload of different weapons. The only thing we are sparing for the future (when we have moar moneys) will be role-playing and a dynamic open ended campaign.\n\nTurn-based strategy is a thinking man’s game. You analyze your enemy for weak spots, think your moves ahead and execute them. No matter what is happening, you’ll have the time to think about your next move. Maybe it’s because we are too old to master Counter Strike, or because we suck at quick time events, but nevertheless, we think that this is the way it should be.\n\nEnd State has been under development as a hobbyist project already for a decade and has seen multiple revisions, each being more advanced and more fun than the previous one. While we are targeting a more hardcore audience, the game should still be accessible enough for anyone to learn. We sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy playing it as much as we do.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nTake command of a ragtag mercenary team with multiple characters with custom skill sets and weapons, facing a variety of enemies with different capabilities and weaknesses. Plan your moves in variable terrain that forces you to consider about character positioning. Directional facing matters and characters can peek around the corners. This is important because the “fog of war” only shows what the units actually see.\n\nUse cover for your benefit and aim your shots at specific body parts for different results. Face varying missions with different objectives ranging from planting a tracking device to releasing hostages and the enemy AI will, of course, act according to their separate motives.\n\nManage your team through a non-linear campaign. Recruit mercs, equip them and upgrade their skills as they gain more experience. The campaign is not linear, and in one playthrough you’ll never see everything the game has to offer. We aim to develop a future classic you can enjoy for years to come.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pr2.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Iron Sight","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":77338,"name":"Ad Infinitum","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ad Infinitum is an atmospheric single-player horror game, which puts you into a World War I setting seen through a first-person perspective.

At the beginning of the game, players have the freedom to explore the local area by navigating town with the D-pad and adjusting the screen size using the analog stick. Engage in activities like sword attacks with the \"X\" button and interact with fellow citizens using the \"O\" button. The passage of time occurs naturally, transitioning from day to night as you wander around town.\n\nStanding idly in the middle of town allows you to observe other citizens going about their daily routines. Occasionally, someone may approach your character, initiating a conversation or challenging you to a duel in a basic ring. The player's role is crucial in reflecting the voice of the people to establish a peaceful country. Success in this endeavor can lead to membership in the council or even becoming the chairman. Along the way, players can take on various jobs, learn martial arts to become stronger, and maintain a social life with the diverse inhabitants of Pluto.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5xxm.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":77506,"name":"World Neverland 2-in-1 Portable","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The first two World Neverland games bundled on one UMD or download.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72hl.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":77507,"name":"Keiji J.B.
