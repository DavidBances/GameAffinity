The ships are encased in a sort of \"buckyball\" force-field shield which must be shot first before the ship can be killed. In the next phase, the player would land on the robot space-station by centering the Catastrofighter in between the moving white line and Major Havoc would exit his ship and enter the space-station. The roller-knob controlled left and right character movement and a \"jump\" button permitted the player's character to leap over obstacles. Thus, a minor amount of \"gravity\" interacted with the player. The object was to get to the core of the space-station unmolested and sabotage the reactor. Once the charge was set, the player had to get out, back into the space-ship and MSD (minimum safe distance) before the space-station went critical and exploded. Red arrows lead the players direction in and the word out, also in red, points the direction out. The \"mazes\" get gradually more complicated to navigate in difficulty as the player progresses.

The objective is to avoid being shot by an enemy ship, colliding with any flying object and/or the ground, and destroy all enemy ships without overheating one's laser cannon.\n\nThree waves of fighters attack, alternating with three waves of cruisers.

The fighters pose only the threat of collision, while the cruisers fire on the player's ship. The fighter types are named Swoopers, LTFs (Light Triangular Fighters), and Saucers. The cruisers are called Urbites, Dramites, and Bynites. Each level ends with an asteroid belt, in which an array of asteroids advance on the ship and must be avoided or shot.

It is up to you to protect your home town.\n\nYou fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields.

There is a computerized dealer and two more players (human or computer-controlled), and each one is dealt five cards. The players then take turns either calling or raising a bet (of up to $25) or, if they don't like their cards, they can fold. Once that round of betting is done, players can then choose to discard up to three of their cards in exchange for new ones, in an attempt to make a better hand. Another round of betting then takes place and, after that, all the players that didn't fold must show their cards. Whoever has the highest hand wins all the money in the pot.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/puasrtnp0gaxu1jiblnm.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Zircon International","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Fairchild Channel F"}]},{"id":18604,"name":"Videocart-26: Alien Invasion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this Space Invaders variant, the player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen and fires missiles at incoming alien ships.

Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. Enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.\n\nOnce the Sinistar is completely formed, a digitized voice makes various threatening pronouncements, including \"Beware, I live!,\" \"I hunger, coward!,\" \"I am Sinistar!,\" \"Run! Run! Run!,\" \"Beware, coward!\", \"I hunger!,\" \"Run, coward!,\" and a loud roaring sound. The Sinistar has no weapon attacks, but if it contacts the player's ship while it darts about the playfield, the player's ship will be \"eaten\" and destroyed. A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy a fully built Sinistar, although an incomplete Sinistar can be damaged to slow construction. Each short-range Sinibomb automatically targets the Sinistar when fired, but can be intercepted by a collision with an enemy ship, enemy fire, or a planetoid.\n\nThe player moves from one zone to the next each time he defeats the Sinistar. A sequence of four zones repeats continuously after the first zone. Each is named for the most numerous feature of that zone: Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone (the Void Zone is especially difficult because it has very few planetoids).

Pull it towards you to ascend. Push it away from you to descend. Push right to go right. Push left to go left.

The star fighters will come at you from a variety of angles. It is safer strategy to outmaneuver the ones that come at you from diagonals. They require very sophisticated precision tracking. You will save megajoules by firing at those that come head-on or appear in more easily tracked vertical and horizontal courses. You can take evasive action from a star fighter only by climbing or diving to get the ship completely off-screen. If you go right or left, the fighter will continue to follow you.\n\nThere are five enemy star fighters to protect the ten enemy invasion transports and battle frigates.

There are three skill levels the computer can use, and three different board sizes are available, 6 by 6, 8 by 8, and 10 by 10.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pgf.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mattel Electronics","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Digiplay","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Intellivision"}]},{"id":18818,"name":"Synergy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Synergy is a simple Half-Life 2 Modification (Mod) that enables you to play through the Half-Life 2 series and many other 3rd-party campaigns cooperatively with friends","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3klk.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":18819,"name":"NBA 2K17","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Following the record-breaking launch of NBA 2K16, the NBA 2K franchise continues to stake its claim as the most authentic sports video game with NBA 2K17.
