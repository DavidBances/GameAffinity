The player starts with three ships and after 10,000 points a bonus ship is given. Asteroids appear in waves. The first one has two large ones and the number increases with each new wave.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8xh6.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sinclair ZX81"}]},{"id":319591,"name":"Program Pack 4","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Program Pack 4 is a double games pack that contains:\n\nBreakout: Based on the arcade game where the aim is to remove all the bricks at the top of the screen by moving a bat left or right below and bouncing a ball upwards.

The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers.\n\nElectronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.\n\nThe game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.\n\nForty-three countries have been divided into eleven \"politectonic\" or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.\n\nThese figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.\n\nPp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)\n\nPERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).\n\nFuture shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.\n\nIf you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.\n\nConquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ii4.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Odyssey"},{"id":0,"name":"Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"}]},{"id":45364,"name":"Adventure A: Planet of Death","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are marooned on a strange planet and have to repair your space ship in order to get back home.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7m9l.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Sinclair ZX81"}]},{"id":45354,"name":"Adventure B: Inca Curse","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Released in 1982, Adventure B: Inca Curse is the second in a series of eight\ninteractive fiction adventures made by Artic Computing.

Using a language similar to BASIC, the game offers a surprisingly large number of commands you can use, a wide variety of robots.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7j8a.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":25128,"name":"Computer Quarterback","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Computer Quarterback is a very early American Football simulator.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sej7dkrf24zfq077pfsa.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":25116,"name":"The Miser's House","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This game was first released as Miser for the Commodore PET in 1981.

Based on the colour they have different behaviour and some of them require multiple hits. To finish the stage all aliens have to be defeated. The wave is repeated in every stage, but enemies gradually become faster. Just like in the regular Galaga, the largest enemies can move down and fire a fixed beam that makes the area smaller to move. After a number of stages a Challenge Stage can be accessed with a new pattern. The player receives a bonus there based on the number of kills. You start with three lives.

Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4w0v.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"FM-7"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan Color"},{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":2751,"name":"Galaga","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6njq.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"FM-7"}]},{"id":2727,"name":"Castle Wolfenstein","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Castle Wolfenstein is a slow-paced stealth game set in World War II.

The games' model number are PG-74 for the Tabletop game and PG-92 for the Panorama game. PG in the model number stands for Popeye Game. The Panorama game took and came with two LR44 batteries, while the Tabletop version came with two C batteries. Nintendo manufactured 250,000 versions of both games in America and Europe. It's unknown how many were manufactured in Japan. The game is based on the lucrative Popeye franchise, and in it you control Popeye. Nintendo was known during that era to create games based off on the Popeye franchise.\n\nBrutus has kidnapped Olive, and as Popeye you have to knock him out and punch him into the ocean to save Olive. The directional pad controls Popeye left and right. When Brutus tries to punch your character, move Popeye right to make him avoid the punch, then counter with one of your own. If Brutus move Popeye to the very right hand part of the pier, Popeye can still stay on by moving the control pad right at just the right moments, then counter-attack to move Brutus back to the left. Once Popeye moves Brutus to the very left hand corner of the pier, he will have to attack him a certain amount of times (the exact amount depending on your score) before he punches him into the ocean. In Game B a swordfish will occasionally try and poke Popeye. If it succeeds, then Popeye will move back a bit.\n\nAfter Brutus gets out of the ocean for the third time, Olive, who's at the top tied up, will kick cans of spinach down to Popeye for him to eat. If done so successfully, Popeye will gain so much strength that he knocks Brutus all the way up to the hook at the upper left hand corner. Following that, Popeye goes up to where Olive Ollie is and saves her, thus ending the game. After the game ends, it starts over again. If Popeye misses the Spinach, then he'll have to knock Brutus back into the ocean before she'll be able to kick more spinach down towards him.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3auy.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game & Watch"}]},{"id":66809,"name":"Galactic Invasion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this Galaxian-inspired shooter for the Bally Astrocade, the player controls a cannon that scrolls left and right across the bottom of the screen and shoots at descending enemies.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3uy1.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Bally Astrocade"}]},{"id":24799,"name":"Eastern Front (1941)","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Developed by Chris Crawford and distributed through the Atari Program eXchange (APX).

Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.\n\nDefender was commercially successful, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling arcade game. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7qsm.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":91702,"name":"Helmet","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Helmet is a Game & Watch game that was released in 1981.
