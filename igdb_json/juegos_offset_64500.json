There are riddles closely linked to the scenario which they will need to solve over the course of their adventure: finding and opening passageways, gathering objects and using them wisely.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2tol.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Wanadoo Edition","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":69841,"name":"Titans of Steel: Warring Suns","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/oyhxcfpkdvv9urovclot.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69842,"name":"Big Scale Racing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":69843,"name":"Airport Tycoon 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The third installment of the Airport Tycoon series changes it up.

Gameplay uses the mouse; to move from room to room the player clicks where the cursor becomes an arrow - at the edge of the screen, on the staircase and the secret passageway.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9fp1.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Disney Interactive Victoria","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Disney Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":69886,"name":"V8 Challenge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/peo1s4vp6lqdviww3k0z.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Digital Illusions CE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":69887,"name":"Flight Squadron","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69888,"name":"Space Invaders Anniversary","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Space Invaders Anniversary celebrates the 25th anniversary of the oldest Taito franchise.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gaaijzj8wmvzjpwksk2v.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":69889,"name":"Starship: Invasion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ajnykyzauoim0jqze5ay.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69890,"name":"Savage: The Ultimate Quest for Survival","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Savage: The Ultimate Quest for Survival is a 1996 educational video game by Discovery Channel","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4goj.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Discovery Channel Multimedia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Viridis","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":69891,"name":"I Spy Mystery","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6evo.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":69892,"name":"Napalm: The Crimson Crisis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Napalm: The Crimson Crisis is an real time strategy game for the Amiga, set in an apocalyptic near future where robots have risen against their human masters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7fux.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"PXL computers","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"clickBOOM","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":69893,"name":"Heirs to the Throne","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nong95n9rkgeub6ekxoy.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69894,"name":"Dragon Dice","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3w5w.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69895,"name":"Advance to Boardwalk","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69896,"name":"Sea Strike","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It’s time to take to the open sea and embark in epic battles as you captain a military submarine in Sea Strike: Lord of the Deep!

These marbles are picked up and dropped by the players into funnels leading to a series of rails, switches, traps and other devices which grow more complex as the game progresses. The aim is to ensure that each marble arrives in the bin of the same color as the marble. Players must determine how the marble will travel through the puzzle, and how its journey will change the puzzle for the next marble. When a marble runs over certain sections of the puzzle, the paths may be rerouted or cut off, either temporarily or permanently. For example, if the marble runs over a button, it might hop, skip and jump a diversion that sends the next marble down a different road.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/abjunm5xmylepzt2081v.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Maxis South","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Maxis","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":69995,"name":"Su-27 Flanker: Squadron Commander's Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69996,"name":"Men in Black: Alien Assault","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Men in Black: Alien Assault is a top down action game for mobile phones based on the movie by Columbia Pictures Industries.\n\nAliens are living on Earth, right among the human population.

He waged war against two other powerful monarchs, Yandi and Chiyou, fighting for control over China. After a long time, the power of Yandi was reduced, and Chiyou disappeared, allowing Huangdi to become the emperor. But the war was not over. For centuries and millennia later it continued, taking different shapes - blood, battles and ambitions of warlocks would not end. In the Three Kingdoms era, 3rd century AD, the ancient war was revived once again. And so the seventeen-year-old boy Ji Xuan, proficient in sword fighting, and his older sister Ji Shuang, a master of demon-summoning, found themselves involved in a great conflict that will soon change their lives forever...\n\n\"Huanxiang Sanguozhi\", meaning Fantasy Story of Three Kingdoms, is based on historical events, featuring famous characters from the Three Kingdoms epoch, which became so popular in Asia thanks to Luo Guanzhong's classic novel. But the game gives a different interpretation to the story, involving fictional and supernatural characters and themes that were absent in other adaptations of the saga. The game plays like a traditional Asian RPG. You can set your combat style to be entirely turn-based, or with active time element, like in Final Fantasy games. The battles are viewed from isometric perspective, while navigation through the game world is done from a regular third person view. The enemies are visible in hostile areas, but appear randomly on the world map. The game allows you to choose between three difficulty levels.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5nrx.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nihon Falcom","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Unistar","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"UserJoy Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":70025,"name":"Brian Lara 2007 Pressure Play","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Brian Lara 2007 Pressure Play is the first PSP incarnation of the Codemasters series of Brian Lara cricket games.
