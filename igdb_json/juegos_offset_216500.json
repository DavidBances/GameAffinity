The game's development is guided by our 'C.F.R.F' principle: 'Competitive First, Realism Follows,' which prioritizes competitive elements in gameplay decisions and design.\n\nMoE is designed to be accessible and engaging, avoiding the complex hero abilities or arcade-style power-ups that have infiltrated the genre, and instead emphasizing realistic Special Forces or Counter-Terrorist scenarios that enforce, or dare we say, demand genuine skill. Drawing inspiration from foundational titles like the SWAT and the Rainbow 6 series, as well as classics like Counter-Strike and contemporary games like Escape from Tarkov and Rainbow Six Siege, \"Method of Entry\" taps into a deep well of tactical shooter heritage.\n\nThis project is a response to the competitive community's desire for a streamlined, 5v5 tactical shooter where competitive elements take precedence. Realism is then seamlessly integrated, with attention to weapon dynamics, player movement, environmental design, hit detection, and overall intensity. However, this integration never overshadows MoE’s core competitive mechanics, ensuring a balanced and stable competitive experience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9bj0.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":329361,"name":"Barcode Battler II: Shogaku Ninensei Special Barcode Card - Hell Amb.

Amidst the ensuing chaos and turmoil, a new council of representatives has taken power, supported by the revolutionaries that overthrew the king's regime. This 'grand council' is now in charge of overseeing the reconstruction of the region and establishing a new Pokemon league. But even under this supposed new stability, old fissures remain. Many Telius citizens detest the new government and how it operates and remain loyal to the longstanding traditions of supporting the nobility. This nobility and their soldiers, now on the outside looking in, has adopted the moniker 'Team Royale'. Operating from the shadows, they are a group intent on restoring the region to its former glory days under a new king. So with the region war-torn and divided, how will Telius move into the future? Enter YOU the player: the child of a noble family, you were sent away before the war began.
