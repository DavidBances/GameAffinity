If it had been released before Midway Games' Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed, it would have been the first officially licensed indoor american football game by the Arena Football League. Adopting the more faster and frantic style of play from the sport compared to american football, players would have the choice of playing across any of the game modes available against with either CPU-controlled opponents or other players, while including all the rules and teams from the 1995 Arena Football League season including the Miami Hooters, who make their only game appearance in the title and were not included in Electronic Arts' Arena Football. Originally conceived in 1993, the game was announced in early 1994 and showcased at SCES '94 but the project would be later cancelled in 1995 after various delays and expenses, despite being close to completion. Although unreleased, a playable prototype has since been released and sold online by independent groups such as the defunct Jaguar Sector II website and later B&C Computervisions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co76qy.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari Jaguar"}]},{"id":270268,"name":"Brett Hull NHL Hockey","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Brett Hull NHL Hockey is an unfinished game for the Atari Jaguar.

Most of the rules from the sport are present in the title, though they can be disabled from the menu and in-game options. Some of the gameplay options found within the game include an exhibition match, regular season and playoff competitions, among other modes of play. The announcer, Al Michaels, makes commentary during gameplay and announces Brett Hull by name but other players are only called by their respective jersey number due to the lack of the NHL license, while his commentaries can also be turned off on the options menu. Season progress is only kept via password and there is also a two-player option for every mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7xjr.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari Jaguar"}]},{"id":270264,"name":"Rocky & Bullwinkle","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An unreleased Intellivision game from 1983.\n\nMath mode to this game. \"Rocky and Bullwinkle must stop the evil Boris and Natasha from robbing a train full of priceless valuables.
