One follows a standard RPG route of a hero's journey, another involves the princess of the kingdom of demons as she attempts to uncover an attack on her father's throne with a band of allied monsters, and the third involves a thief who steals money from monsters and gives it to beggars. Each campaign follows the core gameplay of the series: overworld exploration and turn-based combat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6xhw.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":186961,"name":"Momotaro Densetsu Gaiden","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Family Computer port of the Game Boy game under the name of Momotaro Densetsu Gaiden.
