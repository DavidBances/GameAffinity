It is similar to the Gran Turismo series except for the role-playing game elements. The game was lauded for having artificial intelligence superior to Gran Turismo 4. When compared to Gran Turismo 4, Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano has far fewer cars and tracks. All the cars in the game are manufactured by the Alfa Romeo motor company. While most of the tracks are in Italy, a few are in other countries like Germany and the United States. A distinguishing feature of the game is that it models driver development using a system almost identical to a role-playing video game. In addition, cars get damaged, both visibly and in performance, by collisions or by driving off course.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6pxk.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Valcon Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Black Bean Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Milestone","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":5722,"name":"America's Army: Rise of a Soldier","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"America's Army: Rise of a Soldier is the Xbox version of the tactical first-person shooter developed in conjunction with the US Army.

With the focus more on coaching instead of playing with big-name stars, COLLEGE HOOPS 2K6 puts the player in charge of an NCAA team of their own. Gamers can select from nearly every NCAA coach currently in the industry or create their own. Each coach has a number of different attributes, and these attributes will determine many different aspects of the game. Charisma, for example, affects recruitment and player confidence, while discipline will help players focus on the game. Players may also bring issues to the coach to solve, which also affects the team's playing ability as well. Gamers will also have access to the coach's clipboard during the game. The clipboard will pop up automatically when gamers need to make adjustments instead of requiring gamers to access a series of menus. Another new feature are the four points of emphasis: ball control, defense, rebounding, and shot selection. Selecting one will boast the team's particular effectiveness in that area proportionate to the coach's attributes. Recruiting, likewise, has been upgraded and tweaked. Gamers can track 15 potential recruits during the season, watching their interest levels and stats and have the option of controlling the recruiting themselves or allowing the assistant coaches to deal many of the decisions. COLLEGE HOOPS 2K6 perfectly captures all of the aspects of coaching a NCAA team but, with assistant coaches and other options, never makes the gamer feel overwhelmed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4b2g.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Concepts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Sports","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":5783,"name":"College Hoops 2K7","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"College Hoops 2K7 was the 5th installation of 2K Sports' popular College Hoops line of College Basketball Games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4xhy.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Concepts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Sports","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":5784,"name":"Combat Elite: WWII Paratroopers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Supported by an army of more than 17,000 US and British paratroopers, you must stop the Nazis from occupying Europe during WWII.

In the park, the player builds paths, amenities for visitors such as food, restrooms, enclosures, and attractions. One must also keep the park safe and secure.\n\nThe park can be populated with up to sixty dinosaurs, with twenty-five different species available from the three Jurassic Park films. The player can also add attractions similar to those seen in the films, such as the safari seen in the Jurassic Park film, and additional attractions such as a balloon tour and several varieties of viewing platform.\n\nWhile the PlayStation 2 version is fairly common, the PC and Xbox versions of the game are considerably rare, with the Xbox version considered one of the rarest and most expensive titles for the system, with copies of the game often selling on eBay for upwards of $100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player's main objective is to create a theme park/zoo featuring dinosaurs, make it popular, and make it safe with a 5-star rating. Gameplay functions are very similar to the SimCity and Tycoon game models. It is necessary to build feeding stations where herbivores can get bales of plant feed, while carnivores are fed live cows or goats. However, herbivores become unhappy if they don't have enough trees around them or enough nearby dinosaurs to socialize with. Likewise, carnivores have an innate desire to hunt other dinosaurs, so even a constant stream of livestock will not keep them happy.\n\nTo create a dinosaur, fifty percent (50%) of the particular dinosaur's DNA is needed. The higher the percentage of DNA, the longer that dinosaur will live, unless it dies by means other than natural causes, such as malnutrition or being attacked by another dinosaur. To obtain a dinosaur's DNA, the player must extract it through fossils or amber. Higher quality specimens will yield more DNA.\n\nTo obtain fossils and amber, the player must send a fossil-hunting team to dig in one of nine dig sites around the world. Additional dig teams can be purchased later in the game. Each dig site contains fossils from three particular dinosaurs. Fossils of some dinosaurs, such as Brachiosaurus, can be found in more than one dig site. The chance of finding fossils depends on the quality of the site. There are 6 classifications on the quality of a dig site, ranging from \"excellent\" to \"exhausted.\" It is still possible to find fossils and amber at sites that have been exhausted, although they are often of low quality with little DNA to provide. Valuable items such as silver, gold, or opal are also discovered infrequently by the dig team(s), and can be sold for profit.\n\nAttractions help make the park popular, and increase its rating power and income when correctly configured. Attractions must be researched before they can be constructed, and include the Balloon Tour, Safari Adventure and Viewing Dome. Viewing Vents and Viewing Platforms do not need to be researched. The Safari Tour and Balloon Tour attractions allow for the player to \"take over\" the ride for the purpose of park exploration and photography, but only when a visitor in the game is using it. The player may also observe the dinosaurs from the Viewing Dome, Viewing Vent, and Viewing Platform by selecting the \"View\" option after clicking on the building.\n\nAmenities such as restrooms and restaurants are needed for visitors. Additional buildings such as a gift shop and a resting area must be researched before the player can add them into the park. Vaccines for diseases–such as tick infestation, gastric poisoning, rabies, and the fictional Dino Flu–must be researched before a sick dinosaur can be treated for a particular illness.\n\nDINOSAURS:\nThere are a total of 25 dinosaurs featured in the game, some of which were featured in the films. They are divided into four main sub-groups. Small Herbivores such as Gallimimus and Pachycephalosaurus are easy to care for and do not take up much space, but are not as popular with guests. Large Herbivores such as Brachiosaurus and Triceratops are very popular with visitors and do not require expensive fences, but need large spacious exhibits.\n\nSmall Carnivores such as Dilophosaurus and Velociraptor do not generally need vigorous security as their larger counterparts, but can still harm guests if they escape. Large Carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus are the most popular dinosaurs in the game, but require large exhibits with high security fences and are prone to rampaging when stressed.\n\nMISSIONS:\nThe game has 10 missions the player can complete. In some websites like IGN and GameSpot, early previews indicated that there were originally to be 12 missions. There are about three or four general types of missions, including taking photographs of dinosaurs to try to rack up a certain amount of points from the photos in a safari mission and dinosaur control missions where the player has to retire the carnivores (preferably large ones) to protect the herbivores.\n\nSITE B:\nAfter all the missions are completed, the \"Site B\" mode is unlocked, which allows the player to create an island without any fences or buildings for people, similar to Isla Sorna in The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. Visitors are not allowed on the island. The player can place up to eight hatcheries and create up to sixty dinosaurs, which live on the island without diseases or the possibility of becoming stressed. As long as they have food, water and living space, the player can simply watch the dinosaurs interact and live out their lives.\n\nFAN MODIFICATIONS:\nBecause of the PC version's modular file structure, the game is very easy to modify with nothing more than a regular text editor. It is possible to create almost completely new missions, exercises, dinosaurs, dinosaur designs, new visitor appearances, and play options. The Indominus rex, a genetic hybrid dinosaur from Jurassic World, was made available in June 2015.\n\nThanks to the open ended design, a small community of fans have come together to improve realism, unlock unreleased features, and design new features to be included. A group of people have formed the Community Expansion Project and the Genesis Expansion Project, which takes previous modifications and designs new ones for release in a patch for the overall community.\n\nThe team's main aim is to recreate the dinosaurs to be as realistic as possible, mainly expanding and creating new behavior. Two other modification sets, the Film-Canon Mod (FCM) and Novel-Canon Mod (NCM), are from Jurassic Park fansite, JPLegacy.org. The NCM includes dinosaur designs and islands based on the Jurassic Park novels. The FCM includes film-based dinosaur designs, music, sounds, and islands. Since the release of the first expansions, many others have appeared, with increased sophistication to make the game more realistic.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30ji.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Blue Tongue Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Universal Interactive Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"}]},{"id":5872,"name":"Justice League Heroes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Justice League Heroes is a console video game for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation Portable systems.

Battle and conquest are also important ingredients in a pirate's lifestyle and combat takes place both on land and on the high seas. The player's character is quick with a sword and can increase her swashbuckling skills with experience.\n\nSimilarly, wealth gained from adventure and victory allows the pirate to upgrade to larger ships with more deadly weaponry. A dozen unique fighting vessels will become available to skilled captains, along with special accoutrements that afford the ships extra powers. Sea battles involve a realistic combination of positioning and timing, as tall ships align themselves to fire on enemy vessels from port- and starboard-mounted weapons and time must be spent reloading the powerful cannons and guns after each shot. The ability to repair damage on the fly is also an important strategic consideration in ship-to-ship fights.\n\nThough the gameplay of this 3D adventure is oriented towards fast action, several elements of role-playing are also incorporated, to move the story along and involve the player more deeply. The lead character Katarina de Leon plots a thoughtful course for her career on the open seas. The \"Black Kat\" sets sail to uncover mysteries and position herself in circumstances that will increase her overall status among other pirates, securing a position of power.

It is essentially a mix between two Namco games; Pac-Man and Rally X. \n \nIt is the sequel to Head-On, which was released a year before Puck-Man. However, Pacar is more-so a clone of Puck-Man than a true Head-On sequel. \n \nThe player controls \"Pacar\", a \"mischievous\" green car through a maze of roads. The objective of the game is to \"delete\" all of the small red \"dots\" scattered around the playfield, building up points for a high score. The joystick allows Pacar to move in the proposed direction, assuming it is possible to do so. Like Pac-Man, Pacar does not stop moving unless it hits a wall, however unlike Pac-Man, it is not possible to rotate 180 degrees on the spot - moving in the opposite direction causes Pacar to reverse, and reversing is significantly slower than driving normally. Ideally the player should plan his or her route to avoid reversing altogether. \n \n1 or 2 allows Pacar to move faster across the board. Driving off the edge of the screen makes Pacar appear at the other side, again similar to Pac-Man. \n \nThe game has Pacar avoid two types of enemy, also depicted as cars. Blue cars spawn from the garage at the centre of the screen and wander around the play area, only following Pacar if it is close by. Red cars spawn randomly on the road behind Pacar, and are much more aggressive with their tactics. Red cars also differ in that if Pacar speeds up, they will also increase their speed. If either car crashes into Pacar under normal conditions, the player loses a life. \n \nUnder certain conditions the game's equivalent of Pac Man's power pellets appear after deleting smaller dots. These give Pacar \"temporary invincibility\" turning it purple in the process, and act as the only form of attack against oppoents. While purple, the player is free to crash into as many cars as he or she likes, and is granted extra points in the process (starting at 200 and doubling for each successive hit, i.e. 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 etc.). It will also slow down red cars. Though there are typically fewer enemies on-screen in Pacar than Pac-Man, the fact that blue cars spawn from the garage instantly after being deleted means it is possible to achieve much higher point combos. \n \nThere are only two maps in Pacar, which cycle endlessly until the player dies. The game claims it is \"three dimensional\" as some roads in map 1 act as bridges over other roads. Once both maps are completed the player proceeds to the next \"round\", in which more blue cars are added to the playfield (with the exception of round 4, in which the three \"normal\" blue cars are replaced with one faster blue car. Round 5 will then add a second faster car and so on). \n \nExtra lives are awarded every 10,000 points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s22blbmsivtcforiqfvp.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"SG-1000"}]},{"id":6123,"name":"Pachinko","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Press 1 on the alpha-numeric keyboard. \n \nA giant Pachinko game appears on your TV.

A direct hit on the nozzle will destroy the SUPER TANK, bringing the players to another more intricate collection round where the challenges are greater and so are the rewards.\n\nOddly enough, the German and Japanese versions of the game’s flyer depict a flower-laden, treaded vehicle with the head and body of a Roman gentleman, much like a centaur. This vehicle is shown shooting water at other similar vehicles out of his elongated nose. It is thought that restrictions against war games and cultural standards were responsible for these gentle depictions of the military-themed action in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7e8k.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"SG-1000"}]},{"id":6142,"name":"Risen 3: Titan Lords","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The world of Risen 3 is abandoned by all gods and suffers from the Titan Wars when a new threat rises from the soil.
