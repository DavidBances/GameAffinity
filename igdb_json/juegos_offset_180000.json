As the story develops, more is revealed about Jen's past and her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as the nature of the demon worlds.\n\nIn Primal, the player can control either Jen or Scree as they navigate the realms of Oblivion. As the game progresses, newer demonic forms are obtained, which prove invaluable in solving various puzzles and combat.\n\nControl can be switched between Jen and Scree at any time in game. When in control of one, the other will be operated by AI, performing various functions depending on the situation. During play, the characters can interact with one another, performing actions such as asking questions, or siphoning energy.\n\nWhen in control of Jen, the player may transform into one of four demonic forms for various purposes, depending on the situation (provided the forms are unlocked). When in a demon form, Jen experiences a boost in attack, defense, speed, attack range and access to abilities unavailable in a human form. The tattoo on Jen's back also glows when in a demon form, corresponding to various forms.\n\nDefeating enemies involves weakening enemies to the point where their hit points reach zero, at which time a finishing move must be performed to kill the enemy. While the moves differ in style and time taken, the final effect remains the same. Enemies can be finished off before the health bar reaches zero, and doing so leaves more residual energy.\n\nWhile Jen can remain in a demonic form indefinitely, taking damage will reduce health. However, hit points here are represented by demonic energy. When an enemy is killed, the remaining energy can be drained through use of Scree, who can store the energy for when it is needed. Jen can then call on the energy, siphoning it off to replenish her own. Scree can store a vast amount of energy, but also has limits as to how much.\n\nWhen in control of Scree, the player is invulnerable; Scree, being a gargoyle, cannot suffer damage, making him an effective scout. Scree is capable of climbing on stone walls, a necessary ability when traversing the realms. Scree can also store drained energy from dead enemies, which can be used to replenish Jen's demonic health, though he must remain immobile when doing so.\n\nScree is revealed to be the long-lost Abdizur, who disappeared following an encounter with the lord of Chaos. In Solus, for a temporary amount of time, the player possesses a life-size statue of Abdizur via Scree, to combat Belhazur when Jen's powers are not fit to do so. The player may also possess other statues in an area under given circumstances.\n\nThe player may also happen across various energy crystals, which can be stored and used if Scree's energy reserves are not enough and the player is at low health. These crystals are kept throughout the game, the only exclusion being when revisiting previous scenes, at which point they are reduced to a default amount. This means that the crystals function as extra lives, to a degree.\n\nIf Jen is in human form, her health replenishes automatically if she is not in battle (human form only; demon energy must be replenished by either drawing on Scree's reserve energy or, failing that, by using a crystal). While in human form, Jen's health represents her presence in the demon world. If she loses all her health while in human form, she is returned to the human world, where she is in a near-death state. When this happens, the player must direct Scree to the nearest rift gate within a time limit (not seen on screen, though the voice of Arella warns the player that time is running out). If Scree does not reach a rift gate in time, Jen dies, and the game is over.\n\nThroughout the game, constant saving can prove onerous, particularly if the player wishes to backtrack and revisit certain areas. Provided a save game is present, the player may do so, and can revisit nearly all of the locations, once they have been unlocked via an in-game cutscene.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1oye.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SCE Cambridge Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":2822,"name":"Samurai Jack: The Amulet of Time","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Samurai Jack is a warrior who is banished by the shape-shifting wizard Aku into the bizarre and twisted future.

The first two were the non-sibling relation and siblings-together ending and, if the player chooses one sister in the beginning but ends up with another sister, either of the other two endings for the first sister who the player does not choose appear (\"non-blood relation\" ending and \"still brother and sister forever\" ending also) but with a different story.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co714k.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":49849,"name":"Tennis no Ouji-sama 2003: Cool Blue","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tennis no Ouji-sama 2003 is a Sports game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2003.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co90zn.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49848,"name":"Tennis no Ouji-sama 2003: Passion Red","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tennis no Ouji-sama 2003 is a Sports game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2003.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co90zo.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49379,"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!

Like its two immediate predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the combat field.

The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg, but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party.

In the park, the player builds paths, amenities for visitors such as food, restrooms, enclosures, and attractions. One must also keep the park safe and secure.\n\nThe park can be populated with up to sixty dinosaurs, with twenty-five different species available from the three Jurassic Park films. The player can also add attractions similar to those seen in the films, such as the safari seen in the Jurassic Park film, and additional attractions such as a balloon tour and several varieties of viewing platform.\n\nWhile the PlayStation 2 version is fairly common, the PC and Xbox versions of the game are considerably rare, with the Xbox version considered one of the rarest and most expensive titles for the system, with copies of the game often selling on eBay for upwards of $100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player's main objective is to create a theme park/zoo featuring dinosaurs, make it popular, and make it safe with a 5-star rating. Gameplay functions are very similar to the SimCity and Tycoon game models. It is necessary to build feeding stations where herbivores can get bales of plant feed, while carnivores are fed live cows or goats. However, herbivores become unhappy if they don't have enough trees around them or enough nearby dinosaurs to socialize with. Likewise, carnivores have an innate desire to hunt other dinosaurs, so even a constant stream of livestock will not keep them happy.\n\nTo create a dinosaur, fifty percent (50%) of the particular dinosaur's DNA is needed. The higher the percentage of DNA, the longer that dinosaur will live, unless it dies by means other than natural causes, such as malnutrition or being attacked by another dinosaur. To obtain a dinosaur's DNA, the player must extract it through fossils or amber. Higher quality specimens will yield more DNA.\n\nTo obtain fossils and amber, the player must send a fossil-hunting team to dig in one of nine dig sites around the world. Additional dig teams can be purchased later in the game. Each dig site contains fossils from three particular dinosaurs. Fossils of some dinosaurs, such as Brachiosaurus, can be found in more than one dig site. The chance of finding fossils depends on the quality of the site. There are 6 classifications on the quality of a dig site, ranging from \"excellent\" to \"exhausted.\" It is still possible to find fossils and amber at sites that have been exhausted, although they are often of low quality with little DNA to provide. Valuable items such as silver, gold, or opal are also discovered infrequently by the dig team(s), and can be sold for profit.\n\nAttractions help make the park popular, and increase its rating power and income when correctly configured. Attractions must be researched before they can be constructed, and include the Balloon Tour, Safari Adventure and Viewing Dome. Viewing Vents and Viewing Platforms do not need to be researched. The Safari Tour and Balloon Tour attractions allow for the player to \"take over\" the ride for the purpose of park exploration and photography, but only when a visitor in the game is using it. The player may also observe the dinosaurs from the Viewing Dome, Viewing Vent, and Viewing Platform by selecting the \"View\" option after clicking on the building.\n\nAmenities such as restrooms and restaurants are needed for visitors. Additional buildings such as a gift shop and a resting area must be researched before the player can add them into the park. Vaccines for diseases–such as tick infestation, gastric poisoning, rabies, and the fictional Dino Flu–must be researched before a sick dinosaur can be treated for a particular illness.\n\nDINOSAURS:\nThere are a total of 25 dinosaurs featured in the game, some of which were featured in the films. They are divided into four main sub-groups. Small Herbivores such as Gallimimus and Pachycephalosaurus are easy to care for and do not take up much space, but are not as popular with guests. Large Herbivores such as Brachiosaurus and Triceratops are very popular with visitors and do not require expensive fences, but need large spacious exhibits.\n\nSmall Carnivores such as Dilophosaurus and Velociraptor do not generally need vigorous security as their larger counterparts, but can still harm guests if they escape. Large Carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus are the most popular dinosaurs in the game, but require large exhibits with high security fences and are prone to rampaging when stressed.\n\nMISSIONS:\nThe game has 10 missions the player can complete. In some websites like IGN and GameSpot, early previews indicated that there were originally to be 12 missions. There are about three or four general types of missions, including taking photographs of dinosaurs to try to rack up a certain amount of points from the photos in a safari mission and dinosaur control missions where the player has to retire the carnivores (preferably large ones) to protect the herbivores.\n\nSITE B:\nAfter all the missions are completed, the \"Site B\" mode is unlocked, which allows the player to create an island without any fences or buildings for people, similar to Isla Sorna in The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. Visitors are not allowed on the island. The player can place up to eight hatcheries and create up to sixty dinosaurs, which live on the island without diseases or the possibility of becoming stressed. As long as they have food, water and living space, the player can simply watch the dinosaurs interact and live out their lives.\n\nFAN MODIFICATIONS:\nBecause of the PC version's modular file structure, the game is very easy to modify with nothing more than a regular text editor. It is possible to create almost completely new missions, exercises, dinosaurs, dinosaur designs, new visitor appearances, and play options. The Indominus rex, a genetic hybrid dinosaur from Jurassic World, was made available in June 2015.\n\nThanks to the open ended design, a small community of fans have come together to improve realism, unlock unreleased features, and design new features to be included. A group of people have formed the Community Expansion Project and the Genesis Expansion Project, which takes previous modifications and designs new ones for release in a patch for the overall community.\n\nThe team's main aim is to recreate the dinosaurs to be as realistic as possible, mainly expanding and creating new behavior. Two other modification sets, the Film-Canon Mod (FCM) and Novel-Canon Mod (NCM), are from Jurassic Park fansite, JPLegacy.org. The NCM includes dinosaur designs and islands based on the Jurassic Park novels. The FCM includes film-based dinosaur designs, music, sounds, and islands. Since the release of the first expansions, many others have appeared, with increased sophistication to make the game more realistic.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30ji.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Blue Tongue Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Universal Interactive Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":19306,"name":"My Street","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gamers of all ages will enjoy the varied puzzle games, board games and other multiplayer party-style competitions in My Street for PlayStation 2.

A handful of colonists struck out on their own to begin anew - far away from the Earth and its turmoil. Several ships were launched with enough equipment and supplies to give the hundreds onboard a fighting chance - but since the area around far-off Sirius had never been surveyed, no one really knew what to expect. What they found was a new frontier of free-flowing natural resources, unexplored territories, great wonders and lurking dangers. Each ship, representing the clusters of people and their earthly place of origin, settled into different parts of the galaxy pre-selected by their ship-board computer to give them the best chance of survival.\n\nLife was hard in the beginning, but over the 800 years the different colonies prospered and expanded their territories, claiming more and more systems for their own. Survival and propagation eventually led to growth and profit as each of the colonies developed specialties and fostered commerce. As the colonies grew and time passed their connections with their roots on Earth dwindled and they lost their memories of the conflicts of the past. Soon their attention was dominated by new, more immediate conflicts. Feelings of lost ancestral connection spurred anachronism in the look of the great cities, and created a somewhat distorted image of each colony's cultural heritage. In the ever-expanding outer edge of the territories, frontier lawlessness prevailed.\n\nThe Houses: Each shipboard colony that left Earth carried some memory of its origins in its name. The Liberty carried Americans, The Bretonia flew from The United Kingdom and surrounding territory, The Kusari from Asia, and the Rheinland launched with Germanic cargo.\n\nAs each ship settled and colonies began to expand, they knew little about each other and their advancing development. Finally, little by little, the individual colonies found each other and began to set up trade routes to link their systems for commerce and solidarity.\n\nToday, with each colony firmly rooted in its respective corner of the galaxy, the colonies rely heavily on each other for trade and industry but also compete for resources and new territories in the Border Worlds. The colonies mandate member governments in \"The New Alliance\" within the Sirius sector. To control conflicts, each colony has forged alliances and treaties with others as they have grown. Competition remains fierce, however. Struggles rage for supremacy in business, commerce, resources, power and control. There can be tenuous peace between colonies' political agendas, but the grabs for holdings constantly unsettle the volatile frontier.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ibd.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Digital Anvil","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":323553,"name":"Lamb to the Slaughter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co939n.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":46625,"name":"Unreal II: The Awakening - Special Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Unreal adventure continues with the release of the action shooter Unreal II: The Awakening.

There is also another game mode called Flood, which involves fending off waves of demons and sealing the gates through which they come. This is primarily a multiplayer mode, but it can also be played with friendly bots.\n\nThe game's setting has strong medieval fantasy motives. The eight weapons at the player's disposal either come from a medieval arsenal (dagger, crossbow, sword) or are various holy spells like Smite and Trinity Blast which are powered by manna. Essentially, most weapons function similarly to those of Quake. However, each also has an alternate firing mode that can be toggled at any time. Alternate attacks deal more damage at the cost of increased ammo consumption.\n\nThe monsters also have medieval fantasy designs, sometimes reminiscent of Heretic or Hexen. These include zombies, levitating necromancers and various humanoid fighters in medieval attire. Many of the enemies have special abilities and alternate attacks, making them even more dangerous.\n\nOne special feature unique to Eternal War is the player's ability to pray, which allows Mike to regain full health. It is not possible to fight while praying, but the player is surrounded by an aura that will banish any demons that might try to attack him.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3jeg.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Two Guys Software, Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":66396,"name":"Space Station 13","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Space Station 13 (ss13) is a multiplayer role-playing game.

This began his lifelong fascination with video games and computers. Even though the family had an Atari 2600, Ryan and his brothers were drawn to the Intellivision and its more complex games. \n \nBy 1992, the family Intellivision had long since died, but Ryan started to discover that thrift stores and garage sales were loaded with old video games. For little money, he was able to build what a decade earlier would've been the video game collection of any kid's dreams. Ryan had become an Intellivision fanatic again. \n \nAs we rolled into the new millennium, the feasibility of programming the Intellivision became possible. A handful of individuals managed to create compilers, emulators, documentation, and development hardware of the Intellivision. Ryan's attention was peaked in 2000 when Joe Zbiciak programmed an entirely new game, 4-Tris, and then managed to build and sell it as a complete package. \n \nIn 2002 Ryan found a lot of spare time to start dabbling with Intellivision programming. After experimenting with a variety of \"Hello World\" programs and learning the various features of the Intellivision one by one, Ryan adopted a Minesweeper clone as the theme of his first full game attempt. \n \nRyan chose to do MineHunter for the following reasons: \n \n1) MineHunter is a proven concept. Creating an entirely new game concept is always a risky venture and requires a greater investment of time. (This is why you see so many clones of popular games.) \n \n2) MineHunter is not very difficult to program since it requires little or no animation. (This belief changed when Ryan added the explosion routine.) \n \n3) The game concept had always been a favorite of him. Every time he came across it, he would find himself addicted again. \n \n4) MineHunter is well suited for the Intellivision's display capabilities. MindStrike for the Intellivision ECS proved that it's feasible to make a screen full of numbers look good. \n \n \nThe majority of MineHunter was programmed over the course of about 9 months from mid 2002 to early 2003. The game was about 95% finished when suddenly all of Ryan's free time had disappeared. In addition, his interest in programming the Intellivision was starting to wane due to realization that it may be impossible to ever build and sell games. Some brief research showed Ryan that building actual cartridges and producing the associated manuals, boxes, and overlays would be insanely expensive and require an immense amount of time. \n \nRyan's Intellivision programming work was falling farther and farther to the backburner when in late 2003 he was approached by the Chris Neiman and David Harley about the possibility of making MineHunter into an actual cartridge. Over 2003 and 2004 they put a lot of effort, research and investment into working out a plan that would allow for the production of new games to be published just like the originals were 20 years ago. Their efforts encouraged him to complete the programming of MineHunter in 2004.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pid.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Intellivision"}]},{"id":10491,"name":"Konung 2: Blood of Titans","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Konung 2 is a sequel to Konung: The Legend of North.

Scores and medals (gold, silver, or bronze) are based on the amount of time it takes to complete a mission, and mission replay videos are available at the touch of a button. Other features include two difficulty settings, easy and expert (which factors damage and wind into the challenge), three camera angles, and a free flight mode using maps unlocked in successful missions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cu45km5too5vhnzzve6p.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":138359,"name":"Disney Hotshots Arcade Frenzy: Mushoot / Rooftop Ruckus","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Disney's Arcade Frenzy, one of your jobs is to help Mushu the dragon defend a Chinese village by shooting fireworks to stop the advance of the evil Huns. \n \nMushoot is a compelling game and you have plenty of weapons at your disposal as the Huns come over the hills towards you. If you use your right mouse button you can launch an avalanche rocket. And for every enemy you send scurrying back, you get bonus points. All the time, the dragon urges you on like an enthusiastic football coach, cracking jokes and celebrating the hits. He is desperate to fend off the \"creepy Huns\". Mushoot is an addictive game which is simple to play and it is likely to appeal to all ages. \n \nIn the second game, Rooftop Ruckus, you join the sharp-tongued monkey Abu and leap across rooftops putting on lights. It's a high-speed chase and you have to watch out for the evil genie who comes running after you. The instructions are clear and the animation is excellent. The characters are very engaging and complain if you leave the game too early. Anyone who enjoyed the movie Aladdin will find this game fun and entertaining. You are awarded extra points for picking up bags of gold or for making guards slip. \n \nBoth games can be played solo or with friends and they will appeal to beginners and experts.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Avanquest Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]}]
