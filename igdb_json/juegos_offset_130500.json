It was originally created as a ZX Spectrum title for the Yandex Retro Games Battle 2019 where it took third place. Later it was ported to other platforms. It consists of several levels, mostly a single screen with slight scrolling near the edges, where a gold digger needs to collect all the gold bars in the environment to complete the level. As soon as all gold is collected the level ends right away.\n\nEach level represents a room in a mansion, with several platforms, ladders and hazards such as fire. There are enemies moving over the platforms and they are able to use ladders. There are free-roaming flying creatures as well. A single encounter with an enemy or a hazard is immediately deadly and makes the level restart. There are no ways to attack the enemies, they can only be avoided.\n\nA lot of the gameplay revolves around luring the enemies away in a certain direction so you can pass and grab the gold on the other side. There are platforms where it is possible to drop down through them right away. Certain pieces of gold can only be reached through digging. Pickaxes can be picked up in certain levels and they allow the character to dig down once per axe. Other game elements are bridges that can be activated and timed explosions that can be triggered to clear a part of then environment.

Since ancient times, fabulous creatures goblin, kikimors, swamp spirits and many others have always helped ordinary wanderers and heroes. They gave them gifts in every possible way and supported them in their development. And there was an idyll between people and creatures, everyone lived in peace and harmony. But over time, more and more people began to be attracted and interested in the wealth of fairy-tale heroes. Because of human greed and cruelty, the first disagreements arose. People began to enslave creatures with impunity. Greed and lust for profit overshadowed their minds. And then Perun decided to protect the creatures from people and endowed them with incredible strength and abilities to protect humans from the misfortune. He split the old world and created several new ones, scattered riches over unknown distances, which the creatures reliably guarded. \n \nThe strategic component of the game is determined by two main conditions: \n1. There are two types of interaction between players in the game. Either the player becomes a prince and develops by capturing and surrounding locations belonging to other players, or he becomes a fiefdom and at these locations is mining items and materials. In fact, this is a symbiosis, some players are engaged in mining, others protect them by receiving profit from them, while they jointly expand their possessions by spreading their influence to other principalities and cities. The mechanics of capturing and surrounding locations is a separate game, reminiscent of a game of \"dots\" on a large spherical world with a size of 25,000 hexagons. \n \n \n2. Players, through close social interaction, identify leaders who are appointed to govern cities and states as a whole. Such players, while occupying positions, have mechanisms at their disposal to manage the economy of the game. They also develop a strategy for the development of the state as a whole, dictating foreign and domestic policies and the conditions for the existence of the players themselves in it. Such appointments occur weekly, so the dynamics of development in the game depends entirely on the correctness of the actions of the gaming community, as well as on the insight and wisdom of the rulers. \n \nIn the game, the strategy is the main point, however, in addition to this, all the basic familiar mechanics are implemented, grind for grinders, battle for battles, sandbox for sandstone, casual for casual, craft for crafters, etc., but made with a new look at making games. Everything here is comfortably balanced and everyone will find for themselves what they need.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2kuo.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Skilled Craftmans","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":141160,"name":"Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Collector's Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Assassin's Creed Valhalla, become Eivor, a legendary Viking raider on a quest for glory.

Horse Racing (US) or horseracing (UK) is an equestrian sport that has been practiced for millennia. It is inextricably associated with gambling. The common sobriquet for Thoroughbred horse racing is The Sport of Kings.\n\nHorse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: \"flat\" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2008 generated a world-wide market worth around US$115 billion.\n\nJapan conducts more than 21,000 horse races a year in one of three types: flat racing, jump racing (races over hurdles), and Ban'ei Racing (also called Draft Racing).\n\nThere are a total of thirty racetracks in Japan. Ten of these tracks are known as \"central tracks\", where most of Japan's top races are conducted. Races at these ten tracks are conducted by the Japan Racing Association (JRA), which operates under the oversight of the Japanese government. The remaining twenty tracks are operated by municipal racing authorities and run under the affiliation of the National Association of Racing (NAR). Two tracks, Sapporo Racecourse and Chukyo Racecourse, run separate meetings under either JRA or NAR jurisdiction.\n\nPower Stakes Grade 1 is the second game in Tose Software game series featuring the new data of the new season over the previous game.

The imperial state of Belaro, led by Lord Gradin, has resorted to heavily taxing its citizens, jailing those who cannot comply. Needless to say, this proves unpopular with the state's population, including Storch, a young farmer, and his friends and family. Soon, he's resorting to stealing from the rich to be able to help his family avoid prison. One excursion into a relatively wealthy part of Belaro ultimately leads him down a path that would change the course of Nevan's history.\n\nDesigned to be played as an ironman run, hence the large cast, Vision Quest boasts an incredible amount of content and a tone that slides carefully between drama and humor with its character interactions and small scale compared to most Fire Emblem games (more in line with Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 than anything else). The game is divided into four parts, similar to Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, with each progressively growing in scale without ever resorting to having you fight dragons or gods.
