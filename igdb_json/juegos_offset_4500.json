Things just keep getting more and more complicated: Why can't any of the Sisters give her a straight answer about what happened the night of the murder? Who--or what--is the mysterious figure that haunts the abbey? And just who was Sister Catherine?\n\nIn White Wool & Snow, Sister Hedwig must steel herself. Time is running out, and so is sympathy for her situation. It's understandable that being thrust into the waking world after a life of quiet reflection as an anchoress would require some adjustment, but if Hedwig wants to save an innocent man she will have to get serious fast.
