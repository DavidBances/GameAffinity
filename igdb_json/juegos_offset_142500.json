Akizuki High’s Superpower Club accomplishes their first victory and dominated the nationwide competition. However, the joy was only momentary. Due to a violent incident involving members of the Superpower Club right after the tournament, they were punished by getting their win revoked and banned from conducting club abilities for two years.\n\n…From then on, two years pass.\nUpon receiving the previously sealed-away key to the Superpower Club’s room, the club’s captain, Kanzaki Azuma, is given a heartless ultimatum by the school’s principal.\n\n“If the Superpower Club does not dominate all competition in the coming tournament, I’ll have it abolished.”\n\nThat was the secret agreement made in the past between Azuma and the principal.\n\nHowever, the only ones left in the Superpower Club were two members- Azuma himself and the Vice Captain Subaru Yamato. They had no time to worry about completely dominating the competition, as the real issue is the fact that they didn’t even have the minimum amount of required members. Even so, Azuma replied seemingly confident.\n\n“I’ll get it done.”\n\nAt the same time, a transfer student arrives. The second-year girl’s name was Sendou Futaba. Unexpectedly, Futaba’s mother is a member of the U.N.-supervised “R8″; a group whose members are composed of the strongest superpowered people. Azuma, seeing her as the last resort for the club’s continuation, headed towards her classroom…\n\n…Without knowing how much she really hates superpower clubs.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4t2q.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Otomate","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Idea Factory","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Design Factory","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":60717,"name":"Adventure Xpress","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A mobile puzzle game for IOS and Android.

Buy low, sell high - a merchant's motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems.\n\nA good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability.\n\nThe conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you'd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth.\nBut is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately?\n\nOr is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost's next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to say that you have nothing and hope they don't find anything?\n\nThese are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly.\n\nMerchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father's murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1r2l.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Forever Entertainment S.

Tolkien's Legendarium.\n\nThe game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.\n\nThe game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.\n\nThe melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.\n\nA unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20pd.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"WB Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Monolith Productions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Feral Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Behaviour Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":60538,"name":"Galaxy Trucker","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Build a spaceship out of a bunch of old junk and attempt to survive encounters with asteroids, slavers and smugglers as you haul cargo across the galaxy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2q7v.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":33663,"name":"Governor of Poker 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Governor of Poker 3 is the best free multiplayer poker game with a great design.

The fifth main entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa.\n\nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2zcv.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo SPD","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Koei Tecmo Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":303821,"name":"Shootinator","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Just shoot the living hell out of the incoming ships and watch some pinkish 80sness...\n\nNothing more...","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8a5p.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Siactro","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":293281,"name":"Clover Toshokan no Juunin-tachi","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"On the corner of a modern town, on higher ground atop a hill is a Western building, old as though it were left behind by time.
