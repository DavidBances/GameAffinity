Standing in your way are not only rival players but also the “MURFs” – security forces who will fight to the death to protect the precious cargo.\n\nOnce a team has stolen enough Merch, they activate the Plundership’s VIP Extraction, which is revealed on the map.

The crew that escapes first is the winner, so make sure it’s you!\n\nFast and frenetic combat is enhanced by the unique weaponry and ability of each Hyena. Additionally, each Plundership features zero gravity areas, some of which can be toggled on and off. Gunfights take on an entirely new dimension, literally, when gravity is no longer a concern.
