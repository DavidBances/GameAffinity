We are talking about thousands of recipe tweaks, a massive questbook with custom reward system, unique world generation, custom mods coded for the pack, custom Thauminomicon pages, and many more.\n\nThe main intentions of the pack are a long lasting experience and tying mods together in a progressive fashion, making it feel more like a single game than a compilation of mods thrown together.\nTo reach this goal GT New Horizons is using the tiers (basically ages of technology) from GregTech and allocates content of other mods to a fitting point within the progression.\nStarting in the stone age you will barely be able to survive until you get your first steam machines and eventually reach electricity. Later on you will have to visit other planets and dimensions to gather important ressources and fight mighty bosses to channel their magical power.\n\nIf you are fan of expert mode packs and want to take it to the next level this pack will be your friend!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4v5h.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":200546,"name":"Lust in Terror Manor","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Thirteen men and women trapped in a Western hotel on an island.
