It's pretty much a straight knock off of platformers like Sonic, but it does so with charm, personality, and bags of entertainment. The story revolves around the adventures of a little blue hedgehog (Sonic's sister perhaps?) and finds her travelling through an array of colorful environments, although it's not entirely clear why this should be necessary. In classic platform fashion, she runs around, leaps a bit and dashes at the many enemies which litter her path. In similar style to the Kirby games, you can absorb the power of defeated enemies which comes in handy during later stages, while you can also throw rocks at the bad guys a la Super Mario Bros 2. There are also Sonic-style springboards and the environments you travel through are your standard cutesy platformer-type levels. Adventures of Sting is certainly not shy about where it gets its inspiration from but while this criminal lack of originality has killed many other games in the past, here it seems to work to its advantage and actually results in a curiously enjoyable little title. The game gets off to a great start with its lush visuals which are just bursting with color and personality and with some lovely environments to discover. The controls are easy to pick up, while the platforming itself is largely entertaining and although not overly challenging, maybe this isn't such a big deal. All in all, something of a forgotten gem.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20m1.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":79505,"name":"Beatmania Append 3rdMix","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Beatmania Append 3rdMix is a rhythm game developed by Konami.

It is the first video game in the Carnivores series.\n\nThe player takes the role of a DinoHunt customer. At the start of a new game, the player must register a new hunter or continue with a saved hunter. The point of the game is hunting dinosaurs to get trophies and accumulate score. Each dinosaur represents a set number of points. A novice hunter starts with zero points, when his points increase he'll be able to hunt new dinosaurs on additional terrains with more powerful weapons. If the player is killed by a dinosaur, all points accumulated on that specific hunt are forfeited. The player must be picked up by DinoHunt to keep the points he earned.\n\nA hunter will become Advanced after earning 100 points, and Expert with 300. To begin a hunt, the player must choose the location, the weapon, the dinosaur and some hunting accessories which help the player but will deduct the score during that hunt. Each location is unique, with varying difficulties and terrain. The new hunter will be given three areas, with two more added for the Advanced hunter and a final area for the Expert hunter, for a total of six locations. Level locations include jungles, and deserts accompanied by pyramids and an ancient temple.\n\nNext, the player must choose a dinosaur to hunt. A new hunter will be given the choice of four dinosaurs: Parasaurolophus, Stegosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus and Allosaurus. An Advanced hunter gains the ability to hunt the Triceratops and the Velociraptor. Only an Expert hunter can hunt the Tyrannosaurus rex. Harmless creatures such as Moschops, Gallimimus and Dimorphodon are present in each level. They are worth zero points and can be killed with a single shot.\n\nThe player must also choose a weapon, which can be set for kill or tranquilize for additional points. A beginning hunter can only use a shotgun or a crossbow. A sniper rifle is unlocked upon becoming an Advanced hunter. First time hunters can use the Observation Mode to familiarize themselves with dinosaur behavior and different terrain.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2zh0.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":9230,"name":"Gangsters: Organized Crime","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gangsters is played by alternating between turn-based and real time gameplay.

You will also have to begin recruiting more hoods for your gang as soon as possible by giving your hoods the recruit order. Additional hoods can be recruited from gyms, pool halls, cafés, the docks and the unemployment office.\n\nThe hoods have many different attributes such as intelligence, fists, knives, etc. which make them suitable for different missions. A hood with high knife skill and low fists skill may inadvertently kill someone he was merely sent to beat up, for instance. Hoods can be promoted to lieutenant, which gives them the ability to lead teams of hoods. It is also possible to hire a lawyer and an accountant.

It is the third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by Bullfrog Productions in 1998. The PC version of the game was released November 30, 1998 and a PlayStation version was later developed and released on April 2, 1999.\n\nUnlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player in the role of a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.\n\nPopulous: The Beginning was the first entry in the series to use true 3D computer graphics; Bullfrog waited four years after Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods so that the graphics technology could catch up to their vision for a new and different game in the series. The developers considered the addition of terrain deformation and manipulation, combined with \"smart\" villagers who automatically attended to tasks, to add an entirely new dimension to the series. The game's original title was Populous: The Third Coming before being changed prior to the beta release.\nPopulous: The Beginning plays very differently from earlier titles and received mixed reviews. Reviewers positively noted the excellent graphics, while complaints were directed at the artificial intelligence and the indecision in game design between being a real time strategy title and a god game. GamePro's Peter Olafson wrote that Populous: The Beginning was not a bad game, in fact a good one; \"but it's a different game—one without a quintessential quality that defined Populous.\"","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25er.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":3696,"name":"The Settlers III","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The gods may be crazy!

The game follows the main character of the cartoon Rugrats, Tommy Pickles, who has lost eleven pieces of a twelve-piece jigsaw puzzle featuring the cartoon dinosaur Reptar. It is a 3D platform game which requires players to control several of the main characters in order to accomplish the goals through fourteen levels that are accessed when players pick up certain objects and also has bonus levels with Reptar bars. The levels can be played in any order, but the more difficult levels have to be unlocked to be playable.\n\nThe levels that players explore are mostly based on episodes from the cartoon, such as \"Chuckie's Glasses\", and contain various pieces of the Reptar puzzle. The game also has a training and activities mode, as well as a multiplayer mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8tid.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]}]
