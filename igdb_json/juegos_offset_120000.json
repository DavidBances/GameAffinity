For example, Devilish Calculations challenges you to recall the answer to a previous mathematical problem while paying attention to the next one in line. The questions come thick and fast and you have to concentrate hard while remembering specific information to make sure you don’t make any mistakes.\nAnother minigame, Devilish Mice challenges you to simultaneously track the path of several mice while they are being chased by cats. It sounds simple, but the exercise requires much concentration!\nIf you struggle with the exercise, the game will dynamically adjust the difficulty level based on your real-time results. By offering a stiff challenge and shifting the difficulty to match your performance, Devilish Brain Training will constantly push you to stay focused and access short-term memories.\n\nThe game will be available as a download on Nintendo eShop,","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co557t.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo of Europe","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo SPD","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":299450,"name":"Lab Escape!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome little specimen!\nYou're the unstable... thingy captured by scientist.\nConsume meats, select random Mutations, and Devour all bad guys in your sight!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8n17.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":285219,"name":"Age of the Ring","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"11 unique factions full of new heroes, spells, and abilities.
