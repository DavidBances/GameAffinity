The game plays like its predecessor, the player exploring the tower in a first-person view, fighting monsters and improving the hero's skills along the way. When the hero levels up, he gains points to be attributed to his different stats rather than having them distributed automatically. When the hero's level is significantly higher than that of the monsters on the level, random battles are suspended; only the battles triggered by stepping on specific spaces have to be fought. The game has two endings, one being a secret good ending.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7k9n.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Scap Trust","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":47517,"name":"Aleste Gaiden","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Aleste Gaiden is a vertical shoot 'em up video game developed by Compile in 1989.

The items you get come with different stats, that could improve your character's primary abilities, like strength or agility, add damage or raise the defenses and magical resistance. The rarer the item the more modifiers and higher they are, but also such items require certain character level to wield them.\n\nThe role playing system consists of a set of primary stats, usable skills and passive talents specific for each of the five character classes. Skills could be equipped and used on the game map: there are things like empowered attacks as rain of arrows, or something more original when for limited amount of time you could transform into an a giant spider that will let you bruteforce your way around.\n\nThe visual style is somewhat cartoonish in appearance as in another Blizzard game - Warcraft III.Besides the single player mode, it's possible to play together with up to four player characters on the same in-game locations. And at the same time on the arena you can challenge them to a fight.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jtlqbv57sobwez7pffh9.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cenega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"N-Gage"}]},{"id":47567,"name":"Puzzle Bobble VS","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bubble poppin' action on the N-Gage.

Spring Training is similar, but there the teams can be chosen. Full Season is the main game mode with a season 162 games. It follows the 2003 schedule and includes all inter-league games and the World Series. A season is started with an opening day MLB roster or a dream team. A dream team can be used in all games modes except for exhibition games. A dream team is built starting with a $45,000 budget for a 15-person roster including at least three pitchers and one player for each position. Players can still be bought or sold afterwards and money is earned based on the performance. During a season statistics change based on the performance. Games can be simulated to move quicker and tactics include setting the batting order and field lineup.\n\nThe three remaining game modes are World Series, Homerun Derby and 2 Player Game. World Series takes a team immediately to the World Series for the conclusion without having to play an entire season. Homerun Derby is a game of three rounds where two team take turns hitting the ball out of the park. After ten outs the teams switch positions. 2 Player Game is a local competitive multiplayer game using Bluetooth. There are three difficulty levels.\n\nAs in most baseball titles a game is split up into different phases, each with their own controls for hitting, running, pitching and fielding. However, outfield and base running are left almost entirely under the control of the computer. Hitting a ball is done by moving a target into a strike zone where the pitch will cross the plate while simultaneously timing the swing button. While pitching a small selection of pitches is offered, along with moving a target in the strike zone and timing a power meter to determine the speed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3z7i.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"THQ Wireless","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"N-Gage"}]},{"id":47569,"name":"Atari Masterpieces Vol. II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Atari Masterpieces Vol. II is a collection of twelve emulated Atari games.

Its gameplay was similar to SNK's earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat 'em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.\n\nThe game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen.[1] As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!,[2] the game's perspective may be considered either first-person or third-person.[citation needed] The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator. A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords 2 was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port.\n\nCrossed Swords requires correct timing and movement to progress. The basic rule for the game is to defend first before striking. The player wields both a weapon and shield and can strafe, as well as guard the upper or middle part of the body. Two different weapon strikes are available, a regular attack and a thrusting attack. Weapon-based magic can also be used. Multiple paths through the game are available and the player has an option to skip the first and second chapters freely.\n\nIn the enchanted land of Belkana all was well until plagues of creatures started rampaging through. But it didn't stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called \"The Knight of the Journey\" came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities. After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight's progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co65ap.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo CD"}]},{"id":47590,"name":"Mahjong Kyouretsuden","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An arcade riichi mahjong game by SNK (and one of the few in the genre built for the Neo Geo), telling the tale of a mahjong enthusiast trying to make a living off of it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qibjoqqzfqqhrkxubvop.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo AES"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo CD"}]},{"id":47591,"name":"Treasure of the Caribbean","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/e1kvgrxthsm55ntzeekx.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo AES"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo MVS"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo CD"}]},{"id":47592,"name":"The King of Fighters: Special Edition 2004","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Every year KOF improves its style, adds characters and creates a different story with a variety of fighting techniques.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5rz1.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":47593,"name":"King of Gladiator","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":47594,"name":"Minnasanno Okagesamadesu!

It's a maze, of sorts, and it's one hell of an irritating game. In fact, it is one of the most irritating games that most will ever come across. But it does have its charms, namely its offbeat gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are bright and colorful, with a lot of eye candy everywhere. Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing, as all that coloring and eye candy has been designed specifically to distract you from beating the level. All that glitter is isolated to the areas immediately surrounding the track, and if you look off the beaten path you'll notice that the graphics there are quite sparse and simplistic.\n\nThe sound and music are passable, though not particularly good. The Irritating Maze's songs sound like generic puzzle game music and are generally pretty forgettable, but they do fit the game's mood. You'll hear an announcer's voice at certain points of the game telling you that you've passed a checkpoint or something like that.\n\nThe announcer sounds reasonably excited, though if you listen you can hear a little bit of electronic fuzz distorting the voice clips. One sound clip stands out above the rest though, and that's the electric zap effect that plays when you lose. When this clip is combined with the associated graphics, the effect is literally shocking.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why the game is so irritating is that you have to control your character's conducting rod with a trackball. For most people, the trackball is not an ideal input device for precise control, especially when put under the stress of time limits. A digital joystick or D-pad would actually allow you to have more precise control, but then having to deal with unfamiliar controls is part of the \"fun.\"\n\nAt first you'll find the innovative gameplay to be a lot of fun, much like Marble Madness. But unlike Marble Madness, The Irritating Maze's gameplay gets old relatively quickly, and you'll find yourself not caring enough to give the level another go. The Irritating Maze is different enough to be entertaining for a couple of minutes but not quite polished enough to be a lot of fun for the long haul. Give it a quarter or two and see how you do.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/da2t8ib7un1x0xajjp83.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Saurus","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SNK","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo MVS"}]},{"id":47600,"name":"Master of Syougi","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shogi no Tatsujin is a Japanese style chess game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/n9emrhemkbda0bok9cs7.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SNK","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ADK Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo Pocket"}]},{"id":47601,"name":"Pocket Tennis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pocket Tennis a simple tennis game with two play modes: Exhibition and Tournament.\n\nExhibition is a single match against computer or human opponent (requires link cable).

One can even court, date and marry.\n\nIt's just one goal in a game filled with things to do and people to meet. The game is beautifully animated in a Japanese anime style. The open-ended gameplay styles mean the player can choose what they want to do whether it be breed animals, farm their fields, build relationships with the people around town or any combination of these activities as well as many others.\nThe DS allows for unique touch screen controls that are implemented into most of the in-game activities. With so many different activities and open-ended style simulation gameplay, there are hours and hours of entertainment available to players.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co49vj.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Success","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Graffiti Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":47798,"name":"Soul of Darkness","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Enter a fascinating gothic world as Kale, a mysterious, powerful man.

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\n\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.\n\nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings,[3] and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros.[4] Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys[5] and a series of Nintendogs trading cards.[6] At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xw2.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"iQue","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"iQue","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":47945,"name":"Transformers: War for Cybertron - Decepticons","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Transformers: War for Cybertron features two distinct storylines: the AUTOBOT campaign tells a story of heroism to save their home planet against overwhelming odds, and the DECEPTICON campaign tells a story of an unquenchable thirst for power to control the universe.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dfa.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":47946,"name":"Sokoban","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7bma.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":47948,"name":"Horse Life","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"GAME DETAILS \nYour Horse, Your Friend, Your Champion! \n \nIt’s the ultimate dream, a horse to call your own.
