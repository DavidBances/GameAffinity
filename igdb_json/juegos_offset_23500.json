The player takes control over one of these barbarian tribes, who as a whole stood out for a pronounced lack of cultural achievements, combined with a ferocious belligerence.

Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land.\n\nNavigation\nIn navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode.\n\nTorpedo\nIf you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.\n\nSea-to-land\nIf you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see \"Dock for refueling\" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city.\n\nSea-to-air\nIf a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite.

Ulrich is too old to undertake the task himself and so has sent his assistant, Kokotoni Wilf, on the mission instead. He has given Wilf magical wings to assist him on his quest.[2]\n\nThe game is a 2D flip-screen platformer. The player must guide Kokotoni Wilf through a series of six levels, all set in different historical eras, in search of the pieces of the amulet (which resemble Stars of David). When all the pieces in a level have been collected a timegate will open (a flashing amulet piece) to allow Wilf to travel to the next era. Wilf's journey begins amid dinosaurs in ancient prehistory and ends amid spaceships and robots in the year 2001.\n\nWilf cannot jump but can fly using his wings. He cannot kill enemies and must evade them instead.\n\nThe game was released in conjunction with a competition by Elite Systems.

The first level is on open air, with just mountains to dodge, missiles which try to hit the ship, and animated radars. From the second level onwards, the game is inside increasingly complex caverns, so the ceiling is also a danger, as well as new enemies - the missiles are now sometimes replaced with skulls that can move up and down, blocking the path.\n\nThe levels change with no pause, only the screen colour changes. After four levels there is a short fifth level where a base needs to be destroyed by dropping a bomb precisely, and then there is a firework animation as a reward. After all levels are finished, the ship goes back through inversed levels, with backward turned landscape.\n\nReviews at the time said that graphics and the game were impressive, even stunning.[1]\n\nThere is an edit mode for designing levels, and a training mode with infinite number of lives in which one can start from any level. Also, there is a simultaneous two-player mode. The game's sound consisted of a characteristic uplifting theme before ship launch, while in-game there were simultaneous shooting/explosion effects, which was relatively advanced use of the limited one channel Spectrum beeper system at the time.\n\nLater, versions for Commodore 64 and TRS-80 appeared.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7i2j.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Beam Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Melbourne House","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"TRS-80"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":25837,"name":"The Pedestrian","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Pedestrian is a 2.5D puzzle platformer that takes \"puzzle platforming\" literally.

And no one will tell you.\"\n\nIndiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom features six levels played across a \"Lost Kingdom.\" Playing as Indiana Jones, the player must solve a puzzle in each level to progress through the game. The player's ultimate goal is to retrieve a valuable artifact that contains the secrets of a lost civilization, before Jones' arch-rival, Ivar Reiss, can take it for himself. Indiana Jones is armed only with a mystical cane, and must battle against numerous enemies and perils throughout the game, including bats, monsters, steep cliffs, twisting mazes, and \"killer snowflakes\". Joystick movements vary between each level, requiring the player to relearn the control scheme throughout the game. A two-player option is also available.\n\nNo rules or gameplay information is provided to the player, who is left to use logic and intuition to solve each puzzle, as Indiana Jones would. Solving each puzzle requires the player to pay close attention to subtle changes in each level's surroundings or musical score, as well as other possibilities, testing the player's \"Indiana Jones Quotient\" (IJQ). However, the game's instruction manual does feature clues at the bottom of each page. Each clue is presented as a hieroglyphic, and must be deciphered by the player using a magic viewer, similar to 3D glasses. A \"clue hotline\" was also available for players, providing them with pre-recorded hints on how to finish each level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co97rh.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mindscape, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":25863,"name":"Paul Pixel - The Awakening","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An ordinary guy forced to defend the world from an alien invasion of infectious zombies.
