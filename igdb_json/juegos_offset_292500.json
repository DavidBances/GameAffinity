All it takes is a strategic mind and the will to command. Dive into our game now on Steam and lead your troops to glory!\n\nDive into 6 detailed campaigns each representing a pivotal phase of the Napoleonic Wars — from Preussisch-Eylau in 1807 to the battles of 1814. Each campaign offers a series of battles that shaped the course of history, bringing over 150 missions to your screen.\n\nEach mission showcases a historical battlefield with meticulously positioned army regiments, bringing military history battle maps directly to your screen. Historical accuracy meets tactical gameplay here, where the positioning and terrain play as much a role as your regiments and decisions.\n\nWe've meticulously recreated the authentic design of Napoleonic Wars-era army regiments, complete with historically accurate uniforms and capabilities. It's not just about classifying units as infantry, cavalry, or artillery; it’s about the unique history of each specific regiment, which can significantly impact their role on the battlefield.\n\nTo provide full immersion of battlefield command, we’ve combined turn-based elements like hexagonal grid movement with the simultaneous actions characteristic of RTS. This results in gameplay with a more deliberate pace, where quick reflexes aren’t essential—only a keen strategic mind.\n\nLeverage historical formations like squares, columns, or skirmish lines to gain tactical advantages on the battlefield. Transform your units dynamically to suit the unfolding tactical scenario. With a system designed to minimize randomness, predict the outcome of your strategies and attacks with high accuracy, similar to traditional tabletop wargaming.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8v52.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Revvy Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":318050,"name":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 2 - Torikago","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 2 - Torikago is the second chapter of a horror movie sold exclusively through the Dreamcast Direct online service.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8v5c.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ASCII Entertainment & Communications","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":318051,"name":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 3 - Kansei","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 3 - Kansei is the third chapter of a horror movie sold exclusively through the Dreamcast Direct online service.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8v5d.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ASCII Entertainment & Communications","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":318052,"name":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 4 - Kaikou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 4 - Kaikou is the fourth chapter of a horror movie sold exclusively through the Dreamcast Direct online service.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8v5e.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ASCII Entertainment & Communications","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":318053,"name":"Block Puzzle","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An addictive Block Puzzle game, become a block puzzle master.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"FALCON GAMES","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":318054,"name":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 5 - Shokuzai","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Grauen no Torikago: Kapitel 5 - Shokuzai is the fifth chapter of a horror movie sold exclusively through the Dreamcast Direct online service.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8v5g.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ASCII Entertainment & Communications","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":318055,"name":"AetherShot","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Aethershot is a 2D top-down rogue-lite with a spell crafting system to allow for great customization when delving into the trial grounds at the Temple of Masrong.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8vps.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":318056,"name":"Samabake!
