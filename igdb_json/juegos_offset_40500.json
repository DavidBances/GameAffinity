Shortly thereafter, the tribe laid witness to the deformed birth of their prophesied leader, born without a face, and fled Antarctica in fear of what the meteorite was capable of. In the present day, the ancient Polynesian city has been buried beneath snow and ice and RX Tech are excavating the site, investigating the meteorite. Led by Dr. Willard, the crew discovers remnants of the Polynesian city, ancient stone statues resembling the Easter Island Moai, and finds the grave of a man named Paul Caulfield of the HMS Beagle.\n\nWhen the game begins, Lara Croft is in India searching for a legendary stone in the ruins of an ancient temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. She encounters Tony, an RX Tech employee who seems to be suffering from a severe bout of jungle fever.

It is based around the fame of American football champion Kurt Warner. It is a modified version of NFL Blitz set in the Arena Football League. Arena ball is a version of American football played indoors on a 50 yard field with nets behind each endzone and boards on the sidelines.\n\nKurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed differs from other American football video games due to its usage of the arena football system. A few rule changes include that there are half as many players on the field, field goals go back into play if they miss the goalposts, and there's no such thing as punting. The game is compared to NFL Blitz 2000 for its violence, and one reviewer even noted that \"The post-play violence has been pumped up to the level that Blitz had before the NFL forced Midway to tone it down.\"\n\nA Dreamcast version was announced at the same time as \"Arena Football\" prior to rebranding to \"Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed\", however the Dreamcast version was cancelled for unknown reasons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xma.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Midway","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":43722,"name":"K-1 Grand Prix","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The rough and tumble world of professional kickboxing comes to the PlayStation with K-1 Grand Prix.

The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work.\n\nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage.\n\nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level.\n\nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish.\n\nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing.\n\nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel).\n\nA mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live.\n\nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair.\n\nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2's track almost sounds as if it's been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It's eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo's King's Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King's Field I Arrange Collection.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co60qu.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Techno Soleil","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":43759,"name":"Time Bokan Series: Bokan Desuyo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A scrolling shooter based on Tatsunoko's Time Bokan anime franchise.

Several tactics give the manager a lot of depth to change into the style more suitable for the footballers available .

Players are tasked with driving a train, adhering to the schedule and obeying signals and speed restrictions. It features real-world train lines from Japan, including the Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line. The game was ported to the PC, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation.\n\nThe concept for Densha de Go! was inspired by designer Akira Saito's personal fascination with Japanese train lines and railroads. He wanted to create a game that allowed players to familiarize themselves with driving a train. The controls were his primary focus as he wanted them to be accurate and responsive, and to mimic the controls of a real train—his father worked for the Kyoto City Transportation Bureau Facilities Division, which made this easier to accomplish. Saito included real-world railroads and trains to appeal towards other railroad enthusiasts, thinking that it could also attract more \"ordinary\" players for its realistic, familiar theme. As arcades at the time were dominated primarily by racing and fighting games, he believed its unique concept could make it stand out.\n\nDensha de Go! is among Taito's most successful games, preceded only by Space Invaders. The PlayStation version sold over one million copies. The game was well-received by critics for its controls, attention to detail, and unique concept. Some felt that its home releases lacked enough content and had poor visuals. It was followed by a long series of sequels, spin-offs, and reimaginings, beginning with Densha de Go! 2 in 1999.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25b3.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito GM R&D Sect. #2","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"UNBALANCE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":43851,"name":"Gaball Screen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Promotional music-visual experience released exclusively in japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2tit.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Antinos Records","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"System Sacom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":43852,"name":"Suzuki Bakuhatsu","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A bomb-disposal puzzle game released exclusively in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7k0r.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sol","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Enix","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":43853,"name":"Grand Theft Auto: Collector's Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Collector’s Edition of Grand Theft Auto comes in a 3-disc sleeve and includes full copies of Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto London, and Grand Theft Auto 2, each with a map of the game world.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ha2.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DMA Design","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Rockstar Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":43854,"name":"Initial D","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Popular manga Initial D, appeared in the PS.

Hot on the heels of the first war comes this new battle, one that will take our faithful green soldiers into battle on land, sea, air, and even deep underground to rat out the Tan forces. The ultimate mission: seek and destroy the secret Tan weapons factory and perhaps put an end to this struggle for once and for all.\n\nArmy Men: World War - Final Front is another chapter in the popular Army Men series from 3DO, and the sequel to Army Men: World War - Land Sea and Air.

Players will guide the soldier via a third-person, behind-the-back perspective, marching him boldly forward to take on the enemy onslaught.\n\nThe single-player game takes players through five different campaign, each set in a different global location and each with their own specific objectives. The soldier has a host of weapons to fight off the enemy soldiers and vehicles, armaments ranging from rifles and bazookas to flame throwers. He'll also be able to procure vehicles himself. Players will pilot tanks, jeeps, cargo trucks, motorcycles, and submarines in their quest to destroy the enemy supply and weapon lines.\n\nIn Multiplayer mode, two players are able to compete in head-to-head action or team up against the computer. Capture the Flag is included, is Grudge Match, which simply lets them blow each other up until only one is left standing.

Diplomata takes place in the end of the 21st century, after the collapse of the human civilization we know.\nThe boundaries of the once-existed states have stayed the same, but some countries became more powerful than others. A player has to strive to build a country that’s wealthier than others, knowing that other players will try to achieve the same goal. So, it’s up to a player to use everything from diplomacy to war to develop the most powerful country. This is a turn-based game and a player gets 3 turns in every minutes (300 turns is maximum, though). Turns are made for developing of the country (improving industry, agriculture or building objects) and for interaction with allies and enemies (sending help, attacking, secret service actions etc.).\nEvery player has enough time to analyze, think and plan before they make a turn. Plus, having equal number of turns enables equal game. Diplomata is also played in rounds with every round lasting one month and first day in the next month every player starts from zero, which gives all players opportunity to plan new round from the very beginning and, of course, to take revenge on enemies. If you like games that require both social and strategy skills and allow players to team up with other players or compete against them, Diplomata might be an ideal strategy game for you. With hundreds (and counting) players from all around the globe, this game promises a rewarding gaming experience. It’s perfect for those players who don’t fancy downloading or installing anything in order to play games, since it’s fully browser based.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jjlmuzywloxcjwxslpgz.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ofanziva","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":44109,"name":"Baki the Grappler: Ultimate Championship","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Grappler Baki: Ultimate Championship is a mobile fighting game based on Baki the Grappler anime and manga series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3gv0.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":44110,"name":"The Last Sin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Last Sin is an open world massive JRPG that features over 150 recruitable characters that have their own stories that go untold if they die in battle.

It’s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris.\n- Bigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this.\n- Brand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don’t sit too close though. (If your parents aren’t home you can sit as close as you want we won’t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.)\n- A soundtrack composed by Ridiculon so intense that the state of Wyoming has issued a ban on all audio devices capable of playing it out of fear that just a single note will cause the dormant super volcano beneath Yellowstone to erupt ushering in a new age of darkness.\n- Frame by frame artisan crafted in game animations, and animated cutscenes that will make you experience procedurally generated emotions.\n- A story so rich and moving that it makes Citizen Kane look like an unboxing video for a dehumidifier.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5qlr.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Thunderful","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team Meat","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":44130,"name":"Tactics: Bludgeons Blessing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tactics: Bludgeons Blessing.\nThis is a real-time strategy, combined with a shooter of an airplane, a tank, a rocket launcher, a ship and a submarine. \nModern warfare.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27rt.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":44131,"name":"Lunaform","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Lunaform is a puzzle arcade game like breakout, but instead of destroying all of the blocks you fill them up.
