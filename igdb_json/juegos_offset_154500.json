Players must deal with the fallout from the devastating attacks on U.S. and British soil in a storyline that picks up where 2009's Modern Warfare 2 left off. The single-player campaign has you battling Russian ultranationalists, led by Vladimir Markov, as members of the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS. You'll battle across war-torn areas of New York City, London, Paris, Mogadishu, Dubai, and other regions as you prepare to end the global threat once and for all.\n\nAs with previous entries in the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 3's campaign features a heavily scripted, cinematic experience with Hollywood-style special effects. One new mission, for example, has you involved in underwater travel with a sonar-equipped submersible watercraft. You'll then fight inside an enemy-controlled submarine before guiding an inflatable raft across turbulent waters while a naval battle rages nearby. Other sequences have you firing mounted guns, driving vehicles, and more while explosions light up the landscape.\n\nReturning to the game is the cooperative Spec Ops mode that features a series of standalone missions on different maps. New to Spec Ops is a survival option that has you and either a friend or a computer partner battling waves of enemy forces. Shooting down enemies earns you cash, which can be used to purchase new perks, items, weapons, and other upgrades. You'll also be able to earn bonuses by working together as a team and maintaining kill streaks.\n\nThe heart of the game is once again the 18-player online component, which introduces all-new maps and a variety of enhancements to the format introduced in Modern Warfare 2. Popular features such as kill-streak awards, experience points, weapons-based achievements, and perks return, allowing you to customize your character as you progress. An optional subscription service entitled \"Call of Duty Elite\" will allow players to track detailed statistics such as win-loss records, kill-death ratios, time played, most successful maps, favorite weapons, and much more.\n\nHardened Edition bonus items include a Steelbook case, collectible field journal, special ops juggernaut outfit for your Xbox Live avatar, premium membership to Call of Duty Elite, and special founder status on Call of Duty Elite. Call of Duty Elite's premium membership includes all future downloadable content (DLC) for Modern Warfare 3, of which there are 20 pieces of DLC expected within the first nine months following the game's release.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4a7p.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Infinity Ward","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sledgehammer Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":45279,"name":"Heavy Rain: Director's Cut","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Heavy Rain: Director's Cut was released as a \"complete\" version of the game which includes the only piece of downloadable content, The Taxidermist, as well as the game soundtrack, Playstation Move support, eight making-of videos, three dynamic themes, fifteen pieces of concept art, and two bonus trailers.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dmw.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":20223,"name":"Big League Sports","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kinect sporting game for Xbox 360 from Robomondo and Activision.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/a4nvllpttjhauigiojng.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":20213,"name":"The Price is Right: Decades","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A budget-priced videogame version of The Price is Right, with the subtitle \"Decades\" being their excuse for the fact that the virtual prizes being offered are years out of date.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ph8q0ib1j3niz1coo3b6.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ludia, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":316939,"name":"Vampire Skills","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Play with the vampire and use his skills in this online puzzle game.

Six years later, anomalies are detected in the space-time fabric, yet tests reveal nothing out of order, with the portals regularly functioning for both teleportation and time travel; also, the leader of the DonPachi squadron Colonel Godwin Longhener dismisses the matter due to the lack of actual danger.\n\nNevertheless, a technician delves deeper into the anomaly, discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. In an ironic twist, the virus is discovered to be the program originally installed in the Element Dolls six years ago, now reaching beyond the DonPachi Corps programming and seeking to annihilate the human race in retaliation for their \"enslavement\" (after the war, they met a rather cruel demise at the hand of their own human creators) by waging war in the past rather than in the present: unsettled, the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to fight back the invasion before future changes.
