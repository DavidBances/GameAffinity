[…] We had spent 15 months developing the title, and although many of us felt we achieved so much, it wasn’t enough to save the title.” \n \nThe developer's website described Hellgate as follows: \"Imagine a crossover between Quake and WipeOut.

There will be four gigantic realms to conquer, as well as ten formidable weapons to defeat the many demons and monsters lurking within Hell.\" \n \n\"We will also be supporting Dreamcast’s online capabilities with online Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Sumo and Time Trial modes, and also feature offline 4 player Deathmatch and link-up Deathmatch modes.
