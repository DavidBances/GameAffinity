Ryojou-hen), Densha de Go!! features a deluxe multi-monitor cockpit housing (with four screens, three large ones to form a panoramic view and one touchscreen to display ) resembling E231-500 series trains, and modern high-definition graphics built on Unreal Engine 4.\n\nWhile the game only included parts of the Yamanote Line and the Chuo-Sobu Line from the start, it received additional routes (with new vehicles) in regular bi-yearly updates (including parts of the Osaka Loop Line, the Hanshin Main Line, the Chuo West Line, and the Meitetsu Nagoya Main Line, as well as an extension of the Yamanote Line).\n\nIn 2019, the game received an alternate \"compact\" cabinet resembling those used in the original arcade game. It also received two bonus \"Fukkoku-ban\" game modes, providing a faithful recreation of two of the original arcade games: one for Densha de Go! (on June 26, 2019) and one for Densha de Go! 2: Kousoku-hen 3000-bandai (on September 25, 2019). The game also received a child-friendly spin-off known as Densha de Go!! Kids, which uses a more simplistic cabinet.\n\nIt later received a revamped console version for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in 2020-2021 as Densha de Go!! Hashirou Yamanote-sen. This version is notable for having the full Yamanote Line, as well as routes parallel with it.\n\nOn March 10th, 2021, the Keihein Tohoku Line was added.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2z3c.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":134414,"name":"Comfort","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Created in 2 days for the Self Care Jam 2.\n\nIt's more like a relaxing screensaver than a game.\n\nIt's a lil' scruffy currently as I'd put aside 3 days to make this but something cropped up and it dropped to 2.
