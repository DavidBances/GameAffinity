The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States.\n\nThe game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wa0.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Harmonix Music Systems","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"RedOctane","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":315962,"name":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 3rd Edition - Family Picture Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 3rd Edition - Family Picture Edition is a British DVD game released by Universal Pictures UK which is based on the British version of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8s8w.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Universal Pictures","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ZOO Digital Group","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DVD Player"}]},{"id":137695,"name":"The Game of Life / Yahtzee / Payday","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Three board games are playable in this compilation, which, like the title suggests, are \"The Game of Life,\" \"Pay Day,\" and \"Yahtzee.\" Based off this selection, the compilation is seemingly themed especially to economics and chance. Each time a game is selected, the player has the option to select the number of players, along with whether each player is to be controlled by person or computer.\n\n\"The Game of Life,\" which allows two to four players, involves progressing through many events from the start of college or work, to retirement. The wheel, which can land on numbers 1-10, is meant to determine how many spaces (or sometimes how much money) the player proceeds (or gains). Each space can either mean earning or losing money, and/or it can affect the process of the players/opponent(s) through the game. A few spaces, however, must be landed on by every player. The goal is to retire with the most money.\n\n\"Pay Day\" is similar to \"The Game of Life\" in that the player must have the most money to win, and two to four players can participate. However, the length of the game can be determined, as the game (which is shaped like a calendar) can range from one to six months. The player may land on spaces that, once again, affect the amount of money possessed by oneself or others. There are \"Lottery,\" \"Event,\" and \"Auction\" spaces to name a few. At the end of each month is the \"Pay Day\" space.\n\n\"Yahtzee\" has the player roll dice to obtain certain combinations for points. Like the other two games, two through four players can participate; however, this game can also be a single-player experience. Each player gets to roll up to three times to try to fulfill their dice combination; one could try to roll ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, or Yahtzee. If the player feels dissatisfied about the results, he/she can place the score for that turn into the \"Chance\" section; however, the score of each turn must go into one open space corresponding to one of the mentioned combinations. The most points earned wins.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4z6x.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DSI Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Black Lantern Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":91423,"name":"Candy Land / Chutes & Ladders / Original Memory Game","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripci√≥n","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":77240,"name":"Mouse Trap / Operation / Simon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Triple pack Gameboy Advance, Mouse Trap / Operation / Simon","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zpu4o7wnlicwz1apn6fm.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Destination Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gravity-i","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":71719,"name":"Lost in the Nightmare","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Private detective Burak G√ºney travels to Karabalta Town to investigate the disappearance of three university students who were camping in the woods.

The game was released very late in the life of the Dreamcast, but sold much better than expected, probably because there were no other home ports planned in the foreseeable future.\n\nPlayers assume control of a helicopter, which can be rotated like a more limited version of the mechanism in Zero Gunner 2. Gameplay is largely very traditional, and bears a strong resemblance to some older Toaplan games, especially Twin Cobra. It uses 3D graphics, and a slightly angled perspective to give the game more depth than most other titles in the genre.\n\nOn October 27, 2011, G.rev announced a remake titled Under Defeat HD to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[1] The game is released by Rising Star Games on February 23, 2012 in Japan, November 9, 2012 in the UK and set to be released on November 28, 2012 in North America for PlayStation 3 only and January 25, 2013 in Europe.

After fighting through the countryside, he manages to get to the small town but learns that it is overrun as well. However, he is captured by the evil sheriff and is nearly killed when a non-zombified police officer rescues him. The player then fights through the town and ends up at Dr. Franklin's Asylum, the nexus of the zombie outbreak. After meeting Dr. Franklin and his army of new zombies, called Zorks, the player nearly sacrifices himself to destroys the asylum and Dr. Franklin, who is still in the building when it is destroyed. However, he wakes up in a hospital later and learns that the zombies are still spreading.\n\nHe goes back to the Asylum and finishes off Dr. Franklin. Another non-zombified police officer offers to fly the player out of the city after Franklin is killed. However, while the player is flying away, the sheriff appears in a helicopter and attempts to kill them. The player kills the sheriff and manages to escape the doomed town.\n\nOne twist in the game is that the player is stripped of all their weapons at the start of each chapter, forcing the player to start from scratch. Otherwise, it plays very similar to Half-Life.\n\nThey Hunger borrows some of its art from other GoldSrc games, such as Team Fortress Classic and Counter-Strike.

These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.\nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\".\nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events.\nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them.\nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins).\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player.\nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2nhp.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Criterion Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":314459,"name":"Half-Life 2: Game of the Year Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The critics agree, Half-Life 2 has been named PC GAME OF THE YEAR by over 35 organizations worldwide.

This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller.
