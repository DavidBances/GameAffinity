Once, she went to a restaurant with her parents and said 'Thanks, you too!' to a waiter who told her to enjoy her meal. ...She hasn't had the courage to show her face there since. But fortune is a fickle mistress, and much to the chagrin of her and her classmates, she's found herself in the window seat at the back of the classroom normally set aside for the main character. And when one misunderstanding leads to another, she briefly considers writing an autobiography and titling it 'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' copyright be damned.\n\nKohinata Koharu is the former student council president and resident popular girl, considered mysterious by some and out of reach to all. It was by sheer happenstance she passed by Komori's classroom when she did, inadvertently saving her from the wonton wrath of her peers. But an accident is just fate by another name, and on a whim, she takes a blossoming interest in the other... with no ulterior motives whatsoever. Setting aside the fact that Komori doesn't believe in genuine altruism, she can't figure out why someone at the top of the pecking order would rub shoulders with a lowly ant like her... But for the longest time, she has wanted to change... if only she could. Now that she can, the opportunity is paired with the harrowing realization that rest of her youth depends on Koharu's opinion of her. When she said \"this couldn't possibly get any worse!!\", that wasn't a challenge, you know!!! So it's easier said than done... but that doesn't mean she doesn't want to try! After all, this is the kind of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that someone like her could only dream of!!\n\nWill Komori be able to grow out of her shell, or will her life turn into a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare himself? Can she really get through all the items on her 'how to properly enjoy my youth! ♡' checklist when it's been untouched for over a year?? A thriving social life might be a bit of a stretch, but surely, she can manage to make a few friends, right?\n\n...Right??","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co70o8.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":264351,"name":"Useless Demon Lord","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Lucille is an unemployed single woman living alone in her apartment, stewing in feelings of anxiety and inadequacy... but then without warning and due to a rather strange magical mix-up, she is summoned to be the new Demon Lord in another world!\n\nThe demons aren't doing so well lately, and they're now relying on their new boss to return them to their glory days.

It has (almost) everything we’ve ever wanted to experience in a game like this – a non-linear campaign, deep tactical gameplay, resource management, destructible environment and a sh*tload of different weapons. The only thing we are sparing for the future (when we have moar moneys) will be role-playing and a dynamic open ended campaign.\n\nTurn-based strategy is a thinking man’s game. You analyze your enemy for weak spots, think your moves ahead and execute them. No matter what is happening, you’ll have the time to think about your next move. Maybe it’s because we are too old to master Counter Strike, or because we suck at quick time events, but nevertheless, we think that this is the way it should be.\n\nEnd State has been under development as a hobbyist project already for a decade and has seen multiple revisions, each being more advanced and more fun than the previous one. While we are targeting a more hardcore audience, the game should still be accessible enough for anyone to learn. We sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy playing it as much as we do.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nTake command of a ragtag mercenary team with multiple characters with custom skill sets and weapons, facing a variety of enemies with different capabilities and weaknesses. Plan your moves in variable terrain that forces you to consider about character positioning. Directional facing matters and characters can peek around the corners. This is important because the “fog of war” only shows what the units actually see.\n\nUse cover for your benefit and aim your shots at specific body parts for different results. Face varying missions with different objectives ranging from planting a tracking device to releasing hostages and the enemy AI will, of course, act according to their separate motives.\n\nManage your team through a non-linear campaign. Recruit mercs, equip them and upgrade their skills as they gain more experience. The campaign is not linear, and in one playthrough you’ll never see everything the game has to offer. We aim to develop a future classic you can enjoy for years to come.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pr2.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Iron Sight","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":319340,"name":"Two Little Ghosts of that House: The Missing Toy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8x4e.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":311306,"name":"Do You Really Want To Know?","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Open your social media app and start your daily life.\n\nThis is an interactive fiction jointly launched by Gamtropy and Taiwan AIDS Society (LOVE my VOICE)\n\nDo You Really Want to Know? is a role-playing game that simulates a social media app. Overprotective parents, dysfunctional workplaces, and friends with hidden agendas - all the pressures and events could be opportunities to reexamine each other's relationships.
