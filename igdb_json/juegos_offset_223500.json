It was the beginning of the 'Great Crusade' in Northern Europe by the Western Allies, yet was viewed as long overdue by the bloodied Soviets. Few realize that the casualties suffered in the three months of the summer of 1944 in Normandy rivaled the worst of the Eastern Front. The air and seaborne landings in Northern France were the largest the world has ever seen, with meticulous planning for D-Day, yet marked by a surfeit of clear goals once ashore. Both the bocage terrain and the dogged defense by the Germans resulted in the need for unexpected improvisation. Both sides had significant constraints; the British were nearing manpower exhaustion and would have to rely excessively on their armor arm, the United States had boundless resources but many of their divisions had never been in combat, while the Germans were short of everything and it was only through their ability to organize disparate troops into flexible kampfgruppen that they held the Allies for as long as they did. Ultimately, the Battle of Normandy resulted in the utter defeat of the Germans at Falaise with France and Belgium quickly liberated thereafter. The Allied advance would last till late September 1944, ending in the streets of Arnhem with Operation Market Garden. This second release in the Panzer Battles franchise is focused on many of the battles that occurred across the Calvados & Cotentin regions of Northern France. Fought across nearly three months from June 6th 1944 to August 20th 1944, actions from the D-Day landings, through the bocage fighting to the pursuit and destruction of the German forces at Falaise are included.\n\nBattles of Normandy includes 93 Scenarios – covering all sizes and situations, including specialized versions for both head to head play and vs. the computer AI.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6944.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Wargame Design Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":241429,"name":"GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class: Slapstick Wonderland","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Inside an airplane heading for Japan, Mari is clutching a sketchbook which once belonged to her grandma, who is now deceased.

Developer Łukasz Kur and musician Robi put together the game in aid of the 2016 Cowlitz Gamers for Kids Expo, an event organised by popular retro gaming YouTuber John Hancock plus friends Chelsea Beck and Jonathan Rose.\n\nThe Cowlitz Gamers’ Adventure casts you in the role of youngster Justice as he delves into some mysterious caves in search of gold. Following the format of classic 8-bit single-screen platformers, your goal is seemingly simple: collect all the gold before the time runs out.\n\nNaturally, accomplishing this goal is anything but simple, as there are scores of obstacles and dangerous creatures just waiting to make Justice’s life miserable. With no way to fight back, Justice will have to avoid these various perils on his quest if he wants to survive long enough to spend all his shinies!\n\nIn classic 8-bit platformer style, all of the obstacles in your path run on strict, set patterns. When you start a new level, take a moment to watch how everything moves in relation to one another, and you’ll soon be able to spot an opportunity to get through safely. Even the most seemingly impenetrable obstacles have a safe path through — but thinking of a plan is just half the battle.
