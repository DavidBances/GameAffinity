It is similar to the PC and console versions of the same name and by the same developer. Those versions are not identical and described as an \"upmake\" of the NES version. The game borrows elements from Windjammers, which served as an inspiration.\n\nPlayers select one of six characters from a cast with names such as Rad Carlton, Bruiser Bogardus, Hot Foot Francis, Sparerib Boneapart, Mayo Monsoon or Ollie Oilsack. There are also multiple environments and different game modes. The characters are described as lumberjacks. Matches take place on a fixed screen view shown from an elevated position. Characters are standing on rolling logs and throw an axe that acts like a ball.\n\nIn a typical tournament different opponents need to be defeated one after the other. Points are scored by throwing the axe into the goal area behind the opponent. This zone is different for each environment. Sometimes there is only a single, large goal area, while another environment has three zones for five, two and five points respectively. In some levels like North Pool the middle part is entirely open, while in others like Mount Olympus the axe can only be thrown through a few open passages.\n\nThe opponent guards these areas and attempts to catch or bounce back the axe to try the same on the other side. A set is won when someone reaches twelve points. The best of three sets wins a match. Special items appear during matches such as stars (use a signature throw different for each character), magnets (increase catching range for five seconds), ice cubes (decrease the opponent's movement speed for a short amount of time) and oil (the axe cannot be caught for five seconds and will bounce back instead, and at a reduced speed). There are counters for some power-ups. For instance, when the signature throw is caught by the opponent, their signature throw becomes active right away.\n\nThe game supports competitive multiplayer against another opponent on the same screen. The game comes in a box with a green cartridge and a full colour manual.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3j6y.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Plug In Digital","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mega Cat Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":55011,"name":"Pokémon Chasm Crosser","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A browser game featuring Pikachu, Rockruff and Togedemaru.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7k6l.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"The Pokémon Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":54619,"name":"Snake vs. Block","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Swipe your finger to guide a snake of balls and break the bricks. \nTry to break as many bricks as possible. \nGet additional balls and make the biggest snake ever! \n \nVery easy to play but very hard to reach high scores! \n \nGame Features: \n- Free to play \n- Endless gameplay \n- Simple swipe control \n- Challenge your friends with the best highscore","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2v2q.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Voodoo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":53821,"name":"Tom Clancys Splinter Cell Collection","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This collection includes five of the games in the Splinter Cell series:\n\n- Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\n- Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory\n- Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent\n- Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction (Deluxe Edition)\n- Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist (Deluxe Edition)","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8i25.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":53717,"name":"Tekken 7: Deluxe Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This edition includes the full TEKKEN 7 game and all additional content eligible to the Season Pass.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co232d.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":53069,"name":"Gremlins, Inc.: The Governor Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This version includes:\n\n- Gremlins, Inc.\n- Gremlins, Inc. – Uninvited Guests DLC\n- Gremlins, Inc. – Automated Competitors DLC\n- Gremlins, Inc. – Astral Gamblers DLC\n- Gremlins, Inc. – Famous Figures DLC\n- Gremlins, Inc. – Original Soundtrack","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co85ea.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Yukitama Creative Industries","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Alexey Bokulev","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sergei Klimov","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Charlie Oscar Lima Tango Interactive Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":53036,"name":"For Honor: Deluxe Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This version contains:\n\n- For Honor\n- Digital Deluxe Bundle","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30z8.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Montreal","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":52616,"name":"Baldur's Gate: The Complete Saga","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Set in the Forgotten Realms Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting, Baldurs Gate: The Complete Saga is an adventure like no other.

In Project Visitor you build the world around you, you attack others and the lands they have built and the whole world is saved to the database. Also the world continues to grow and battles happen, lands are lost, gained, etc even while your offline. To maintain your land you have to be involved, join a protective group called a MDN, own, mine, defend, survive! \n \nPreviously known as 10Six, it was Sega's first foray into MMO's, a persistent online RTS where players signed up for one of four mega-corporations aiming to conquer the rogue planet Visitor, which has entered the solar system and contains a treasure of valuable resources. \n \nPlayers construct and capture mining sites, construct defenses and NPC units to help defend and attack in a fairly traditional RTS mode, but much of the game also consists of player on player combat in first or third person modes, similar to Battlezone or Planetside. \n \nThe server infrastructure was designed to be able to handle a million simultaneous players and was hosted through SegaSoft's Heat.net, but never saw player counts that high. After failing to attract a sufficiently large audience Sega shut down the game in June 2002, offering refunds to anybody with subscription time left. \n \nA community effort to relaunch the game was started soon after the servers were taken down.
