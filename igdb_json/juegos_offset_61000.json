It has virtually no story and relies entirely on exploration and strategic combat. Set in a medieval world with little to no distinguishing characteristics, \"Lunatic Dawn\" throws the player immediately into the game world, which is open for him to explore. The player is able to choose the main character's gender, race (human, elf, etc.), class, and even age - older characters are more powerful, but have a more limited play time.\n\nIndeed, the entire gameplay process is timed. Traveling to a remote city or dungeon can take up to several game days. The player has to provide sufficient food for his party during this time. Player party consists of pre-generated characters, who have different names and belong to different races and classes, but have virtually no personality. Food and other supplies can be acquired in towns, through which the player moves in a Wizardry-like fashion - viewing locations from first-person perspective and selecting menu commands.\n\nWhen the party enters a dungeon, the view switches to isometric. The dungeons are large and maze-like, with enemies visible on screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a battle initiates. The battles are turn-based but fast-paced, reminding somewhat the Infinity Engine battles from Baldur's Gate series. The participants can freely move on the battle field. The player directly controls only the main characters, but can assign general commands to the party members.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lk16msjxzvj0vgwxwmor.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-FX"}]},{"id":66182,"name":"Lunatic Dawn II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second title in the role-playing series from Artdink, released in 1994 for FM-Towns and PC98.\n\nLike other Lunatic Dawn games, Lunatic Dawn II is, despite its Japanese origins, an exploration-oriented Western-style RPG.

The player starts in a city and is absolutely free to go wherever he/she wants. There is a day/night cycle in the game. It is necessary to keep an eye on the character's stamina and buy food rations - the character can die of exhaustion and hunger. Random enemies appear on the world map and in dungeons. Battle screen is isometric and allows free movement. It is not necessary to choose a command for each turn: the battles evolve automatically until the player interrupts them with a new command.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4o3b.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Artdink","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":66184,"name":"Carnage Heart EZ: Easy Zapping","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A mecha action-strategy game from Artdink.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hqiwy67lzwriptrqsgdh.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":66185,"name":"How Many Robots?","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An action game from Artdink.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co47ih.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Artdink","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX2"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":66186,"name":"Zeus: Carnage Heart Second","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sequel to Carnage Heart, a mecha action-strategy game from Artdink.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4muc.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Artdink","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":66187,"name":"Zeus II: Carnage Heart","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A mecha action strategy game from Artdink.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4qxg.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Artdink","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":66189,"name":"Carnage Heart Portable","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Carnage Heart Portable is an Action game, developed by Artdink and published by Genki, which was released in Japan in 2006.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ava.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Artdink","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Genki","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":66190,"name":"Super Laser: The Alien Fighter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Laser recreates the true spirit of the classic shoot'em up games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6o5m.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":66191,"name":"ChocChocPop","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"ChocChocPop was the first self-published title for EpicForce.

During the missions the scope is limited because all missions have a time limit. Only the final bonus mission, where the player is awarded luxury cars, can be played without any restrictions. The player can move around on foot or in cars that can be stolen. The game is controlled from a third-person perspective with an optional inside view while driving a car. Movement is done through the keyboard while the mouse is used to steer, zoom and rotate the camera.\n\nBy performing missions or beating up people the player earns cash. This can be used to repair a car or get gas as all cars only have a limited supply. This is shown in the bottom right corner of the screen while the bottom left corner shows a mini-map of the city to view gas stations, targets or police cars when a tracker has been installed. In the different missions the player will need to steal cars, install trackers on police cars, race another character, kill an entire opposing gang or escort the boss. While moving around on foot, the protagonist can beat up other character or use any of the three available weapons: a pistol, a uzi gun or a wrench. The wrench can also be used to remove the wheels from stationary cars to immobilize them.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bsokuy5sefwf5yybzpza.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Empire","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"New Media Generation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"IncaGold","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":66366,"name":"Shadowbane: Throne of Oblivion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Throne of Oblivion was the Second of two expansion packs to be added to Shadowbane.
