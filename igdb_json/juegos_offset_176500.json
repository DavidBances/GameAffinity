It was the first game in the Metal Gear series for the PSP. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile.\n\nAcid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character's movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \"Active Command Intelligence Duel\". The cards are not truly collectable, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs.\n\nBefore each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. Most cards are based on elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player's hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher.\n\nCost is an important factor in gameplay and can be summed up as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 15 and a guard has a cost of 10, then the guard's turn would occur before the character's.\n\nSome cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don't need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however, they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards.\n\nMultiplayer, or \"Link Battle\", is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running Acid can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a \"sneak-off\". The objective is to collect several diskettes before the rival player. Diskettes can be stolen by another player, so there is an emphasis on avoiding detection.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pnu.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami Computer Entertainment Japan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":10942,"name":"The Legend of Heroes II: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The third game in The Legend of Heroes series originally released for Japanese PCs in 1994 and then remade for the PSP in 2004.

The story opens with the death of Karegia's king, Ladras Lindblum, poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan: during his final moments, he releases his power into the world, causing many humans to become possessed by Force, including Veigue, Annie and Tytree.

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends.\nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether.\nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co53gv.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gameloft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"WildTangent","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Q Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":67211,"name":"I'm A Celebrity...
