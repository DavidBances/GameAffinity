Each territory also provides automatic income at regular intervals once it has been obtained.\n\nYellow territories are occupied by aliens and must first be cleared before they can be built upon. Each of these combat situations takes into account the player's attack and defense values and with each click, runs a combat simulation. If the player's health reaches 0, attack, defense, and recover are temporarily reduced to 0. The player must wait for these to return before attacking again. Once an enemy has been attacked, their health will regenerate over time.\n\nCash\nCash is rewarded each time an unoccupied territory is leveled up, and a smaller amount at regular intervals thereafter. Cash can be spent on buying upgrades that affect attack strength and defense level.\n\nLeveling\nThis is done automatically when the player collects enough XP. Once a level has been achieved, the player receives points that can be spent on attributes. The attributes are assigned at the right of the screen using the + buttons next to the three lines. The five available are Life, Attack, Defense, Recovery, and Cost.\n\nAction Points\nActions can only be performed when the player has enough points to spend on performing them. These can be seen in the purple bar on the right of the screen. Each action takes a number of points to perform, and these points are returned at a rate determined by the recovery score of the player.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6fh5.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nekogames","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":247531,"name":"Town of Salem 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Town of Salem 2 is the sequel to BlankMediaGames' hit Murder Mystery game, Town of Salem.
