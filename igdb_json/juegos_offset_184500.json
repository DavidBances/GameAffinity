It was released in two countries: France and Japan.\n\nNapoleon is a Japanese Game Boy Advance launch title developed by Genki and published Nintendo. The game is a real-time strategy, a genre which rarely appeared on consoles at the time, let alone portable platforms. Instead of being an omnipotent being, however, Napoleon lets one play as the historical French leader himself as he rides on horseback to command his troops in battle. Contrary to what the name might imply, the game itself is not historically accurate, as its missions sometimes incorporate things such as monster summons which the player much take care of.\n\nNapoleon's gameplay simplifies a number of real-time strategy game conventions while adding some of its own unique traits. Resource gathering, for example, is not a part of the gameplay directly, although there are still limitations imposed on unit building. Troop morale is another factor which the player must take into consideration to ensure that Napoleon's lackeys are fighting optimally. Not only is this a factor in the actual battles themselves, where Napoleon can sometimes utter a war cry, but it's also a component of the game before and after battles, as the lower-ranked commanders Napoleon also brings into battle with him must be monitored for sufficient morale.\n\nAdditionally, Napoleon can only command his troops by going to each one individually, with the exception of the units which are grouped with another commander. In that case, simply telling the commander what to do is enough to get all of his attached units moving. He can also heal some units and also be healed by sub-commanders as well. Perhaps most importantly of all, though, is the fact that Napoleon's mobility is limited to how fast his horse can travel; any major parts of the battle he needs to attend to must be commuted to manually, instead of more instantaneous methods employed by most other real-time strategy games.\n\nThe title is romanized as \"Napoleon\" in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6uy5.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Genki","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":6495,"name":"Konami Krazy Racers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Race your favorite Konami characters through 16 action packed, fun-filled courses on your way to the checkered flag! 16 challenging courses showcase the power of Game Boy Advance graphics, including Cyber Field, Ice Paradise, Pop 'n Beach, Skybridge, and many more! 8 Classic Konami characters to choose from, including Ninja from Metal Gear Solid, Dracula of Castlevania fame, and Goemon the Mystical Ninja.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4qw5.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":6424,"name":"GT Advance Championship Racing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Install your car kits, head to the track, start your engines and get ready to challenge the most competitive racers on the circuit!

Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled.

Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller.\n\nIf all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out.

Obtaining a crucial item, having a conversation with a specific character, or performing another action in the past will prevent Eike from getting killed.

For instance, \"enhanced\" asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas \"enhanced\" warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors.

Programmer Ron Surratt (Atari 2600 BurgerTime) and graphic artist Peggi Decarli (USCF Chess) drew up some initial concepts for the game (Ron's input was requested because he used to be a teacher), then Steve Ettinger was assigned as programmer. New-hire Joe Ferreira was added to train with Peggi as a graphics artist. Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a \"specialty\" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release. It never happened. \n \nSteve and Joe had proved themselves to be a formidable team, so they were chosen to design the top-secret experimental Intellivision game, Hover Force 3-D. \n \nEASTER EGG: Connect the twinkling stars above the carousel on the title screen to get SEE and JAF, Steve and Joe's initials.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pfn.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Intellivision"}]},{"id":40925,"name":"Ms. Space Fury","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This years’ Classic Gaming Expo and the 10th Anniversary of Digital Press happen to coincide. Obviously, DP wanted to do something special to mark the occasion. What better way than to release an original game for a classic system? Several game developers were contacted, but the job went to Daniel Bienvenu, who had written a few homebrews for ColecoVision (BUSTin Out, Dac-Man). Joe Santulli came up with the title and concept and provided support. A lot of people pitched in to help. Daniel brought in Sylvain (‘Sly DC’) De Chantal to design most of the levels and assist with the graphics. Marcel de Kogel wrote the emulator the game was compiled and tested on. As the project neared completion, Dave Giarrusso designed the artwork for the label and the instruction manual (as well as the full page advertisement shown in the last issue of DP as well as the CGE2K1 show program). Even veteran homebrew author John Dondzila lent his expertise on coding and debugging the program. Most of the communication and brainstorming was done via the Internet through email and instant messenger—something the designers of old didn’t have at their disposal.\n\nFinally, when the game was complete there were ten levels. After the game was downloaded to a ROM, it was discovered that it wouldn’t load an the actual console! After nearly giving coordinator Santulli a heart attack, John Dondzila was consulted and solved the problem. During his testing there were issues that had to be addressed such as heavy flickering and fatal errors. These were eventually worked out, and Santulli survived from near-coronary condition. Ironically when the bugs were fixed it freed up a lot of storage, so an additional ten levels were eventually added. There was not much time left but Santulli, with the aid of fellow CGE organizer and DP guy John Hardie managed to do the soldering and construction of 40 cartridges in time for a Classic Gaming Expo release.\n\nWhen the scheduled release time arrived at the show a long queue had formed. The games sold out within ten minutes. Even the promotional posters (with Dave G’s artwork) were taken. Most Expo-goers managed to at least play the demo that was set up. Their comments were consistently positive.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8wik.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Digital Press","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ColecoVision"}]},{"id":39861,"name":"Gunbarich","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Psikyos Gunbarich is a spinoff of Gunbird featuring Gunbirds protagonist Marion.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2tet.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":39669,"name":"Puzz Loop 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/f7ukvrhphpnwjat0iu2c.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mitchell Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":20466,"name":"Monster Racer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Choose your favourite monster from 10 fantastic creatures, each with their own ghastly traits.

It contains ports of \"Puyo Puyo\" and \"Puyo Puyo 2\", as well as a RPG-styled quest mode in which the player plays as Arle and battles against members of the other cast in Puyo Puyo matches. It also houses a \"Stage Clear\" mode in which you have to face either 10, 20, or 30 opponents, as well as two multiplayer modes which can be played with either other players or AI substitutes.\n\nFor the Quest mode itself, it allowed the player to customize the armory in ways in which made Arle stronger with a double-edged sword effect. You could remove the Puyo Rings in order to beef up her attack at the expense of being unable to see your next pieces for example, and the amount of experience gained and gold won was relative to how big a chain was scored and how quickly the opponent was defeated.\n\nThe key point in the Puyo Puyo gameplay of Box is that the player can choose a ruleset from either \"Puyo Puyo\", \"Puyo Puyo 2\", \"Puyo Puyo Sun\" and \"Puyo Puyo~n\". This can effectively lead to 4-player battles where each player plays with independent or mixed rules. This game also allowed for team battles to take place.

The player controls a Japanese man who stalks pretty girls. The game starts in \"adventure mode\" where the main character is looking for objects that he may need later. When he sees a girl that he likes, he attempts to follow her through the city, trying not to alert her about his presence and not to lose her at the same time. After the player successfully pursues the girl through several levels, he finally runs her down and is presented with a number of CG images, animation or an interactive 3D rape scene. But the ending depends on the choices that the player made in the beginning - there are romantic endings, sadistic endings, or the girl might just run away. There are 5 girls, each with unique images, city stalking levels and final scenes. Throughout the game, you encounter different obstacles that may alert the target of your presence.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/km6ge19q4w5ttezyvtom.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Illusion","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":6361,"name":"Crazy Arcade","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Crazy Arcade or Boom Online has a gameplay similar to Bomberman of Hudson Soft.

Kradion depends on imported food. When the great famine struck there was no food available and times were hard, so Kradion attacked Welfrad, all but destroying Welfrad's royal knight units. Just a few ace units survived because they were not in the capital when the attack came.\n\nAmong these is Ryuke, aka Blue Wing, chief knight of the royal army, who pilots the elemental fighter Huben Drake. The game starts with Ryuke separated from surviving units. He must survive and join his comrades to wage guerrilla war on the enemy.\n\nThe game consists of large-scale tactical battles, which are played on an isometrically viewed map, only part of which can be seen at once. There is a mini map in the lower left of the screen which shows the whole game area and the location of any other units, both friends and foe. During actual battles between units the game switches to a different view which displays the combat.
