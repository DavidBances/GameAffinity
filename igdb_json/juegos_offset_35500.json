The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream.\n\nThe gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\n\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\n\nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.\n\nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\n\nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\n\nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\n\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ba8.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo Koei Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Koei","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":38413,"name":"Ultimate Fighter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Get ready for furious fighting action with ULTIMATE FIGHTER!

We intended to deliver these words somewhat earlier, back when we covered Football Manager Handheld. Both games are, after all, football management sims based on popular PC forebears and revised for PSP, both were released around the same time, and indeed we started our reviewing in tandem.\n\nIt's just that Championship Manager 2006 has taken a little bit longer.\n\nThere are three reasons for this. The first is that, well, it's rather extensive. Whereas Football Manager Handheld opted for a cut-down, retro approach, Championship Manager 2006 goes the other way. It's every bit as huge as its PC parent, covering 55 leagues from the 12 leading footballing nations.\n\nGranted you can only play with the leagues of one country at a time, but each country has all the appropriate teams in all divisions, as well as reserve teams and youth squads. Each of the resultant 25,000 players has the usual mountain of statistics spread over five screens, detailing their skills, form and happiness, and they can all be trained, transfer-listed, praised or damned in the media, fined, demoted or promoted through the ranks, loaned or sold.\n\nThe transfer market is equally thorough, with a filtering system that enables you to search for specifically skilled players augmented by features like being able to scout or declare an interest in a player to unsettle them, and complex deals involving player-exchanges and sweeteners. With clubs negotiating deals or pulling out and media speculation and disgruntled footballers playing their part, Championship Manager 2006 feels real in a way that Football Manager Handheld didn't quite manage.\n\nThe matches themselves are equally involved affairs. There are six different ways to view the action, ranging from quick result to textual descriptions, possession bars, and a 2D match view complete with crowd sounds.\n\nThe latter is obviously the most tantalising attraction. When you're starting as a manager watching your charges (well, coloured circles) scurry around the pitch is even more hypnotic than viewing a mute pub TV, especially at the slowest speed. Combine this with more tactical options than Mourinho could ask for (custom formations, specific team and individual tactics, and even specific runs and passes for players to make) and you'll see how even pre-season friendlies can absorb hours.\n\nYou might also comprehend why it has taken us weeks of on-and-off play (and multiple recharges) to get through just a season. And though the more casual armchair manager might want to skip through things a little more rapidly (or even take advantage of the shorter Challenge mode), the faithful should be over the moon, Brian.\n\nSadly, the second reason for our delayed review – the interface – isn't as positive. At least ten per cent of our play time must have been frittered away getting to grips with it, and our first few attempts to navigate the hyperlink-strewn pages without a mouse were as frustrating as watching Lampard and Gerrard trying to play the same role in the England midfield. Whilst we did learn how to use shortcuts to ease this torment, the system (like Sven's formation) doesn't feel completely right.\n\nThe final reason for our tardiness? That's the trickiest. We've been reluctant to file our final review because we wanted to be sure how we felt.\n\nIn many ways, Championship Manager 2006 seems to have all the elements of a classic, but it just doesn't entirely convince us.\n\nPrincipally this is down to the match engine, which can feel like it's trying to recreate pinball rather than football. Stray passes, interceptions and the inability to beat players or shoot on target are all part of the real game, but the frequency of these events here in comparison to moments of flowing football are rather soul destroying.\n\nWorse, there's a distinct feeling that the result you get from watching a match is different to that from a quick result, with reported matches offering far more goals than games you play through. Extreme tactical tinkering can help alleviate the situation, but the base level of difficulty seems less forgiving than Alex Ferguson.\n\nAdd to this glitches such as substituted players seeming to reappear, goals being credited to the wrong player and the way certain teams (like Chelsea) seem unbeatable, and what could have been a life-consuming joy becomes an oddly addictive love-hate relationship, as your hopes are raised then dashed and still you come back for more (perhaps it should be called Football Fan Simulator?).\n\nUltimately, Championship Manager 2006 really is a game of two halves, one of which promises glory of Champions League proportions, while the other has a tendency to deliver conference fare. If next season's outing raises its game on the pitch, it really could be deserving of its 'championship' name.

The flyer may give the impression that it uses an isometric perspective but it uses the same overhead view as the first six Pac-Man titles - and, the player must use a 4-directional joystick to take control of a yellow racer car (the eponymous \"Van-Van Car\"), which is on a mission to burst balloons with its front-mounted spike while watching out for the three \"killer\" cars (which are red, green, and blue, so the last one looks somewhat like an evil version of the car from Namco's Rally-X).\n\nEach normal balloon burst will be worth 200 points, regardless of colour; also, if you press that \"Jump Button\", Van-Van Car will jump into the air, and every time it jumps over one of the killer cars, you will receive 100 points.

Once you press the Jump Button while in possession of it, Van-Van Car will fire it - and it will destroy any balloons (and killer cars) it ploughs through, for 200 and 1000 points respectively. It is also not advisable to burst another energy balloon until you have fired the missile as Van-Van Car can only hold one at a time, and the killer cars cannot pass over the balloons and will be forced to go around them; the killer cars will also not chase directly after Van-Van Car immediately and will only do so after a preset number of balloons have been burst or a preset amount of time has passed. Finally, Van-Van Car will start spinning around in a clockwise direction at twice its normal speed when it passes over an oil slick - and even though it loses its jump power, it will quickly be able to get away from the killer cars, especially when they are close behind it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co80kd.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":38557,"name":"Video Hustler","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A pool game initially released by Konami in 1981 for the arcade.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co96es.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":38558,"name":"Wiping","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wiping is a Maze / Digging game developed by Nichibutsu for the Arcade.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7pl0.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jorudan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nichibutsu","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":38559,"name":"Wonder Momo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wonder Momo is a loose parody of a typical Ultraman-style superhero series, and utilizing a then-rare female protagonist.

The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \"Namco Theater\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.\n\nAs Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \"Wonder\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.\n\nThe game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt.

The difficulty curve of the game increases significantly after the first level and can be somewhat unforgiving.\n\nPower ups are available in the form of small pink pods on the ground which when shot release a coloured orb into the air, which can do one of the following: make Mutron-kun very large and invincible for a short period, transform Mutron-kun into multiple creatures, award extra points or grant increased fire power in a scatter shot pattern.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8gk4.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"UPL","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":38563,"name":"Nova 2001","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Nova 2001 is an arcade shooter released by Universal in 1984.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4o34.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Universal Co., Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"UPL","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":38564,"name":"Rescue Raider","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You pilot an armed vehicle that is trying to gather secret plans.
