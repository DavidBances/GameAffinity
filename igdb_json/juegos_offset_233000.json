A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come.”\n\nIOI added: “For many, this journey is also a deeply personal one that began long before we started making games for a living – and it started with the fantasy genre. From the ‘Fighting Fantasy’ books compelling you to choose your path, alone, against wizards, lizards, and thief kings. To the togetherness, camaraderie, agony, and delight found around the tabletop.\"\n\n“For some it meant taking the role of a game master: Part storyteller, part AI opponent, part guide, part villain. For everyone around that table it meant creativity, imagination, building a world together, and a shared goal in creating a great game experience.\"\n\n“This idea – that a diverse group of individuals with different skills and strengths can work together and become more than the sum of their parts – is what inspires us. It inspires the fantasy world we are building – and it inspires how we build it.”","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ogx.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":254854,"name":"Farming Simulator: Farm, Tractor, Experience Logic Games - Nintendo Switch Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Farmer Simulator is the ultimate combination of fun, strategy, and brain-teasing gameplay.
