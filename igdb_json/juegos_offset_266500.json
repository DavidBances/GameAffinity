Many things such as level design and characters were changed drastically, and some levels from the original were removed altogether. New levels and characters were introduced, the cutscenes are completely original, and the game was given a much more comical, cartoon-like style as opposed to the Gothic horror-comedy of the original. The soundtrack is completely orchestrated, and half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending; Dan still goes to the Hall of Heroes regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices. The game also features a variety of voice talent, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7tjj.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SCE Cambridge Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":288666,"name":"Atta: Spot the Oddities in the Strange Hotel","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome to Room 1028 of the Despair Hotel!

This involves accounting for your present height (1-6), so that the bombs will explode with the most markers within the blast range (the red area in centre of your targeting site) when the bombs hit the ground. Therefore, at higher heights you must release your bombs sooner, since it takes more time for them to fall, so that they will hit the ground when the target markers are in the centre of your site.

It is a physical release and an expanded version of the original \"Raid on TriCity\" that was download only.\n\nThe player controls a space ship on a playfield similar to the one of Tetris. The ship can freely be moved around the area as long as its part of a stacked block. New Tetrominoes drop down from the top of the screen. They cannot be moved or rotated, but they can be shot brick by brick. Scoring is done by creating lines, so careful shooting is required to either destroy the block completely or to make parts fit the gaps in the playfield to stack them properly and create lines. The shooting itself does not affect the score. Some of the falling blocks contain power-ups or enemies that can be destroyed or drop to add to the stack. Power-ups such as bombs can become dangerous when lines are formed and enemies restrict movement when part of the stack and can then only be taken out through lines. When the blocks reach a threshold near the top of the screen, the game is over.\n\nEEPROM on the cartridge is used to save the game and store highscores. Also new to this release is the Story mode. It splits the gameplay into separate levels with a fixed goal to complete them, a narrative about aliens where the player has to save Congis Space Station and the AC2-K11 sector of the Galaxy, and some interactivity with a branching level path. The gameplay for Story is similar to the Arcade mode but there the only goal is to beat the highscore.\n\nThe playfield only takes up about 50% of the screen in the center. On the left there is a picture showing a control element of a space ship and the right part contains the HUD elements. In the Story mode the HUD shows the remaining time, the level objective such as the number of lines, bombs and bugs, and the number of bullets you can shoot at the same time. In the Arcade mode the HUD shows the score, the number of lines, the current level and the number of bullets you can shoot at the same time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8e4r.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Fadest","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Yastuna Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari Lynx"}]},{"id":289130,"name":"Zombie Madness","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"One Halloween morning, your son crashes the lawnmower into the neighbor’s shed.\nStrangely, the neighbor doesn’t seem mad, but he gives your son a juju.\nThis results in your house being invaded by zombies!\nOne at a time, you must carry your family members downstairs to the exits of the house.\nIf a zombie touches you, you’ll have to eat some human flesh to survive.
