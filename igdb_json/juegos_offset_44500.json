Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.\nFinally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ovt.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Absolute Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Imagineering, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":48244,"name":"Solstice: The Quest for the Staff of Demnos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"From Out of the Darkness...

To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.)

Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers.

There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed.

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year. Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form. Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players. Enhanced pitch control. Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams. You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5. Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders.

Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\n\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field.

Besides interrogating people for information, or simply beating them up for train fare, Holmes must search seemingly random cracks or trees in order to find important clues, or inventory items.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/e24xokztvfmkcgqqxdlm.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Towa Chiki","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48397,"name":"Shadow Brain","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shadow Brain is a Role-Playing game, developed by Scitron & Art and published by Pony Canyon, which was released in Japan in 1991.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4p77.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Scitron & Art Inc","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Pony Canyon","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48398,"name":"Seirei Gari","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Seirei Gari is an Adventure game, developed by Advance Communication Company and published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1989.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7iv4.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Advance Communication Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48399,"name":"Seikima II: Akuma no Gyakushuu!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Seikima II Akuma no Gyakushuu! is a video game that was released in Japan in 1986.\n\nThe game is based on a then-popular Japanese heavy metal band formed by Damian Hamada called Seikima-II.

He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of GeGeGe no Kitaro: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.\n\nGeGeGe no Kitaro 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.\n\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5y56.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tose","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48487,"name":"Ganso Saiyuuki: Super Monkey Daibouken","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sun Wukong must assist the Buddhist monk Xuanzang with his task of collecting some sūtras as they make the treacherous voyage from China to India.

Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/updbvu7iolbex0laxd2z.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ASCII Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48494,"name":"Fighting Road","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fighting Road is an Action game, developed and published by Toei Animation, which was released in Japan in 1988.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co740m.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Toei Animation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48495,"name":"Famista '89: Kaimaku Ban!!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Famista '89: Kaimaku Ban!! is a Sports game, developed and published by Namco, which was released in Japan in 1989.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/m6zgnp1ifh4pxnu0ffnu.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namcot","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48496,"name":"Family Quiz 4-nin wa Rival","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Family Quiz 4-nin wa Rival (ファミリークイズ 4人はライバル? lit.

A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\n\nThe key of time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within.

Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from.

Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co50b0.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NOW Production","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48598,"name":"Youkai Club","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Youkai Club is an Action game, developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1987.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co95q2.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jaleco","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tose","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48599,"name":"World Boxing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"World Boxing is a Sports game, developed by Natsume and published by TSS, which was released in Japan in 1990.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6oyd.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48600,"name":"Woody Poko","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player controls an old wooden figure named \"This Baggage.\"\n\nHe is a hero who has lived in harmony with humans for many years.
