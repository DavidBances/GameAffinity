When it was re-released for the Playstation, the graphics were uncensored but toned down script remained. Then came Final Fantasy VI Advance with a newer (though some consider drier) translation, but the color palette and music were altered for the handheld console. Others have made re-translations, such as the great work by RPGOne, Lina Darkstar, and Kwhazit.\n\nNow this is Final Fantasy VI: Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition. The goal was to make the SNES version uncut and to clean up the script but keep the nuance used by Woolsey in the original game’s release. Using the original Woolsey script as a basis to analyze, the entire game was looked through, line by line, using FFVI Advance, RPGOne, and Lina Darkstar to accomplish this. Recently, the game’s script was also heavily analyzed by Kwhazit and Mato (Legends of Localization). With these newer and more heavily detailed looks into the game, the script was again updated to provide a much more accurate version while still remaining true to the original game’s release.\n\nAlso used was various tools and patches to uncensor the graphics, restore Character Class names, extend spell names, rename monsters and items, and make hopefully the version of Final Fantasy VI that everyone will play.\n\nAny bug fixes or additions that were used were chosen not for any balance changes, but to fix persistent issues in the game, as to not change the experience of the original too much. This even includes the long list used in the optional Bug-Fix versions of the game.\n\nAdditional Add-Ons are also optionally included. These tweaks bring an overall complete experience that many would say should have been in the original game to begin with.\n\nThe Music Player included with the game has been altered for compatibility with Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ka7.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Rodimus Primal","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":238889,"name":"Hareraiser II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Exploring a possible alternate reality for Hareraiser (1984), a controversial and nonsensical game with a treasure hunt behind it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co66ga.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bagenzo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":217822,"name":"LumberReborn","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This is a game about creating a forest from nothing and selling the wood for profit!
