At this time, the game already was completely finished.\n\nIn Bound High!, Chalvo, the bouncing robot, travels through space In full 3d-D motion in pursuit of alien invaders that threaten the peaceful inhabitants of Earth. Angling from above, players control rolled up Chalvo, who must destroy all enemies on the playfield by landing on them and throwing them down from the playfield. Falling off the playfield himself, Chalvo will loose a life.\nThe playfield is in space, or high above the earth, and is made of many little squares, which are composed differently from level to level, once big plain areas, once many small, scattered blocks. Bouncing over the platforms can be quite incalculable and dangerous, while some are solid, other ones vanish after one hit or reveal puzzles, items or other objects and besides a lot of different enemies, Chalvo also has to carefully avoid winds, the deep crevices, sharp spikes and highly charged electric \"shockers\" that cause his demise. Adding to the difficulty is the rebound angle when you hit a moving enemy - you don't necessarily bounce straight up in the air.\nSometimes blocks lead to an \"Another Stage\", some kind of mirrored parallel universe with inverted colors and without the dangerous winds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6qql.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Virtual Boy"}]},{"id":50595,"name":"Space Pinball","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Pinball","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Space Pinball is the name given to the prototype that would eventually become Galactic Pinball.

The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.[1] \n \nGameplay[edit] \nAt the start of the game, Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries and steal these ingredients from him.[2] After the opening level, the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.[2] Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies in the guise of walking sausages, eggs, pickles, and spoons. Players have the ability to spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds, allowing players to escape.[2] Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below.[3] \n \nThe platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle).[3] As the player progresses in the game, more enemies are added.[citation needed] Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to either trap them between the falling burger ingredients or to temporarily freeze them with pepper.[citation needed] However, players can only a small supply of pepper at any given time (4 bottles could be carried).[2] Players can pick up coffee cups or ice creams that appear on the screen (when they are down to their last pepper pot), rewarding them with an extra pepper pot.[2] Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.[citation needed]","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":46065,"name":"Adventures in Letter Land with Jack & Jill","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":46064,"name":"Can Can Bunny Premiere 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kw5.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":46040,"name":"E.T.X.: The Extra Terrestrial Xargon","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A ZX Spectrum clone of Atari's ET game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kg3ryhtojl17al5isace.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":46038,"name":"Train Game","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":45987,"name":"Street Master","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":45978,"name":"Xtom 3d","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Xtom 3D is a 3D arcade shooter.

In order to develop this understanding, students must have the opportunity to practice, for only through practice can they develop strong mathematical skills. The Computer Math Games VI Solid State Cartridge is one of five modules of math games that can help provide this opportunity.

The games included in the cartridge are both fun and challenging, with an entertaining, motivating format designed to capture and hold attention. With this cartridge students will be able to: \n- develop math skills by playing four different, enjoyable math games using whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and integers. \n- have fun while practicing mathematics either alone or with other players or team members. \n- develop methods of problem-solving and decision-making. \nThe cartridge is designed to be versatile. It can be used in the home as well as the classroom. The team-use concept allows the cartridge to be used by large numbers of participants, and yet it is equally valuable to your child working alone at home to supplement lectures and homework. The cartridge is intended to be a supplementary aid for children from grades two through nine. It is assumed that the students have been exposed to basic math concepts. While even very young students can use the activities covering addition and subtraction of whole numbers, the cartridge can grow in application as your child grows in ability.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44356,"name":"Decimals 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44355,"name":"Decimals","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Children need strong math skills to solve today's and tomorrow's problems.

The computer never tires of repetition or loses patience — it's like having a private math tutor! The Milliken Math Sequences, developed for Texas Instruments by Milliken Publishing Company, consists of twelve Solid State Cartridges. Each cartridge concentrates on a different skill area in mathematics, such as addition, subtraction, decimals, or fractions. By providing different levels of difficulty, the series is suitable for children from the kindergarten age through grade eight. The Decimals cartridge is divided into 56 levels of difficulty, covering material generally taught in grades five through eight. The program provides practice in recognizing decimals as fractions, determining the order of decimals, rounding decimals, and doing arithmetic with decimals. Children add, subtract, multiply, and divide while developing the special skills involved in working with decimal numbers. This program assumes that your child has mastered basic arithmetic and a certain degree of mental computation.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44354,"name":"Demolition Division","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44353,"name":"Demonstration","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Demonstration module has been carefully developed to provide a quick, thorough, enjoyable, and easy-to-use demonstration of the Texas Instruments Home Computer.

The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments. \n \nThe game does not attempt to understand the singer's words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song. \n \nThe songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the SingStar series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos, where available. However, the 2009 remake of the game (titled Karaoke Revolution, just like the original) features all master tracks.[2]","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":43489,"name":"RTL Biathlon 2007","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8diw.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":43480,"name":"SXR: Snow X Racing","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":43471,"name":"ESPN NFL 2K4","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":43468,"name":"Rhythmic Star!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":43451,"name":"DJ: Decks & FX","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":43398,"name":"Short Track Racing: Trading Paint","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Strap yourself in and burn up the track in 7 ruthless vehicle classes.

Gone are the limits of power restrictions, limited classes, and qualifying rounds. Players simply choose their vehicle from a massive range – including dirt bikes, ATVs, sand rails, rally cars, monster trucks, and everything in between – then hit the track in a no-holds-barred sprint to the finish line. Carving a swathe of destruction through the ever-changing wilderness, players must compete in a gasoline-fuelled, horsepower spectacle where the only rule is to try and stay alive.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rq5.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":42993,"name":"Kidou Senshi Gundam Extreme VS: Full Boost","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":42968,"name":"World Championship Off Road Racing","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Drive the most powerful off-road vehicles in this hair-raising quest for sand supremacy!

It’s not just a simple race, though; it reminds me more of a kart racer. You have special power-ups that give you a speed boost and make you jump.
