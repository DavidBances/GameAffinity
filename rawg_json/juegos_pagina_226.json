Game developers will be able to make games in the style of classics like Metal Slug or Braid, combined with the gameplay and visual appeal made possible by moving or otherwise changing light sources. This is achieved by the artist painting an object lit from several directions, images called 'lighting profiles', and then processing them into normal maps, depth maps, ambient occlusion maps, and a few others. Sprite Lamp also includes a variety of shaders designed to get the most out of these maps.How it worksSprite Lamp is all about letting artists paint images in a form they are familiar with, and using those images to create the more difficult or counterintuitive maps that are required by modern shaders. This primarily takes the form of painting the same subject lit from a few different directions - between two and five - and processing these images to create a normal map and a depth map.RenderingSprite Lamp includes a preview window and various shader options to let you experiment and find out what looks best with your artwork. Sprite Lamp's shaders are included in Sprite Lamp in GLSL form, fully commented, and can be used as a base for including them in your own game. A growing list of Sprite Lamp shaders for common game engines is available at http://engines.spritelamp.com.

Surviving aboard the Tin Can is no trivial matter. Without a good look at the systems surrounding you, your onboard manual and patience, the only thing awaiting you is a cold (or hot) cosmic death.\nConsider yourselves warned. Good luck!\nAbout the Game\"In space, tech support can't hear you scream!\"Get your hands dirty!\n\"What a mess! The oxygen generator refuses to start up...I hope it's just the fuse cutting down the power and not some kind of issue with the atomic pile!\"\nAll the systems inside your escape pod are made up of many different components, from fuses to air filters. They are all interconnected and have their own critical function.Listen to your body!\n\"My vision has been blurry for a while now and it's getting worse! I really need to find that leak before I pass out!\"\nWhen all your systems are failing, in the dark, only the sound of your heartbeat and your shallow breathing will alert you of your imminent death. O², CO², atmospheric pressure, and temperature are realistically simulated for maximum immersion.Your life hangs by a thread...don't lose focus!\n\"These incomprehensible error codes again!? Where is the damn manual? This pod’s a mess! Ah! Here it is!\"\nThe manual inside your pod is filled with detailed information that could very well save your life.Plan ahead!\n\"What a view! Is it me or it is getting hot in here, though?\"\nFrom asteroid fields to nebulae, these cosmic monsters will wreak havoc on your systems and won’t give you a lot of time to breathe...\nGood luck!Strong Points\nManage pod systems down to every single component.\nNumerous systems which all have their own unique function and serve to ensure your survival. Every system is interconnected, from the oxygen generator to the emergency lights.\nOver a dozen different components, all having their own specific function and causing different problems when damaged. Ex : Defective buttons won’t trigger properly when pressed, while faulty electrical connectors won’t deliver enough power.\nOrganic failures thanks to the simulated nature of resources and components inside the game. You will have to figure out what is wrong and retrace failures back to the source.\nDismantle, swap and fix anything inside the pod.\nRealistic management of vital resources, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature and radiation. There are no arbitrary numbers here. The levels of these resources required for survival are based on real life!\nAn onboard manual providing detailed information about your escape pod.\nReal medical symptoms instead of health bars. For example, hypoxia (lack of oxygen) will make you breathe faster and stronger, will make your vision blurry and will slow down your movements until you fall unconscious.\nCosmic events will strike your pod and will have different types of impact on its systems. From flying near the surface of a star that will cause overheating to asteroid fields that will pierce your hull, you need to anticipate and deal with the situations as they come to avoid certain death.Background:As a random member of your colony's space program, you leave Mars aboard a large transport ship, only for its reactor to go critical in the middle of your journey to new horizons. All your time spent in the simulator did not prepare you for such a dire situation! Now, drifting in your escape pod, without any FTL capabilities, you realize that an easy way out was not included. Use your own wits to fix systems in a similar way you would fix and build your own PC, by swapping and fixing individual components. With a bit of luck, you might be able to finally find a safe haven.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2022,"developer":"Tin Can Studio","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC"}]},{"id":688844,"name":"Lunar's Chosen","genre":"Casual","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/302/30229ac7e3e072e8fd3bb6d04b1a3640.jpg","description":"Lunar's Chosen is a fantasy based, story heavy, adult game.\nPlay as the main character who is bestowed the ability to read minds by the Goddess Lunar, but that's not all his power can do, even if he doesn't know it yet.\nHelp him discover more about his abilities and the people around him as he navigates this new found power.
