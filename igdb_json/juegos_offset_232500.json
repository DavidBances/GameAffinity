Touch was a free-to-play mobile puzzle video game for iOS and Android.\n\nThe game featured the never-before-seen mechanic of \"Paint to Clear\", which players had to drag to copy the color of Puyo to adjacent ones trying to make 4 or more connect. A clear with 5 or more connected makes an arrow (やじるし) available to make long-reaching clears later. All characters were also able to make use of skills to create arrows and other special items to aid in the puzzle.\n\nOn September 30 2016, the service of Puyo Puyo!! Touch was announced to terminate after November 30 2016, making it impossible to play the game after that date.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6kl5.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sonic Team","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":251501,"name":"Puyo Puyo Fever Touch","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Puyo Puyo Fever Touch is a puzzle game published by Sega for Android, iOS and Windows Mobile 6.5 devices.
