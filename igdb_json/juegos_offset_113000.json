Play as one of the Forsaken, the last frontier of humanity against the growing horrors of the Omnistructure. As you find yourself stranded in a faraway outpost, you must adapt in order to survive. The world won't wait for you though, you must venture into the unknown - your faith will decide your fate.\n\nFeel the burden of surviving in one of the last remaining outposts of the Forsaken, a legion of hunters condemned to protect the last vestige of humanity. The nature of your purpose however is shrouded in mystery, and as you delve deeper into the manifold halls of the Omnistructure, you will come to find the true meaning of alienation, isolation, and dread. A cross between cyberpunk, and dark fantasy - Bleak Faith will offer a story and experience that will be a breath of fresh air for all gamers looking for a something new. The world is full of lore, and every aspect of it is crafted with utmost passion and a dedication to art. As a baseline there is an estimated 30+ hours of content, a deep class system, and a procedural AI system that ensures that no playthrough is ever the same.\n\nThe architecture of the world, the Omnistructure, is a huge aspect of the game. Meticulously designed and crafted, Bleak Faith aims to provide an emergent narrative method coupled with more structured traditional moments. The world of Bleak Faith is labyrinthine, tapping into an innate curious instinct we all have when faced with many defined branching choices - we focus on creating a strong sense of curiosity about the path not taken, by offering unique and compelling content in every area of the world - having said that the world employs both vast open areas, and more linear openness in Metroidvania fashion. The aim is to evoke that same feeling of wonder and excitement that you felt the first time you played a game, the first time you experienced 3D graphics, the first time you experienced something that felt formative and not habitual. Open world in Bleak Faith is a crucial aspect to showing you the reality of the Forsaken. In this world there are few havens for the Forsaken, and these are generally outposts which serve as bases (of various complexities and utility) to recover from journeys and prepare for more - however, nowhere is truly safe!\n\nExpect tight and meticulously crafted and expanded combat that brings tempo and action to this world in amazing quality and detail. We're not shying away from a challenge, and so we're going all in. Despite being a small team, we couldn't accept a simple mundane combat system; we are making it fleshed out, and very robust. The combat communicates the danger in adrenaline-pumping fashion. Fast, responsive, and unforgiving - you will earn and feel every victory, nothing comes easy. Approach combat in your own way however - choose stealth over face-to-face combat, choose ranged over melee, choose Technomancy over more traditional combat styles. The system allows you to express yourself through combat, or through avoiding it - and that's further supported through a class system as well.\n\nHow better to experience the unyielding uncertainty of the Omnistructure than through a simulated ecosystem of factions and AI groups. Inhabitants of the Omnistructure will compete among themselves, grow and expand, change and adapt - the food chain in the ecosystem will, as a result, mold to every playthrough (e.g. an apex predator from your last playthrough might have already died out in this playthrough and you never fight it again). It's a constant race against time as enemies will try and outgrow and outsmart not only you, but other competition. Hunt, scavenge, and grow to stay on top of the food chain. Never experience an area the same way as the procedural nature of the ecosystem will ensure that you can never let your guard down. Having said that, there are still linear areas of the game, especially those that cover main plot points - to ensure a direction and purpose for the player. The ecosystem makes every moment of gameplay interesting and engaging - even on multiple playthroughs.\n\nFight against the odds, and stay alive despite the Omnistructure's evergrowing threat. Craft, scavenge, hunt, and find ways to excel. Pick a class, upgrade stats, augment your character, create equipment and stay healthy. Resist the Puppet Plague, and the many afflictions present in the world which can change the outcome of your journey entirely. Use stealth and your environment to your advantage - fighting is not always the best course of action, and when it is, preparing the field to shift the odds in your favor is a necessary tactic.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3mcx.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Archangel Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}]},{"id":122201,"name":"Blitzkrieg","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Blitzkrieg is a tough-as-nails tower defence game from Loui Studios.

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.\n\nJigsaw Sudoku:\n\nThe rules of Jigsaw Sudoku are similar to standard Sudoku since you must place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to whatever the size of the puzzle is) into each of the rows and columns. However, whereas standard Sudoku also has rectangular boxes that must each contain every number, in Jigsaw Sudoku these boxes are replaced by different bold-lined shapes that must each contain every number instead. \n\nKiller Sudoku:\n\nKiller Sudoku puzzles include all the rules of regular Sudoku but add in dashed-line 'cages' which must sum to given values. Killer Sudoku is also sometimes known as Sumdoku, Mathdoku or Addoku. The name 'Killer' Sudoku arises because of the wicked twist on the standard Sudoku puzzle, since you must not only place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to the size of the puzzle) into each of the rows, columns, and bold-lined 3x3 (or other sizes) boxes but you must also place the numbers into each dashed-line cage so that they add up to its given total - and without repeating a digit in a dashed-line cage.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co202y.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"indienova","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konstructors Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":122323,"name":"LEGO Hidden Side","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hidden Side invites kids to join a fearless team of ghost hunters, who dare see the unseen and help turn a haunted world back to normal, one ghost at a time.

All the first-run copies of the game came with a Tatacon, a small plastic drum which is identical in functionality to the bigger arcade drums. As for the future console Taiko titles, the game can also be played with buttons as the alternative control scheme. \n \nDue to the first arcade versions relying on the PS1-grade Namco System 10 board, the game has PS1-grade graphics and longer load times in order to reproduce a good arcade fidelity. For the same reason, the arcade-styled Arcade mode (together with unique ending/Game Over sequences) was ported for the game, together with the (then popular) Battle mode. Arcade mode is also the staple for unlocking secret tracks, for this and the next 3 console games. \n \nThe console-exclusive features added to the first console Taiko game were a Free mode for playing the songs without the song selection constrains of the Arcade mode, the fast-button pressing Don-Chan Race (the first in many Taiko games for Ps2) and the Safari Mode. Free mode also features console-exclusive options, such as custom Taiko sounds selection and an Auto-Play function for every song, which can be toggled on and off by pressing the Select button in the song selection screen. \n \nAbout Safari mode, it plays much like the Donkey Konga games' Survival mode, in which players clear a number of randomly-chosen songs on a set difficulty, starting with the Tamashii gauge full (and not able to recover ticks from errors). The number of songs changes according to the difficulty selected, and the Safari run is won if the Tamashii gauge isn't empty during the play by missing notes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2tpr.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco Bandai Studios Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taiko Team","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":122539,"name":"Uncrossed","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":122540,"name":"The Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage - Pickled Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5qc3.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"VIS Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"BAM!
