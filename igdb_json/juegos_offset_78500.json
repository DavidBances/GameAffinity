The game is played using 5 buttons; move left, move right, scream, jump, and drop a slice. Different enemies have different strengths, so some may require multiple screams to eliminate. Screaming is not only good for damaging enemies, Loaf's scream can also push levers and propel himself across water. Loaf is made up of 5 slices, Loaf has the ability to leave slices behind and re-join with them later, any dropped slices will scream at the same time as the control slice. More points are scored for completing levels quickly, so dropping slices in next to where enemies are about to spawn is useful to defeat them more efficiently. Dropping slices plays a big part in puzzle solving too. Slices also act as health, a slice is lost from Loaf upon enemy collision. Beware though, each slice you drop gives Loaf one less slice of protection.
