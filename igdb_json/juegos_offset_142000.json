The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours.\n\nProcedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode.Know Your Neighbors.\nIn Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings.\n\nTailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your ship’s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Void’s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel.\n\nBe the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a ‘good guy’? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed.Intense Active Combat.\nTarget enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship.Take Direct Control Of Your\n\nKinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview; or Mouse Flight-mode, allowing direct control of the ship through mouse movements. Control your battleship’s turrets from a sweeping orbital camera or slip between asteroids in a dogfight while piloting your heavy-fighter using mouse flight mode. Switch between modes at any time to best suit the situation.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2t3d.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Badland Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":10566,"name":"Motorama: Classic Racing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Go back in time and experience “The Fabulous Fifties” in a game that relives the period, vehicles and street races of the legendary 50´s films.

Excavate the foundation of a house with realistic machines, pour concrete into the wall panels of a factory with an enormous concrete pump, or test the steadiness of your hands by placing gigantic roof trusses with a mobile crane. Thanks to the realistic controls, you can steer an excavator with two joysticks using SAE controls and feel as if you are working on a real construction site.\n\nExplore an expansive, freely navigable world with various towns, fields, and even a highway – you will find a variety of new challenges for your constantly growing motor pool. Try out new vehicles before you buy them at the construction machine dealer, have repairs done at the repair shop, and visit the local city hall for public calls for tenders. If you are successful, then even larger and more lucrative jobs and various office locations with even more possibilities will beckon.\n\nWork is more fun with friends, and construction is no exception. Operate vehicles with friends in multiplayer mode, and complete construction missions together or just play around in the wide-open game world.\n\nUp to four workers can participate in multiplayer games. The player who opens the game serves as the host and takes the lead role in running a construction company shared by the other players in a cooperative game.\n\nIn a single game, you can work together to accomplish construction tasks. Dig pits together using multiple excavators, while another player transports the excavated material to a gravel plant. In an advanced game, you can work on up to three construction sites at one time and really start raking in money with your construction company.\n\nAre 200 working stages in over 150 different missions not enough for you? The Construction Simulator 2015 offers plenty of opportunities to integrate your own vehicles and construction sites into the game. You can use the developer’s own Construction Kit to shape your own worlds and create your own game content.\n\nYou can of course also share your mods with the wider community of fans through Steamworks or on fan sites. This way, a huge community of players can access an endless and varied supply of user-created content.\n\nThe barrier to entry into the world of modding is not particularly high – all you really need is a 3D graphics program like 3ds max or Maya as well as the free version of Unity3D.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3wjj.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"astragon Entertainment GmbH","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Excalibur Publishing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"weltenbauer.

Seen a player hanging next to a precarious precipice. One single shot of your gun...and down he goes to his death.\nThere's just something so primal, so simple, so fun about that.\n\nPush is a Last Man Standing gameplay modification replicating exactly that. In Push, your goal is simple: Knock enemies off onto instant-death floors, and stay on the arena as long as possible. Gameplay emphasizes skill and quick reflexes above all else. Get accurate and knock enemies off into pits. Figure out how to survive being thrown into the abyss. Think fast and act faster, and you just might be the last one standing.\nYou're given absolute minimal equipment so you can focus on strategy. Laser guns that do no damage but have extremely high knockback, Primary fire shoots a laser that doesn't do a lot of push, but is very accurate and very, very fast. Secondary fire lobs an energy grenade that has short range and arcs downward, but has massive amounts of knockback and can rocketjump like nothing else. Gauntlets that can send people careening off into the distance with a single (lucky) blow. And a double-jump to help with recovery.\n\nIt's all so simple. So, so simple.

Ranged weapons, melee weapons, armor, special attacks, ally / PC healing, and more have been reworked and carefully tested to create an engaging and challenging combat experience.  Even the core combat system has been tweaked so that AC is calculated before damage reduction; this change makes combat more consistent and more fair, and corrects the “invincible” armor problem.\n\nSmarter AI: Medic, Guard, Grenadier, Sniper, and more - New AI behaviors and schemas exist for human enemies, making them more interesting and more challenging to fight!  Enemies will notice your presence more quickly, follow you around corners and through doors, and fully utilize all of their tactical options, thrown weapons, and special attacks.\n\nNew PC Infection option on New Game menu: Create a new game with PC Infection checked and your character will be as susceptible to infection as your allies are.  Carefully manage your antibiotics and change your combat strategies to ensure your own survival!\n\nHardcore Mode: Just in case living in the apocalypse wasn’t hard enough for you.  In Hardcore mode combat becomes more dangerous, allies consume more resources and heal more slowly, and Morale is harder to keep up.  Turn on Hardcore, Iron Man, and PC Infection for the ultimate challenge.\n\nAlarms: That’s right - we’ve added alarms to buildings in several areas.  Red, blinking lights warn you that there’s an active alarm on a building. Use your Science skill to deactivate an alarm and prevent a looting distraction from becoming a noisy attraction.\n\nNew areas and random encounters: Several new levels and random encounters have been added.  Make sure to keep an eye out for the Chemical Plant, an area with a unique twist…\n\nNew combat sounds and animations: We’ve added new special attack, reloading, and healing animations and sounds.  Special attacks feel smoother and more impactful now.\n\nStability improvements: We’ve rooted out every crash and progress blocking bug to make sure you have the smoothest possible experience.  Several popularly requested usability improvements have been added, such as friendly fire conformation, looting piled up bodies, and an option to toggle Live Shelter movement on and off.\n\nPathfinding improvements: Both allies and the undead have received major pathfinding adjustments that will reduce lag some people have experienced as well as make movement more consistent and natural.About the GameAbout the Game\nDead State is a compelling, high-tension survival RPG set in central Texas at the collapse of civilization and the dawn of the undead apocalypse.\n\nAs society is beginning to fall apart, the player must organize a group of survivors together, fortify a shelter, scout for food and supplies, negotiate with or defend against other factions, and maintain order inside the shelter as humanity teeters on the brink of extinction. Dead State is a full-fledged RPG featuring base building and management, turn-based tactical combat, and reactive story and dialogue with an emphasis on survival at any cost. \n\nAttract new allies, scavenge food and supplies, and protect your shelter at any cost.
