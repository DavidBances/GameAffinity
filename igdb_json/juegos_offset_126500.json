Tolkien’s Middle-earth that has been continuously running, enhanced, and remastered since fall of 1991. In MUME, players are encouraged to role-play as they live in this meticulously crafted world exploring the conflict leading into the War of the Ring during the late Third Age. The action takes place nearly 100 years prior to The Hobbit but long after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key to Erebor has just been found by Gandalf in Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take place.\n\nMUME covers 28,000+ original rooms from the mighty Dwarven Halls beyond the Gulf of the Lhûn in the West to the Mountains of Mirkwood in the East, and from the ruins of Fornost Erain in the North to the fortress of Isengard in the South.\n\nPlayers can choose among several different races, each with some unique characteristics. The races are separated into three striving factions. Dwarves, Elves, Half-Elves, Hobbits and Men — among them are the shapeshifting Beornings — are eternally at war with the Orcs, Trolls and Black Númenóreans. Moreover, the orkish tribe of the Zaugurz is trying to expand its territory at the expense of the Tarkhnarb Orcs of Goblin Gate. Most of this conflict takes place to the east and south of the town of Bree, but rare raids or solitary agents of the Red Eye have made it to as far west as the Dwarven homes in the Blue Mountains.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f30.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":136791,"name":"Hoshi Ori Yume Mirai: Converted Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co60s2.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"PROTOTYPE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"tone work's","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":136792,"name":"Shiawase Shou no Kanrinin-san","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Somewhere in Japan lies the suburban Hanasaki City.

Haru applied for the job on the spot, leaving her hometown to work in their mansion in Tokyo. She thought working as a maid would be fun.. until she meets the six Miyanomori brothers.\n\nThe brothers each have different mothers, all divorced from their father — the head of the family, Miyanomori Genichirou. Being born in a big family, most of the brothers treat Haru like crap. They call her trash and view her as a lowly servant who doesn’t have any right to talk back to them. Not to mention Tae, her new tsundere friend there, keeps lying and gets her in trouble. Haru quickly realized that her new job isn’t by any means easy, but she needs to work hard for her family.\n\nNot too long after Haru starts working there, Genichirou announced to his sons that he’s retiring soon and he’s making a game to determine who will be the next head. The brothers have to entertain him and collect points. The first one who reached ten points will be the new head, and they have until March to please their father. This is the reason why the brothers all have different mothers: Genichirou wants to put them into a battle for the position.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co60rg.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Idea Factory","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Vingt et un Systems","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":136798,"name":"eBaseball Pawafuru Puroyakyu 2020","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Nintendo Switch is equipped with “Power Fes” “LIVE Scenario,” and “Crown Nine” modes for the first time.
