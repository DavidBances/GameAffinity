Remember when looking at your friends’ screen in Goldeneye was frowned upon? Well those days are gone and in Screencheat, we encourage it! Screencheat is a chaotic split-screen multiplayer shooter that forces players to rethink the way they approach conventional multiplayer games. In the Screencheat arena, fast reaction times aren’t enough to keep you alive. When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent’s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks. Screencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre.

It combines Greek Mythology with Sci-Fi in a twisted way! You control Zeus (Boss of Olympus) which is a wacky character. He tries to fix a time machine to save the planet from explosion. Everything happens in Greek mythology timeframe. The characters and dialogues are silly and translated into 6 languages. There is English Voice over in some cut scenes. We use Vector art, a unique cartoonish style. Zeus, the boss of Olympus is summoned back to earth by an ancient security mechanism. The story starts with Zeus flying his spaceship and landing it in the bottom of the Santorini Ocean. In Santorini he will interact with dozens of crazy characters and solve many smart puzzles. The game is big, full length. He will visit Oia, Akrotiri, Fira, Caldera, Volcano and many more places until he finally discovers his super weapon, the thunder and the time machine box. But even then the task is far from over, he will have to set sail to another cluster of Greek islands, Milos, Karpathos, Mykonos and Delos. There he has to find the scattered pieces of the time machine so that he can use it to save the planet. There he will even abduct Europe transformed into a bull (mythology) and take her to Minoan Crete in the Knossos timeframe. There he will enter the famous labyrinth of Knossos, go to Festos and find the missing pieces to complete the mission.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5ail.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Crazysoft Limited","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":144236,"name":"Pet Cats, Save the World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A simple text-based simulator in which you pet cats and, as a result, make the world a better place. \n \nThree endings \nMore than 100 randomly generated cats and effects \nSparkles!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ud8.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kris Ligman","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":118715,"name":"Crowd City","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Control the biggest crowd of the city!\nGather a maximum of people, invade the streets and crush your opponents!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1leu.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Voodoo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"QubicGames S.A.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":118569,"name":"ACA Neo Geo: King of the Monsters 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"King of the Monsters 2 is an action game released by SNK in 1992.
