In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four groups (melds) and a pair (head). There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, stolen from another player and thus melded, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and honours (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds, and the order of dealing and play. However there are many regional variations in the rules; in addition, the scoring system and the minimum hand necessary to win varies significantly based on the local rules being used.

You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective.\n\nThe characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).\n\nThere are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved.

In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.\n\nGameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \"LOW\" setting and a \"HI\" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on \"skill level 1\" while novices get some extra challenge on \"skill level 2\" and experts get the ultimate challenge on \"skill level 3. A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.\n\nSeveral Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally.

The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\n\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ad8.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":83716,"name":"1984: A Game of Government Management","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"84: A Game of Government Management is a financial management game which gives you the chance to be the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the United Kingdom in the 1980s.

Once you are happy with your new car it's time to go to the Paint Shop and select a colour before driving out of the showroom and driving it through town.\n\nYou view your car from the side at a slight elevated angle and you can drive it to the right or left along the road. To change direction you have to pull into a opening and reverse out in the new direction. The town itself is split into two parts and they are connected by an Expressway where you watch a small animated piece of your car driving along the road. Each part of town is made up of various buildings and some buildings can be drove into to either keep your car running smoothly or participate in various mini games. The buildings you encounter are:\n\nCar Wash: You just watch your car going through the various stages of a car wash.\n\nGas Station: You control the mechanic and you can fill the car up with gas and check the tyre pressures.\n\nTuning: Here you watch your car having the engine tuned.\n\nOil Change: You control another mechanic and once you raised the car you must move a drum below the car and try to catch all the drops of oil dripping from the car without making a mess. Once the engine is empty you can fill the car with oil.\n\nDemolition Derby: You view a square track from above with the whole track on screen as you drive around the track. You attempt to smash the other cars to destroy them while avoiding being smashed yourself.\n\nFirefighting. Pulling into the fire station allows you to drive a fire engine along the road looking for any buildings on fire. Once you find a burning building you must park beside a fire hydrant. When you are in the correct position a hose appears. You move the hose around and attempt to put out the fire.

Any pirate who stands in the way of a barrel or other object will be hurled off the screen.

Every floor of the ship has a set number of pirates to be destroyed, as well as a single \"Bow\", a special pirate that regenerates each time it is defeated. Every fourth level in the game yields a bonus level in which the barrels are worth an increased number of points, and a group of enemies entirely made up of Bows (which do not regenerate in this case). With each successive floor, the speed and intelligence of the pirates increases. For every sixteen barrels Momotaro destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them. Momotaro's enemies do not have attacks, but a single touch from an enemy will cause him to die and be revived, costing the player one of his/her extra lives; the game will be over when he or she has no more lives.

In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.\n\nThe penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.\n\nAs in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co38z4.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":145238,"name":"Boxing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Boxing is a Micro VS.

The basic goal of each level is to get to the end, but the way you get there is anything but a straight line. Your plane (which can go in any direction, pulling off loop-de-loops and such at will) has a constantly depleting fuel gauge, forcing you to do one of two things: you can shoot down other planes to refill some fuel, or you can jump out of your plane and try to hijack one from an enemy. You only have a couple of parachutes, though, so you have to be careful - if you miss your shot and don't have any left, you'll go splat. If you do have a parachute (which you can earn more of by shooting down a certain number of enemies from the same wave) you'll glide down and have to face various hazards on the road while you search for a new plane. It's refreshing how open-ended the game is laid out. Although your destination lies all the way to the right of the stage, you have free reign to go wherever you please. If you stay close to the ground you'll avoid enemies, but that also means that you'll be out of luck when you run out of fuel (which happens quickly, especially if you're using turbo). Or, you could go high and get into some seriously intense dog-fights, or even backtrack if you missed a wave of cool looking planes you want to hijack. Other decisions you have to make are based around the fuel gauge, which decreases extremely quickly. Do you focus on shooting other planes, or go the more risky route by trying to hijack? The former is usually the safe bet, but it's incredibly fun to try out all the new planes being thrown your way. You have to be careful, though, as hijacking different enemies produces different effects. While other planes are typically a safe bet, other enemies are sometimes not. For example, trying to hijack the flying pigs results in you either wasting a parachute or falling to your death, and UFO's zap you if you try to get on them. Though there isn't as much variety in the levels as I would like, there are constantly new enemies thrown at you, which are really the star of the show anyway. Through and through the action stays frantic and intense, with some opportunities for some really memorable moments. It's a perfect example of the easy to pick up, hard to master philosophy of game design. Newcomers can have a blast even when they're dying every twenty seconds, and it's an absolute blast trying to perfect your game. While I'm not usually into self-imposed challenges, it's super fun trying to finish a level without dying and keeping the same plane. Graphically, the game is astounding for 1984, and still serves the game nicely today. The colors are very bright and vivid, the cartoony art style is great, and everything moves at a brisk pace. The audio design don't fare as well, though - get ready for a lot of bleeps and bloops. One other thing to note is that, unlike so many games of the era, you don't have to start over at the beginning when you die. Instead, you start right back from where you left off. I can't express how delighted I was to find that out, because although it might be \"hardcore\", it simply sucks having to replay the beginning over and over again in other games. It might be a bit obscure, and it's not perfect, but as far as I'm concerned Acrobatic Dog-Fight is a classic and an absolute must-play.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vqj8gvrq46h1cd5efrr2.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39617,"name":"The Battle Road","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Battle-Road is a vertical scrolling shooter racing arcade game released by Irem in 1984.\nThe game was an early open-ended vehicle combat game that featured branching paths and up to 32 possible routes.
