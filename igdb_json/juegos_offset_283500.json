Players have the ability to hire new recruits, buy potions and distribute artifacts obtained in battles between fights. Each unit can be outfitted with one artifact and two potions. In addition to common units the player's army can include up to three unique heroes.\n\nAlmost every environment object is interactive – one can chop down a tree, set it on fire, or even turn it into an ally using magic. Each unit has its own action points which can be spent for any action – movements, attacks, spells or active skills. The player can randomly move units during his turn.\n\nThe in-game campaign editor lets you create custom campaigns, as a series of linked battles, with story text and customized rewards. You can save these campaigns a single file in order to easily share them.\n\nWith each unit the player has to make important tactical and strategic decisions. There is no need to remember a great number of each units properties or make complicated calculations – the player should rely on their personal assessment of the current situation.
