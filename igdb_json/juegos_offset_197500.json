It was released by the biblical video game producer Wisdom Tree in 1994, and was the only commercially released SNES game in the U.S. that was not officially sanctioned by Nintendo. In order to bypass the Super Nintendo's lockout chip, Wisdom Tree devised a pass-through system similar to the Game Genie, where the player had to insert an officially licensed SNES game into the cartridge slot on top of the Super 3D Noah's Ark cartridge. Despite its name, it is unrelated to Konami's official Noah's Ark game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In January 2014, the game was re-released for the SNES, initially available only by private email orders, but later through Piko Interactive's website. The game was also updated for the 20th Anniversary Edition and released at itch.io on May 26, 2014 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\nThe game plays similarly to Wolfenstein 3D, but the graphics were changed to reflect a non-violent theme. Instead of killing Nazi soldiers in a castle, the player takes the part of Noah, wandering the Ark, using a slingshot to shoot sleep-inducing food at angry attacking animals, mostly goats, in order to render them unconscious. The animals behave differently: goats, the most common enemy, will only kick Noah, while the other animals such as sheep, ostriches, antelopes and oxen will shoot spittle at him from a distance. Goats are also unable to open doors, which the other animals can do.\nThe gameplay is aimed at younger children. Noah's Ark includes secret passages, food, weapons and extra lives. There are secret levels, and shortcut levels as well. The player eventually comes across larger and more powerful slingshots, and flings coconuts and watermelon at the larger boss-like animals, such as Ernie the Elephant and Carl the Camel.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co258d.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":11087,"name":"Alien Breed: Tower Assault","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the depths of space a holocaust has occured.

There's the platforming aspect of the game where you must guide Quinn over pits and through obstacles by running, jumping, climbing, and even hiding. There's also the fighting aspect of the game where Quinn has to fight enemies to progress by using an assortment of high, medium, or low punches or kicks. Quinn doesn't enter Fight Mode automatically, so if you want him to fight, you need to put him into Fight Mode. Unlike Prince of Persia, however, there are four difficulties to choose from which make the game easier or harder overall.\n\nThe game ushers you along by issuing way points directly under your Compass, showing you exactly where you need to be heading to progress the story. This could be anywhere from a local tavern to a magical tower on an entirely different tier of the city. Due to this linearity, it's almost impossible to become lost in the game or otherwise stuck. This game also has no inventory system, but there are chests scattered around the world which contain useful items such as Medical Herbs or quest-related items such as the Crazy Guy's Rat which progress the story or can be traded for other items such as new weaponry.\n\nAs stated, there are four difficulties. In addition to Easy, Normal, and Hard, a fourth difficulty–\"Very Easy\"–exists which allows you to cheat your way through the game by giving you infinite hit points or even making you complete immune to being hit. There doesn't seem to be any drawbacks to this mode aside from the possibility of getting stuck in certain traps which would otherwise kill you immediately.\n\nLastly, every now and then you'll be treated to an in-game animated cut scene which furthers the story of Quinn. These cut scenes are fully voiced (using tracks from the CD-ROM) and animated, the art style differing slightly from either the cover art or the in game sprites. (The art style is slightly reminiscent of certain Philips CD-i titles' cut scenes.)","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wuckcnxrma93c3oyyf6x.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2509,"name":"Heimdall 2: Into the Hall of Worlds","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Isometric adventure platform game.

The studio is known for developing games that include exceptionally well crafted puzzles and a wacky sense of humor which frequently breaks the fourth wall and plays to a wide assortment of offbeat puns. Moreover, the company has emerged with a winning streak of fantasy and sci-fi games based on popular literature adaptations. The most famous of these are Frederick Pohl's Gateway and Terry Brooks' Shannara.\n\nIn 1994, Legend Entertainment has chosen to adapt not 1 book but the whole series of 7 books by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman known as The Death Gate Cycle. The original release of the game even includes a special gift for fans of the book series, namely an exclusive short story written by the same authors that tells some of the history of the mysterious Assassin's Guild from the series.\n\nIn Death Gate, the player is cast in the role of a freshly freed Patryn—a young, brave wizard named Haplo. By his deeds in the Labyrinth, he has gained Xar's trust to be sent as a scout to the other 4 realms. The way between them leads through a mystical portal known as the Death Gate. For his journey, Haplo is handed not a single but several quests to complete. He must first explore the realms, learn about the new lands, and find the pieces of the World Seal that will allow the reformation of the world to its original whole. He must also retrieve as much of forgotten magical lore as he can, and find runes that will allow him to enter all the other realms. Finally, and most importantly, he must find out what has happened to the Sartan who seem to have vanished somewhere long ago, so that Xar will be able to bring them to the proper Patryn justice.\n\nThe game, by taking inspiration from the first 4 books, creates a certain unique experience for the player that stands out among other fantasy adventures. There is an unusually layered structure based on the initial premise of the 5 separate realms, since the consequences of the sundering run much deeper than mere differences in landscapes. From realm to realm life conditions vary enormously, including geography, history, fauna, flora and astronomical bodies. For each realm, the population is divided into very specific societies, although many attributes of each race remain common. Several royal families, powerful guilds, and wealthy, independent merchants all have their own specific goals and ambitions that are not at all connected to the grand schemes of the Patryn and the Sartan, which they mostly are unaware of at this time after centuries of their absence. The distinctiveness of each culture's circumstances and the individual diversity of the larger and smaller schemers within the cast of characters give a special magic and wonder to the proceedings in the game, especially when the player visits a new realm for the first time and starts exploring it. The worlds possess a mysterious, intriguing flavor, but with a touch of whimsical surprises from nearly everywhere. Each encounter with Xar between travels reveals more information concerning the whole mechanics that connect these realms.\n\nDeath Gate contains some exceptionally good voice acting. This is especially true for Henry Strozier who plays the role of Xar. He carries a low, charismatic, and authoritative voice that perfectly befits a character with a brave heart, long experience, deep wisdom, but a good share of arrogance. He shines for good measure too, since the player will spend more time conversing with his character than any other in the game. Haplo, who is only heard in conversations, voiced by David DeBoy, does not have a plain, uninteresting voice either. He sounds slightly arrogant and lordly like his master, but also rather youthful, yet manly enough to give an air of independency.\n\nThe MIDI music in Death Gate is very well done. The compositions are perfect for an epic fantasy setting. The tunes are often light and comforting, but they can change dramatically to a more majestic tone when visiting the king's palace and to a darker motif when exploring the undergrounds of Abarrach, the vicious Labyrinth, or the deadly Assassin's Guild.\n\nAside from Haplo and Xar, several other characters from the books also make an appearance in the game. Many of them, however, have been greatly simplified and reduced to only episodic roles with little development. Many major characters from the books are missing altogether, most notably Alfred, whose role is crucial in bringing out Haplo's characterization in the literary originals. On the other hand, some of the memorable archetypes from the books are used in new, interesting ways. For example, a boy named Bane has been recast into a different child with a different life and social standing, though both share a very similar personality. The character that stays most true to the canon is the whimsical, crazy wizard Zifnab, who appears in all his pun infested glory. In general, the plotlines are less violent and happier than those in the books, and the characters show less moral ambiguity.\n\nDeath Gate plays like a traditional point-and-click adventure game, but like a role-playing game it is as much about being free to explore the fictional world as about following a foreordained storyline thread. There is quite a bit of narrative text, diaries, historical documents, and dialogs to sieve through. They are all well written and are rather fascinating, since everything is directly connected to the quests the player needs to complete or the puzzles the player needs to solve. There is a fine dose of humor in the game too, but nothing so unsubtle that may distract from taking the main conflicts of the story seriously. From this stance, Death Gate is actually quite a departure from the largely comical gallery of previous game titles from Legend Entertainment.\n\nThe puzzles in Death Gate are a bit on the easy side, but the enjoyment they give is very well balanced by their ingenuity. The wealth of subplots, quests, plot twists, and deceptions add a lot of tension to the player's own proceedings. There is a certain logic and buttons based puzzle that is rather hard to beat. However, the player can ask for help from the game to solve it (or even skip over it). In general, the difficulty level of the game lies somewhere between easy and medium. The player can die in the game, but there is an option available to undo the player's last fatal action.\n\nComparison with the books quickly reveals some of the obvious budgetary or time constraints the developer must have faced during Death Gate's development. Pryan, the realm of fire, is build of elements taken not only of this realm in its original form but also of Chelestra, the realm of water. Consequently, the latter realm has shrunken to a very limited scope in the game. The smallness of Chelestra comes in the game as a particular disappointing revelation, since it is the last of the elemental realms that the player visits.\n\nThe interface used in Death Gate has evolved from the original Legend Entertainment's interactive fiction interface. There is an always available standard list of commands (such as Take, Look at, or Use) for the player to choose from, reminiscent of Lucasarts' SCUMM interface. In addition, extra action commands specific to an object appear when it is clicked. For example, when clicking on a door, apart from the standard list of verbs, there are added options to unlock, knock, or eavesdrop on the door. There are many actions which are not necessary to complete the game but which trigger funny responses specific to the situation. Altogether, the interface is a clever compromise between the sense of freedom achieved through a text parser and the simplicity of contemporary point-and-click style.\n\nGameplay in Death Gate draws on a few gimmicks that are typical of role-playing games. For some parts of the game, the player is able to have a party of several characters. There is also a process of collecting magical spells, even though they have been tweaked for solving puzzles instead of combat. A spell is constructed by connecting runes in a combination. After that, it is traced in the air by Haplo with his hands to bring the spell into motion. The player will be able to learn many spells in the game, mostly from the mensch. This is an important diversion from the canon, as the mensch from the books possess a different kind of magic altogether.\n\nThe high resolution graphics of the game will remind fans strongly of fantasy literature illustrated covers. The characters are beautifully detailed in high resolution, but rarely fully animated. However, their faces are always incredibly alive, especially in conversational close-ups. When exploring the game world, the player will notice many intricate but small animations in otherwise generally static sceneries. Major events occurring in the game are partially described in narrative text and partially presented as cut scenes. Sadly, the number of background illustrations in the game is a bit limited. All locations are shown from only a single point of view. Sometimes, the player is drawn to something interesting drawn at the edge of an illustration but is unable to look closely to find out more about it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co29tk.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2465,"name":"Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unleash your imagination into a vast, savage world, sun-scorched and wind-scraped.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3izp.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2422,"name":"Alien Logic","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the 21st century, human beings have all but destroyed their home planet Earth.

The Shantha, one of the most ancient and powerful races on Jorune, adepts at the magical art of Isho, were not satisfied with the shape the planet has taken. 3500 years later, one of them, known as the Red Shantha, began attacking human settlements. The hero of the game is one of the villagers who have survived Red Shantha's attack. Having found the way to master Isho, the hero must rescue his friends and explore the planet, searching for the source of evil. \n \nAlien Logic is based on the Skyrealms of Jorune role-playing system. The player takes control of one character; there is no party in the game. While there is a story to follow, much of the game is open-ended, dedicated to exploring Jorune, searching for items, precious crystals (which increase the hero's parameters), and fighting enemies. The exploration mode uses a side-scrolling perspective; the player can switch to combat mode when an enemy is nearby. Combat takes place on the same screen as exploration, and is action-based. Combat relies heavily on magic (Isho); casting spells deplete the Isho bar. Spell sequences are called dyshas, which can be offensive or defensive. Preparing dysha combinations beforehand and then using them on the enemies (by clicking on them) is an essential combat strategy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nfbdeyklazv033deaqzp.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2418,"name":"Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Al Qadim: The Genie's Curse features a new and improved interface and game engine.

The first Gundam production not set in the continuity established in the 1979 original series of the franchise, G Gundam presents a world in which global conflicts are settled in a yearly tournament fought between Gundam mecha, each representing its nation's qualities (and stereotypes). Naturally, this premise was adapted into a one-on-one fighting game.\n\nThe game includes 10 different Gundams (one of which can only be selected by players via a secret code), each with its own arena and background music. Four different playing modes are on offer:\nStory Battle allows a limited selection of only five Gundams (the members of the Shuffle Alliance in the series), presenting a series of nine matches against all other Gundams in the game. All matches consist of only one round.\nVersus Battle is for two-player matches. Players choose their Gundam, its pilot (different pilots have different attributes regarding performance, defence and speed) and arena. Both players can select the same Gundam (with the exception of the secret character) and pilot. Matches are best-of-three. Handicaps can be set for each player.\nChampionship Battle is similar to Story Battle, but is in best-of-three mode, allows Gundam selection from the full roster and lacks story sequences.\nTeam Battle is a team-based two-player mode. Players select between one to five Gundams per team. One-round matches follow, with the loser being removed from the roster until only one team remains.\nControls involve the four face buttons for weak and strong punches and kicks, and the two shoulder buttons for quick forward or backward dashes. Each Gundam has its own special moves triggered via input combinations, including extra powerful \"desperation attacks\", which can only be activated if the Gundam's life bar has been significantly lowered and flashes red.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8b9f.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":45708,"name":"Kick Off 3: European Challenge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kick Off 3: European Challenge is a football game developed by Steve Screech for Anco Games as a sequel to Kick Off 2 (which made it to the Sega Mega Drive in the altered form of Super Kick Off).

They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.\n\nMore complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons.

Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.\n\nThe most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.\n\nTetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3a6q.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":42425,"name":"Wagyan Paradise","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wagyan Paradise is the third Wagyan Land game for the Super Famicom and the sixth game in the series overall.

It has virtually no story and relies entirely on exploration and strategic combat. Set in a medieval world with little to no distinguishing characteristics, \"Lunatic Dawn\" throws the player immediately into the game world, which is open for him to explore. The player is able to choose the main character's gender, race (human, elf, etc.), class, and even age - older characters are more powerful, but have a more limited play time.\n\nIndeed, the entire gameplay process is timed. Traveling to a remote city or dungeon can take up to several game days. The player has to provide sufficient food for his party during this time. Player party consists of pre-generated characters, who have different names and belong to different races and classes, but have virtually no personality. Food and other supplies can be acquired in towns, through which the player moves in a Wizardry-like fashion - viewing locations from first-person perspective and selecting menu commands.\n\nWhen the party enters a dungeon, the view switches to isometric. The dungeons are large and maze-like, with enemies visible on screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a battle initiates. The battles are turn-based but fast-paced, reminding somewhat the Infinity Engine battles from Baldur's Gate series. The participants can freely move on the battle field. The player directly controls only the main characters, but can assign general commands to the party members.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lk16msjxzvj0vgwxwmor.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-FX"}]},{"id":276102,"name":"Crescent Satsujin Jiken: Tozasareta Nikki","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7cte.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":209009,"name":"The Pagemaster","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":94695,"name":"Air Havoc Controller","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An airport traffic control tower simulation game","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ehs.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":75974,"name":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a one-on-one competitive fighting game, featuring two different game modes: a Scenario Mode where the player competes against a series of CPU-controlled opponents, and a Battle Mode for two players.

Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with.

He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.\n\nFeda: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.\n\nIn the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.\n\nEach party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.\n\nThe map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.\n\nIn some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8nu9.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":42309,"name":"Sotsugyou Bangai-hen: Nee Mahjong Shiyo!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sotsugyou Bangai Hen: Nee Mahjong Shiyo! is a Miscellaneous game, published by KSS, which was released in Japan in 1994.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lxezvnk3ylwrkhdte013.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":38363,"name":"Multi Play Volleyball","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player controls a national volleyball squad (i.e., Cuba, USA, Canada, Brazil) as the play controls the entire team using an overhead view.
