Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level.

Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring \"stroke-shaded\" animation-style graphics, a \"Wild West\" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2.\n\nWild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The \"drifters\" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.\n\nAs the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed \"expressive communication\" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair.\n\nWild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons & a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles.

Musashi uses the two swords, Fusion and Lumina, to fight his enemies. The two swords have different properties: while Fusion behaves more or less like a traditional melee weapon, Lumina needs to be imbued with various elemental items in order to unleash powerful attacks.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3bfv.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Product Development Division 5","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":1811,"name":"Musashi: Samurai Legend","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Musashi Samurai Legend marks the second chapter in the Musashi series.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1xaj.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix Business Division 8","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":1815,"name":"Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Embark on a journey to explore the land, seas and skies of the Dragon Quest universe in this grand entry from the Zenithia Trilogy.

Power points open up new areas and Inquisition points define the influence over the region; each new level provides a perk that benefits the entire Inquisition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mvy.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"BioWare Edmonton","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"BioWare","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":1889,"name":"Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Scattered across five different regions, five special heroes must travel their own dangerous paths to grow in strength, unravel a demonic plot & ultimately save the world from chaos.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3bhl.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Capybara Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tag Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Capybara Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":1890,"name":"Might & Magic: Duel of Champions","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"Duel of Champions is the free-to-play online strategic card game in the universe of Might & Magic.\"\n\nThe iOS version of the game went offline on September 16, 2015.\nThe PC version of the game will be going offline October 31, 2016","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2p77.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Québec","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Blue Byte","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":1891,"name":"Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Play with friends or AI as you travel across fantastic planes to take on new encounters & opponents.

Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use.\n\nHero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories.\n\nThe main character's skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy's picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics.\n\nThe game features a day/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8e8y.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":1894,"name":"Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Trial by Fire is the sequel to Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero. It takes place in the town Shapeir and the desert surrounding it, in a Middle East-like environment. It seems that the powerful elemental spirits have been troubling the Shapeir folk recently. Something, or someone, is behind those troubles. It is the hero's task to find out what is going on, get acquainted with the many inhabitants of Shapeir, and prove once more that he is worthy of his heroic title.\n\nLike its predecessor, Trial by Fire is a hybrid game that incorporates elements from adventure and role-playing genres. It has a text-based interface, puzzles to solve, inventory items, characters to talk to, as well as pure RPG elements such as character growth system and battles. Player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a wizard, and can also become a paladin during the course of the game if he follows a strict moral code.\n\nReal-time combat is presented on separate screens and offers more options than the previous title. There are several types of high, mid-level, and low attacks, as well as parrying and dodging. The hero raises his combat proficiency and other skills by fighting enemies, training, and performing various actions that influence the corresponding parameters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25et.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":1895,"name":"Quest for Glory III: Wages of War","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wages of War is the third game in the Quest for Glory series. It is set in the Africa-like world of Tarna, where the hero travels with paladin Rakeesh, his new Liontaur friend he has met in the previous game. Shortly after his arrival, the hero learns about the conflict between the human Simbani tribe and the seemingly malevolent neighboring Leopardmen. It is now time for our hero to become a skillful diplomat and prevent an upcoming war between the two nations.\n\nThe basic gameplay system is similar to that of the two preceding games. The game has an adventure-like structure and gameplay elements, including puzzles to solve, inventory items to use, and characters to talk to, as well as a role-playing system with combat and character development. As in the predecessors, the player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a mage; in this installment, the paladin class is selectable from the beginning of the game (unlike the previous game, where the hero could only earn the title of a paladin during the course of the story). Saved characters from the previous game can be imported.\n\nLike in the earlier Quest for Glory games, the main character's parameters increase directly after battles or by repeatedly performing various actions. New to the series is an overworld map on which the hero travels between locations. Hostile encounters may occur randomly while traversing the map. Combat system is similar to the predecessors, with real-time battles where the player selects various offensive and defensive options.\n\nGraphics engine and interface in this installment are the same as in the remake of the first game: it has 256-color graphics and an icon-based interface which was used by Sierra for their contemporary adventure games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21g3.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":1896,"name":"Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shadows of Darkness is the fourth Quest for Glory game. It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.\n\nLike the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle).\n\nCombat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25ev.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":1897,"name":"Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"After having survived the dangers he encountered on his previous journey, the hero travels with the wizard Erasmus to a Greece-like country called Silmaria.

The hero enters the contest, aided by Erasmus, Rakeesh, and other old friends. However, as the competition progresses, contestants are being systematically killed by an unknown assassin. All the victims are murdered near the Dragon Pillars, which keep the Dragon of Silmaria in captivity. The hero must investigate the crimes and save Silmaria from a grave danger.\n\nDragon Fire is the final game in the Quest for Glory series. Like the previous games in the series, Dragon Fire is a hybrid between puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing game. The player talks to the world's inhabitants, gathering clues and items necessary to acquire in order to complete the quests and advance the story. Unlike all its predecessors, Dragon Fire has no separate battle screens; the action-based battles take place on the exploration screen, utilizing a simple point-and-click interface, similarly to Diablo. The game has heavier weapon and armor management than other Quest for Glory games, strengthening the RPG angle.\n\nMany quests are optional or can be completed in different ways. The hero can also marry one of the several major female characters in the game, provided the player does the right thing to impress the girl.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21fr.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Yosemite Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":1898,"name":"0x10c","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space travel was gaining popularity amongst corporations and rich individuals.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/v0u1zdymhws2qbkefrg4.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mojang Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1899,"name":"Age of Wushu","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"MMORPG from Snail Game currently in closed beta.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2sj3.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gala Networks","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Snail Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Suzhou Snail Electronic","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mental Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1900,"name":"Akaneiro: Demon Hunters","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hints of Little Red Riding Hood combine with Japanese folklore and illustrated in Spicy Horse's unique dark fantasy style, \"Akaneiro: Demon Hunters\" is an action-roleplaying game (ARPG) that lets players hunt mythical monsters in Edo-era Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4nww.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Spicy Horse Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1901,"name":"Command & Conquer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Command & Conquer (previously known as Command & Conquer: Generals 2) is a cancelled real-time strategy video game in the Command & Conquer series.

As in the Earthsea series, each spell is represented by some nonsense \"magic word\" which is treated as a verb by the game's text parser, so that one can use the FROTZ spell (which causes objects to glow and give off light) by typing >FROTZ BOOK, in exactly the same way as one might type >PICK UP BOOK or >READ BOOK.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5b80.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Infocom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad PCW"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"TRS-80"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"TRS-80 Color Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"}]},{"id":1948,"name":"Sorcerer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards.

There was a time of legends and heroes, of incredible accomplishments and great deeds, a time when the world knew true grandeur. That time is long gone, however, crushed under the heel of fate and decay. The Elves are gone, now, victims to their own delusions. They failed to heed the warnings of the Harbinger, the one who came to warn them...\n\nHe arrived on the night the moons and the Centaur constellation were aligned, several millenia ago, his appearance foul and nightmarish, and warned all who would listen of the impending doom that lay ahead. He issued warnings and prophecies, but the Elves had grown vain and arrogant, and heeded him not. The Harbinger left, promising to return when the time would be right again.\n\nSeveral generations later-a short time by Elven reckoning-the Harbinger returned, once more treading under an alignment of the moons and constellations. The Elves had all but forgotten his past warnings. As the Curse fell upon their race, they stood defenseless. Despite their arcane lore and magical skills, they could not resist the godly powers that crushed them. When the Harbinger left their lands, there was not a single building standing. It is said that the winds carried the stench of death even as far as the Dwarven villages in the north. The latter took this for a sign that evil was coming, and prepared to defend themselves. When the Harbinger came to their lands to warn them too that their turn would come, that great danger lay ahead, they grew fearful of the visitor's appearance, and shunned him. He left them, warning them that achievements alone were not the measure of a worthy people.\n\nA millenia later, the skies repeated their fateful alignment of moons and stars. The Dwarves had flourished into a society of craftsmen and artisans. They had built great cities and were dutifully worshiping their god. Prophecies from long ago warned them against a fate similar to that of the Elves, so they had taken care to properly groom themselves and prepare for the Third Coming. When the Harbinger came to\nthem, however, they could not stand the sight and smell of him, and, mistaking him for some fiend from hell, immediately struck him down. This, historians say, was the very act that caused the downfall of the Dwarves. They also say that some humans witnessed the event, and that the Harbinger warned them as well, that he told them they too would be judged, lest their worthiness was greater than that of the Elves and the Dwarves.\n\nNow, it may be that none of this tale is true, that we are but a worried people living under an unusual alignment of stars, one which has not occurred in a thousand years, but maybe, just maybe, there is some truth to this tale. Maybe there really is a Harbinger that is walking the land even as we speak, walking towards us to judge us and torment us if we fail him. So, little scoundrel, before I kill you for your crimes, before I condemn your soul to everlasting fire, answer me this one question.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ffj.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Vircom Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1987,"name":"XIII","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"XIII is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on the popular Belgian cult comic created by Jean Van Hamme and illustrated by William Vance.
