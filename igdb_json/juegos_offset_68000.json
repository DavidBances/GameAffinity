Unlike other games of the interactive movie genre, which generally display the movie bits using pre-rendered full motion video, this game renders 3D models of the movie in real time.\n\nThe science fiction story of this movie/game follows a group of employees of the interplanetary mining corporation Miller-Western. For a variety of disciplinary reasons, the employees are sent to the Jupiter moon of Ganymede which used to have a thriving osmium-mining operation but is now just a dumping ground for problematic employees who assault their bosses or engineer faulty equipment because they were drunk. No one on the base is to be trusted, everyone is hiding a bevy of secrets and to make matters worse, every monitor across the moon base periodically picks up mysterious transmissions that appear to depict some unknown alien lifeform.

One of these weapons, according to legend, could obliterate major cities, wiping them off the face of the earth. The player takes the part of Colonel Grom, a member of the Polish army fighting the Nazis during World War II. Grom is a seasoned and shrewd commander who has his own personal score to settle with the Germans.\n\nGROM: Terror in Tibet is a predominantly role-playing game with elements of stealth and emphasis on tactical combat. The player controls a party of characters, navigating them through towns and other locations in a fairly linear fashion, often engaging in conversations with multiple dialogue choices. Travelling between the various locations is handled by way of a country map. Combat system has similarities to that of Baldur's Gate, with real-time management and the ability to pause in order to issue commands. Unlike in most RPGs, the characters themselves do not level up in this game; their only growing attribute is weapon proficiency, which plays an important role in combat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ov3.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":73769,"name":"Warring Worms","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/r3iix0scvy6odi3wb1ig.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":73770,"name":"Conquest of Japan","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Conquest of Japan is a strategy game developed by Impression Games.

As the game opens, the Master of Mischief, the common antagonist to the Super Seekers games, uses a weather machine to freeze the mountain in snow and ice and scatters the castle's treasures all over the mountain. The player takes on the role of the Super Seeker, whose job is to find the scattered treasures and return them to the castle's treasure chest in order to thaw out the mountain.\n\nThe mountain itself consists of three levels. The player cannot climb higher until he has gathered the supplies, like ice axes, ladders, or catapult parts, useful for scaling the mountain. To obtain these items, the players must help out the local inhabitants complete math-related tasks such as adjusting clocks to a given time, balancing scales, and counting crystals.\n\nIn order to find treasures, the player must place a specific amount of snowballs at a certain location. To find out how many snowballs are needed, the player must catch an elf carrying a scroll. If he answers the riddle correctly, he will be told how to find treasures on that particular level.\n\nOnce the player reaches the top of the castle on the highest level of the mountain, he deposits all treasures found into the castle's treasure chest and is given a prize as a reward for completing the three stages. This prize is kept on display in the player's clubhouse, showing how many times he has ascended the mountain. These prizes are usually children's toys, such as flutes or toy trains. From this point, the player may exit the clubhouse and start again from the bottom of the mountain. At higher ranks, the game becomes more difficult, as there will be more treasures to find, harder riddles to answer, and snowbullies that steal money.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co50dw.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"The Learning Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":73997,"name":"Fantasy Manager: The Computer Game","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":73998,"name":"Everyone's A Wally: A Day in the Life of Wally","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Everyone's a Wally is a game by Mikro-Gen where the main objective is to get into the bank and withdraw money via solving a series of linked puzzles and collect the letters B-R-E-A-K","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/r5wfkmsp0bgafj78p7wu.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":73999,"name":"Twisty Tracks","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ds3pvyf2ac0nkjmgyikk.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74000,"name":"Cybergenic Ranger: Secret of the 7th Planet","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74002,"name":"Raven: Chapter 1 - The Commands of Eurybia","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74003,"name":"Zeddas: Servant of Sheol","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You walk the haunted halls of Rodvydel Castle and try to break the curse upon it by Zeddas, the King Of Demons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6b6j.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Caravan Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":74004,"name":"Grand Slam Bridge II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":74005,"name":"Blue's Room: Blue Talks!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zkl7chz1oq7g3awu7mih.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74006,"name":"The Quest of Agravain","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jktgc9vs03kocaivoohq.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74007,"name":"UMS II: Nations at War","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Muvh like the original UMS, this sequel boasts better graphics and has different scenarios such as Waterloo, Invasion of Normandy etc.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hj3d5h7rl3rdj3aartks.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74008,"name":"Remote Assault","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74009,"name":"Toxic Mayhem: The Troma Project","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A turn-based game that features locations and characters from the Troma movie catalog.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bw6si8rjxm3nlnoqcudz.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74010,"name":"Snowy: Treasure Hunter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The first in the Snowy: Treasure Hunter platform puzzler series of games has the titular bear travel to three worlds with distinct graphic themes; an Egyptian world, a Greek mythological world and the final Norse inspired world.

When cruising the planet's surface, your ship's alarm will sound if it detects enemy movement. This is followed by the drones chasing you and shooting you with their lasers. While fighting the drones, you can use the keyboard's function keys to either fire torpedoes or phasors.\n\nAlso while transporting scientists, you must supply them with rations in order for them to survive. You are constantly running out of fuel, meaning that you need to stock up while orbiting space. Higher ranks have you rescuing more scientists and navigating an asteroid field. You have a specific number of star days to rescue the scientists. If you run out of time or fuel, the game will be over. The higher the rank, the more difficult your rescue mission becomes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gfd.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ISA Software, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":74048,"name":"Heart of the Dragon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Heart of the Dragon is a side scrolling beat 'em up for the Amiga.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/degppdhyatc8oventdni.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74049,"name":"Master of Monsters","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5nty.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Renovation Products","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SystemSoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Micro Cabin","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Toshiba-EMI","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":74050,"name":"Minebot Arena","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74051,"name":"Su-27 Flanker Mission Disk","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74052,"name":"The Rescue of Lorri in Lorrinitron","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A 2D, top-down role-playing game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/t7q1gnqpwu2vij86d0ky.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74053,"name":"Moraff's World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Moraff's World is a dungeon crawling game featuring several character races and classes to choose from.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zw7iok576ra2rrcv32jo.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":74054,"name":"Soul of a Robot","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":74055,"name":"Saishuu Heiki Kanojo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A multi-story, multi-ending love adventure game based on Shin Takahashi's original manga.
