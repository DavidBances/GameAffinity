The five locations in the adventure include St. Petersburg, a palace, a train, a ship and Paris. In each place, Pooka has a specific task that will help Anya reach her goal, ranging from contacts with Dmitri to creating passports and helping a Prima Ballerina find her lucky ballet slippers. Throughout the journey, you must also avoid Rasputin's minions who will zap Pooka into the underworld and make him play deadly games to escape. While underground, Pooka is challenged to several games including Doggy Dodge (dodge rocks), Minion Mosh (a jumping game similar to Fox and Geese), Skull Toss (bowling-like game using Rasputin's denizens as targets) and Hidden Maze. In the latter, you see a maze for a short time and then try and guide Pooka safely through to the other side. Between locations, you hear entries from Anya's diary and after the game is completed, you're rewarded with screenshots from the movie.

Though their numbers and armaments small, the beleaguered lunar colonists had finally reached their breaking point, and declared themselves independent of the Earth.\n\nThe United Nations, who had assumed total power over the lunar colonies, was furious and desperate at the development. The lunar colonies were absolutely necessary to feeding of the citizens of Earth, and due to this the United Nations could not possibly stand to accept anything but total victory over the Lunar Defense Force. However the LDF does not plan to lose: To them, they are fighting for their homeland and plan to defend it at all costs. That is where you come in...\n\nThe game features many different styles of mission goals: objectives ranging from sabotage (where the player must find and destroy enemy infrastructure), seek-and-destroy (where the player and other LDF soldiers must eliminate an enemy stronghold), and even defense missions (where the player and an allotment of LDF soldiers must successfully defend a Rebel objective). Depending on the type of mission, the player will be allotted a specific number of LDF soldiers in reserve to back up the player's main force. Managing the numbers of those reserve soldiers could spell victory or disaster in some missions. The player has a large arsenal of futuristic weapons at his/her disposal, ranging from laser pistols to chain-fed rail-guns and plasma rifles.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4qz1.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Fenris Wolf","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Creative Labs","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":69660,"name":"Loco-Commotion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tlgsugtldsmaasks30dh.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69661,"name":"Im Namen des Gesetzes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/emnewxu6cdqm4jdztrzp.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69662,"name":"Electronic Popple","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A beat 'em up that features anthropomorphic computer components.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lgt5pfnrux660szqbua1.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69663,"name":"NY Warriors","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A multi-directional top-down shooter in which the player has to save New York City from a terroristic nuclear assault.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tyyvvwo9ceiwln1seqnb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69664,"name":"Inca","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An action adventure that combines history, metaphysics, science fiction, and other strangeness into a strange hybrid.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5vdf.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Philips Interactive Media","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Coktel Vision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Philips CD-i"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":69665,"name":"Lady Safari","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An action game in which the player is tasked with selecting a scantily clad woman and guiding them across an African landscape avoiding hazards, dodging enemies, and taking pictures of the local wildlife.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ma7zxup6sghevwlyhsdd.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69666,"name":"Executive Suite","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Armonk Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":69667,"name":"Lanfeust de Troy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Lanfeust de Troy (Lanfeust of Troy) is a DS/PSP game based on the popular French comic series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2of8.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":69668,"name":"The Broken Land","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nc5d5n630lxskvkbhpik.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Arc Media","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arc Platinous Family","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":69669,"name":"Dr. Ruth's Computer Game of Good Sex","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A mostly textual computer quiz game about sex.
