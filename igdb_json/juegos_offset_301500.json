Released in 2000 for the PlayStation, it is a sequel to the original MediEvil and continues the story of Sir Daniel Fortesque.\n\nSet in Victorian-era London, the game follows Sir Dan as he is resurrected once again to stop a sorcerer named Lord Palethorn, who has unleashed chaos by reanimating the dead using pages from Zarok's spellbook. The gameplay combines hack-and-slash combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving, with new weapons, levels, and enemies. The game introduces unique features such as a ghostly ally, Kiya, and new mechanics like controlling Dan’s detached head for specific puzzles.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9b90.jpg","releaseYear":2025,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"}]},{"id":329196,"name":"Bottop","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9b6v.jpg","releaseYear":2025,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Xitilon","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":329197,"name":"Merge Numbers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9b6w.jpg","releaseYear":2025,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nostra Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":329198,"name":"Red Solstice 2: Survivors - Ultimate Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Plan your strategy and undertake real-time combat missions, in this sequel to the best-selling tactical game, Red Solstice!\n\nThe Red Solstice 2: Survivors Ultimate Edition contains the base game, as well as all previously released DLCs, including new story lines, classes, maps and much more!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9b6x.jpg","releaseYear":2025,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ironward","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"505 Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"}]},{"id":329199,"name":"The Reward of Cherishment and Eternity.","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Death, nature's remedy for all things, offers you a deal: Help him, and he shall grant peace for a lost loved one.\n\n-Explore a visually stunning world filled with hidden secrets and unravel its mysteries at your own pace.\n-Chart your own path by playing the levels in any order, enhancing replayability.\n-Master a deep and complex combat system, with fully integrated DualSense wireless controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for unparalleled tactile engagement.\n\nThe Reward of Cherishment and Eternity is a third-person, action-adventure shooter that combines exploration, emotionally charged storytelling, and intense, rewarding combat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9bgz.jpg","releaseYear":2025,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Fears Ahead Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"}]},{"id":329200,"name":"Mandragora Seeker in the Creep Zone","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A timid gravedigger’s strange adventure to claim the Mandragora Gold Prize!
