They eventually began allowing people to use custom music, but this is not factored into their score. Once they finished designing their level, they would submit an IPS file, it would get judged + ranked, and that would be the end of it. This year, however, S.N.N. decided to assign resources (secondary exits, Map16 slots, etc) to users with the intention of putting all of their levels into a ROM and essentially creating a full hack out of it. The hack features 82 submitted entries and 4 switch palaces, which makes a grand total of 86 levels for you to beat. All of the levels are open from the start - you can play them in any order you’d like. To help you keep track of your progress, the game autosaves on the world map and beating a level will give you an “M” in the top right corner of the overworld. As a disclaimer, the levels are organized on the overworld by theme, and not by ranking. This means that the quality of the levels might fluctuate dramatically from one to the next (e.g. having a 70th place entry directly before a 12th place entry). The bottom 8 and top 8 each have their own world, however, so it’s easy to distinguish them from the rest.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5v07.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SMW Central","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":63550,"name":"Super Comboman","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A 2D beat 'em up game published by Interabang Entertainment.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/i2ayyrfx1wsn1fikupzk.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":61262,"name":"Gakuen Heaven 2: Double Scramble!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Boys love themed visual novel.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co54pk.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Spray","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"PROTOTYPE","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":30231,"name":"Super ComboMan: Don't Mash Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Modern platforming action gets an extra helping of classic 2D fighting!

Players navigate around the open world using the Nintendo 3DS' touchscreen to find and befriend various Yo-kai, which are scattered across the overworld. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. A new feature in battles is using the touch screen to find a particular sweetspot on an enemy Yo-kai to increase the likelihood of befriending it at the end of the battle, or other sweetspots for extra damage, extra money, or extra experience. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Crank-a-kai (Gasha Machine) by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game's main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended. When the player encounters a Yo-kai, he enters into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player's Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai's Soultimate abilities. While the original Yo-kai Watch featured nearly 250 Yo-kai, Yo-Kai Watch 2 features nearly 450, including several that were featured as bosses in the original game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co24jl.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"LEVEL-5","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":8502,"name":"Sonic Jump Fever","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Catch the FEVER in an explosive race against the clock!
