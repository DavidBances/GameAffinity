You can win the game one of two ways:\n\nMove one die of your color to the opponents goal (This area is behind the starting line)\nHave all five of your dice on top of the other opponents.\nOn your turn you must move one of your dice to any orthagonal or diagonal space adjacent to this die. You may move your die on top of one or two (stacked dice). This means you will then create a stack of two or three, unless the space was empty. You may not create a stack of four. You can also move your cube on top of any stack to an adjacent space.\n\nIt takes 5-10 minutes per game, but the moves demand much attention and cleverness.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co390i.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Curiouspark, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":151675,"name":"Slash of Bullet","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An exhilarating VR game with a new sensation where you take down many enemy robots with sword slashes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co38tw.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"kan.kikuchi","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":151676,"name":"Craft the Mapcrafter: Gathering Magic Words","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An RPG where you gather words while travelling in a fantasy world.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co323p.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"KuroGameStudio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":151677,"name":"CosmoDreamer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"From the popular free game \"Outside\" comes a dreamy and cute barrage shmups.

Chris Crawford puts it this way:\n\n\"Wizard was spec'd as a 2K game, but just four months later, when it was ready, the marketing people had decided that everything should be 4K, so they asked me if I could expand it to 4K. To be honest, I really didn't want to work on the 2600 -- I was eager to get going on the 800. So I told them that you don't just expand a 2K game to 4K: you start from scratch and design it for 4K from the ground up. That was true, and marketing lost interest, so I got to move to the 800.\"\n\nSince Wizard was never advertised in any Atari catalogs and it was never assigned a part number, most people don't even know if its existence.\n\nWizard can best be described as a cross between Berzerk and Wizard of Wor. You control a wizard (at least I think he's a wizard), who must attempt to destroy the swirling star shaped creature. The board layout is a giant maze, which makes it hard to run from the creature and to get a clean shot off. Unfortunately the creature can move through the maze walls, but thankfully it can't shoot through them. Once you take a shot you'll notice that your wizard dims a bit, this means you are recharging, and cannot shoot. Once your wizard is done recharging he will light back up again, and you can take another shot. You don't have to worry about aiming you shots, as you will automatically shoot in the direction of the creature. This makes it easy to run away but still take shots at the creature.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co38sz.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Chris Crawford","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atari, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":151934,"name":"Loopmancer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Loopmancer is a 3D horizontal roguelite action game with realistic graphics that takes place in a cyberpunk universe.

The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way.
