The goal is to terminate Crocomire in the Dissolvery, which is locked behind 4 Security Locks, (Similar to Fusion) however one unique thing that this ROM hack does it that you have a great choice of which order you want to do things in. You could get Space Jump before even touching the Varia Suit, get the Plasma Beam as your second beam upgrade, everything is possible if you’re clever enough.\n\nThe major items also move around during a “CORE-X” playthrough, (This game’s equivalent to Hard Mode) granting even greater replay value, especially to get those nice ending pictures. And yes indeed, the player sprites have been changed to those of the SA-X from Fusion, making the hack the second one to ever have custom Samus graphics in Zero Mission.

Making this hack semi-unique in nature is, in persuit of MAXIMUM AUTHENTICITY, all tools, sprites, blocks, and music (barring resources made specifically for the project) are from 2007-2009 too. That's right, we're talking Lunar Magic 1.63, JonWill's Blktool, MikeyK's Sprite Tool 1.22, and Romi's Addmusic 4.04. Of course, this wouldn't be playable on hardware by default.

For SNESGT and ZSNES enthusiasts, you can also play the original unfixed (Japanese) version through this handy link right here. One may be quick to compare this to one of my previous hacking endeavors, but this is a very stylistically different hack that goes in a different direction.

Contact with a bullet will destroy your tank, earning your opponent a point, and the first player to five points wins the contest.\n\nThe current game has a couple of important differences from the original. The most important is that bullets do not just travel in a straight line after you fire them. They move in the direction in which you last directed your tank. This allows you to fire around corners, and even to shoot yourself (gifting your opponent a free point). Secondly, there are a number of different arenas which can be chosen, with different wall layouts. Some of these layouts also include a turn-style which allows you to pass but stops any pursuing bullets.
