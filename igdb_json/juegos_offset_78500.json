The game had to be completely reimplemented because the code of Anstoss 3 was considered too confused to be able to use it. This, as well as the short development time of only 12 months, meant that the program suffered from a large number of bugs that made it almost unplayable. Furthermore, the text and 3D mode was seen as too weak by the fan base and the manufacturer Ascaron was asked to make significant improvements. The manufacturer decided not to fix the program errors with patches, but rather to bring a new, revised manager onto the market based on Anstoss 4.\n\nAnstoss 4 is therefore considered to be the worst part of the Anstoss series, as it could not shine through playability, realism, or wit. Although the new database system, which now contained 145 countries, to which four leagues could be added, was praised by the manufacturer, it tended to cause very long waiting times, which massively delayed the game.\n\nAnstoss 4 differed from its predecessors not least in that the two main developers Gerald Köhler and Rolf Langenberg left the Ascaron team and switched to the competition from EA Sports to develop the soccer manager series there. Since then, the fan community has also split into two camps.\n\nAscaron was sued by its competitor Electronic Arts for license infringement shortly before the publication of Anstoss 4 and had to crush the entire CD production and change all player names.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2lyb.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ascaron","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":85735,"name":"Classic Arcadia & Baby Arcadia","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":85736,"name":"Jessy: Ein Zirkuspferd in Not","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":85737,"name":"L'Empereur","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"L'Empereur is a turn-based strategy video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released by the Koei company in 1989.\n\nThe user controls Napoleon Bonaparte during the Napoleonic Wars of the late 18th and early 19th Centuries.

Shortly before his death, he decided to reincarnate as a mortal many years later, so he came to the border of paradise, and spoke with the dragon demon Yinglong, who was supporting his rival before, as well as other demons. Yinglong descended upon the Earth, and his body parts turned into powerful weapons and artifacts - his claw became a sword, his eye a pearl, and his heart took the shape of a seal. The legends say that if someone can get one of the three artifacts, he can once again wield the power in the whole China.\n\nFast-forward to 196 AD. It is the time of Eastern Han dynasty, the end of one of the several golden epochs of the Chinese civilization. Two gods, Yunkong and Daotian, are playing chess with each other to decide the fate of China.
