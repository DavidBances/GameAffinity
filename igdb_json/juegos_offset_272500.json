No one man was given supreme command of all French forces in Spain, and French operations – though frequently successful on a local level, were marred by a lack of cooperation. This was made yet worse by Napoleon's own attempts to run the war by remote control from Paris, sending written orders that were out of date even before they were dispatched. \n \nThough often defeated, and similarly bereft of central control for the early years of the war, the Spanish leaders kept on putting fresh armies into the field, while the civilian populace refused to surrender and fought a bloody guerrilla war against the invaders. This tied down a large part of the French forces, limiting the numbers available to pursue further conquests. As a result, once their initial occupying army had been driven out in 1808, the French were never able to conquer Portugal, which was defended by its own reorganized forces and by a growing British contingent. The British were led by Arthur Wellesley, a man of outstanding ability who would subsequently get the better of Napoleon himself at Waterloo. Although initially the French had the upper hand, the reorganization of the Portuguese army by Beresford and the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras secured Portugal from French conquest. Thereafter, Portugal would become the base for the Anglo-Portuguese army that would eventually join with the Spanish to evict the French from the Peninsula. \n \nBonaparte's Peninsular War will take you through battles and campaigns focused in and around Portugal, but also branch out into Spain for some of the early war actions of 1809. The balance of the Peninsular conflict is covered in a follow-up title currently in development.

Two weeks after it was launched, it was obvious that the German forces were spent and little more could be achieved. On December 5th, 1941 aided by plummeting temperatures the Soviets launched what were first limited attacks, but quickly grew into front wide offensives that would last for close to three months. By the end of the Soviet offensives, Moscow was saved, but at what cost? \n \nMoscow '42 is two games in one. Following on from the German Operation Typhoon portrayed in Moscow '41, Moscow '42 includes the historical Soviet 1941/42 winter counter offensive that almost destroyed Heeresgruppe Mitte in front of Moscow. \n \nIn addition the hypothetical Fall Kreml (Operation Kremlin in English) is included. Operation Kremlin was an extensive deception campaign that the Axis enacted to distract from Fall Blau (Operation Blue) the German 1942 summer offensive in the Ukraine and Caucasus. What if Fall Kreml was real? What if the Axis attempted to capture Moscow again using the historical forces available in the summer of 1942? A range of campaigns & scenarios are included to allow players to investigate this historical possibility.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":142822,"name":"Panzer Campaigns: Moscow'41","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The German orders to capture of Moscow in October 1941 specified the use of 51 divisions, including 13 panzer divisions, to encircle the city.

And while both German and Russian High Commands were well aware of this, nevertheless, \"Operation Typhoon\" went ahead as planned. The attack was costly and first bogged down in endless mud, making the roads impassable. Next, the offensive was literally \"frozen in its tracks\" when the harsh Soviet winter set in. The Germans were not provided with winter clothing, and their vehicles and equipment were similarly not prepared. Yet despite all this, they reached the western suburbs, barely 17 km from the Kremlin, but before they ever encircled the city Soviet reinforcements arrived. Some of these new Russian troops were Siberian divisions, equipped and trained for winter fighting.
