This is how the list of candidates runs: there is a good programmer, an artist a bit scarce and a designer not bad; each of them, thanks to their skills, can give a more or less relevant hand in the realization of the project. Once everything is ready you must finally choose the kind and type of game to be realized, keeping in mind that some combinations will get married much better than others.\nIn Game Dev Story player can choose the platform on which to develop the project, and here things start to get very interesting. Game Dev Story in fact traces the last twenty years of the history of the video game industry, reproposing it in the form of an exhilarating parody: we start from the first computers, and then see almost all the major portable and home consoles announced. The names of companies, games and platforms have been revised, but are entirely traceable back to the originals; the Game Boy becomes the Game Kid and Microsoft is now Microx. However, in addition to the order in which the consoles are launched, the developers have chosen to keep even the success they have had at market level, which, on the one hand makes it even more pleasant to relive these twenty years from the inside , on the other hand, the player can easily predict big business and flop: nobody will be so crazy to develop a game for Virtual Boy (pardòn, Virtual Kid), while immediately supporting the fees of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 could lead to big boxing.\nThere are also annual awards, in which a jury rewards the best games of the year in the various categories. In the course of developing a project, however, the player will never remain with his hands: he will have to instruct his employees in order to cultivate their skills, buy the development kits of the various consoles, send announcements and look for new staff.\nIt is essential to keep the interest of the fans high, create hype and see the players line up days before the game, while sales can increase thanks to good reviews in specialized magazines. And yet, making a sequel to a successful game means starting the odds with good odds that the game sells, while the player can decide whether to invest everything in an ambitious project or make small titles in a very short time, until a budget has been reached. high enough to be able to make and place your console on the market.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4mcq.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kairosoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":19816,"name":"Z.H.P.

It is also in the water that you will catch bananas coming down the stream.\n\nBananas are necessary to get rid of the Bocondas; they can be placed on top of stones, and if a Boconda tries to jump at you, they will land on a banana and slip into the river where they are swept away. They are smart, though, so you will need to trick them into jumping onto your boobytrapped stones. Instead of tricking them, you can also swim to the river shore, pick up stones on the shore and throw them at the Bocondas to make them fall off their stones.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7g2t.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Studio GEN","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ASCII Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":19846,"name":"Scramble Eggs","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this scrolling shooter for the MSX, you control a gun that flies over mountains and shoots at white and purple eggs.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ample Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":19847,"name":"HunieCam Studio","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In HunieCam Studio players take control of a sleazy cam girl operation.

Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing about action-packed mecha on mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: Gunpla aka Gundam Model Kits! For those new to this specific spin-off, the core mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own Gundam based on the many real life parts featured in the game; the previous title, Gundam Breaker 2, included over 100 Gunpla kits to choose form, which massively increased the number of options and customizations available to a total of over 10,000,000,000 different options! Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own! The SD (Super Deformed) series of Gundam will now also be available in support roles, who will take instructions from the player during battles. SD Gundams can only be set to \"Module,\" the effects of which will extend to the full team. A new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ol3.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ilinx Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Crafts & Meister","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":19859,"name":"XCOM 2: Shen's Last Gift","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Investigate Advent’s \"Lost Towers\" facility where Chief Engineer Lily Shen accompanies your squad in search of her late father’s secretive final project.
