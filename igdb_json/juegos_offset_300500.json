Amidst the ensuing chaos and turmoil, a new council of representatives has taken power, supported by the revolutionaries that overthrew the king's regime. This 'grand council' is now in charge of overseeing the reconstruction of the region and establishing a new Pokemon league. But even under this supposed new stability, old fissures remain. Many Telius citizens detest the new government and how it operates and remain loyal to the longstanding traditions of supporting the nobility. This nobility and their soldiers, now on the outside looking in, has adopted the moniker 'Team Royale'. Operating from the shadows, they are a group intent on restoring the region to its former glory days under a new king. So with the region war-torn and divided, how will Telius move into the future? Enter YOU the player: the child of a noble family, you were sent away before the war began.
