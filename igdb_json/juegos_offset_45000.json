A wise king, one of the members of the Rameru family, managed to get a hold of the wing, and ordered that a deep cave be constructed where the wings would be hidden so that the wars would cease. The knowledge of the cave would be recorded and locked away, accessible only to the rulers of the land. Peace soon returned to the world.\n\nSeveral centuries later, a young member of the Rameru family known as Darutos learned of the location of the wing through the kingdom's secret archives. He betrayed the family and stole away with the Wing of Madoola. Using the power of the wing, he summoned demons to attack and take over castle Arekusu. He constructed an underground labyrinth beneath the castle, built a dangerous fortress, and planned to rule the world.The few survivors of Arekusu's military, and the remainder of the Rameru family fled the castle. They regrouped and devised a desperate plan to overthrow Darutos and regain control of the kingdom. Lucia, a brave warrior, was selected to accompany a member of the Rameru family who was uniquely capable of wielding magic known only to his family.\n\nAs they approached Arekusu, they were beset upon by two powerful demons. While one distracted Lucia, the other attacked the Rameru family member. Lucia battled both demons and defeated them, but not before her partner received a fatal wound. Knowing what had to be done, Lucia bravely pressed forward, knowing that only she could stop Darutos, and regain possession of the Wing of Madoola.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co239u.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48615,"name":"Baseball Fighter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Baseball Fighter is a Sports game, developed by Graphic Research and published by Vap, which was released in Japan in 1991.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3s65.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Graphic Research","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"VAP","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":48616,"name":"Asmik-kun Land","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons.

While there are fundamental RPG components in place such as equipment, shops, town exploration, and experience points, the actual combat takes place in real-time. The player only controls the protagonist directly, but can issue different strategic commands to other party members that, in turn, influence their AI as they fight. Furthermore, while fights do consist of random encounters, they take place on the same playing field as the game world itself, meaning that there are no transitions into battle-specific arenas like turn-based RPGs at the time such as Final Fantasy.

He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.\n\nThe Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9fm2.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":48966,"name":"Ninja Boy 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ninja Boy 2 is an Action game, developed and published by Culture Brain, which was released in Japan in 1991.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4wor.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Culture Brain Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":48967,"name":"Ninja Boy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ninja Boy is an Action game, developed and published by Culture Brain, which was released in Japan in 1990","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4wo5.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Culture Brain Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":48968,"name":"Knight Quest","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sir Will accepts a series of bold quests to defend his land.
