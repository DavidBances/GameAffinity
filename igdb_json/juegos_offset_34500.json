The tank can move in 8 directions. The fire button causes the tank to shoot in the direction it is moving. On each screen, there are active and dormant enemy tanks. As the screens progress, the tanks are worth more and more, but the dormant tanks are always worth twice as much as the active ones. Of course they are well guarded! The scenery consists of a few trees and a river which you can only cross by bridge. If you shoot an active tank, one of the dormant tanks will spring to life and come after you. The object of the game is to clear the level and go on to the next one before they kill you. Each succeeding level has more enemies, and moves faster and faster. The game plays a tune at the start of each level, and then there is a JAWS-like tune that it plays as you play. As the battle gets more and more frantic, so does the music. The tank makes a simple but interesting sound that is unique to this game.

The player oversees a 10 x 10 square field where the first four rows (three on easy) have been filled by blocks. Each block shows one of three symbols, a dark gray circle, a light gray circle, and a white circle. When ever any of blocks with matching symbols touch they will form a link. By moving the cursor over a chain and clicking on it the player will be given points based on its size on the chain will be removed. The goal is to get a large score while making sure that new pieces can still enter the field. Once no more pieces can enter the game ends. Blocks fall at the same time one square apart, when the next set of blocks fall they will occupy the space given by the previous drop.\n\nThe \"magnet\" aspect of Mingle Magnet come into play in how the player can control the placement of the blocks. All the blocks are attracted to a magnet which, although not seen, can be placed on any side of the field. All blocks will be drawn to the magnet. For example, if one has the magnet at the south of the field and then puts it to the north what was the top of the block pile will now be the bottom, and blocks will fall onto what was the bottom. The direction of the magnet is indicated by a magnetic field animation behind the action.\n\nThis game is played vertically.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4r59.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mechanic Arms","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HAL Laboratory","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan"}]},{"id":37568,"name":"Detective Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki!?","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Detective Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki!? is an Adventure game, developed by Tomcat System and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2000.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pjl5fxrsjjvtjpidjzp4.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tomcat System","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan"}]},{"id":37569,"name":"Detective Conan: Majutsushi no Chousenjou!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Detective Conan is an Adventure game, developed by Tomcat System and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1999.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/krukdeim0ymqtgnsqanj.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan"}]},{"id":37570,"name":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kuwagata Version","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kuwagata Version is a Role-Playing game, developed by Natsume and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1999.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4ueu.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Imagineer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Natsume Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan"}]},{"id":37571,"name":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kabuto Version","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kabuto Version is a Role-Playing game, developed by Natsume and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1999.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4uev.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Imagineer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Natsume Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan"}]},{"id":37572,"name":"Meta Communication Therapy: Nee Kiite!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Meta Communication Therapy: Nee Kiite!

One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.\n\nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.\n\nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.\n\nThe Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4mkk.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Polydor","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sand Storm","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Right Stuff","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"}]},{"id":37579,"name":"Bakushou Yoshimoto ShinkiGeki","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings.

The game features extensive anime sequences between levels to recreate the feeling of the show, and these are well drawn although quite heavy in dialogue. The gameplay itself is nothing new - you have a primary weapon and optional secondary weapon that is extra powerful, and you have to mow down the Zentradi forces in your Valkyrie (which only gets to transform at specific points). Power-up pods increase your firepower a little each time, while hidden Minmay heads give extra lives.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":37589,"name":"Fighting Street","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Street Fighter was ported under the changed title Fighting Street for the TurboGrafx-CD and released with an arranged soundtrack.
