To highlight this new game mode, three VIP maps were included: Trainyard with a single capture point and a one-life VIP, Mineside with a VIP-exclusive briefcase that must be delivered to unlock the capture point, Harbor with three capture points and no special gimmicks, and a VIP version of Badwater Basin with four capture points (later reduced to three) and a nighttime atmosphere.\n\nAnother major feature was the addition of Four-Team mode, shattering the previous paradigm of RED and BLU by introducing GRN and YLW. The new Four-Team maps were the Arena map Flask, and a Domination version of Hydro - which itself is a new game mode, with Oil Canyon as a two-team exemplar. The update also brought back 9 new weapons based on unreleased Team Fortress 2 content, as well as 6 weapons and 31 maps that already exist in TF2.\n\nIn addition, most mechanics were rebalanced based on Team Fortress 2 updates, and the vast majority of the game was refactored in design, interface, and content.

Experience a story-driven campaign! Fight for your Sanity and defeat the Lovecraftian horrors.\n\nLast Spartan sees you playing as the titular Last Spartan as you battle through a story-driven randomly generated campaign where keeping a grip on your waning sanity becomes increasingly difficult as you do battle with more and more enemies that draw inspiration from Greek mythology and the Lovecraft mythos.\n\nIt's a roguelike with deck-building elements. The unique part here is that your deck is actually a set of customisable dices, with each face acting as a slot for a different ability. There are over 700+ dice faces to discover, allowing you to develop and learn numerous synergies to suit your preferred playstyle, especially when god selection comes into play.\n\nAside from the dice, you will be accompanied on each run by an ally Greek god. There are over 10 of them currently, although they won't all be unlocked immediately, and each provides distinct active and passive abilities. With them, you can develop different strategies for dealing with the many foes you encounter.\n\nAccording to the developer, for the first ten hours, you will face new enemies on every run, with over 100 regular enemies and 20-plus mini-bosses to discover and fight in turn-based combat. This should keep the game feeling fresh and surprising for far longer than other entries in the genre.\n\nThe same applies to encounters with over 200 NPCs to meet and choices surrounding them to make. Depending on your interaction, they might provide you with a reward, blessings, or even curses that will remain constant until the end of that particular run.\n\nSome of those NPCs will make their way to your city. It's here where you respawn after dying and spend resources you've gathered throughout each run to upgrade the various buildings in a bid to rebuild Sparta.
