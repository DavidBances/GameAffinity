Update differed from previous updates by including two competitions, operating inside and outside the game. The first was announced at the start of the update; a kill tracker appeared in the HUD of anybody playing as a Demoman or Soldier, with the counter increasing each time they (as a Soldier) killed an enemy Demoman or they (as a Demoman) killed an enemy Soldier. The personal totals of each player were added to a mass tally, and with each day of the update a running total score for each side was displayed on the update page. The Soldier won with 6,406,065 total kills to the Demoman's 6,372,979, granting the Soldier the prize of an extra unlockable weapon, the Gunboats.\n\nThe second competition was the Propaganda Contest. Users were encouraged to design propaganda posters for the side of their choice, supporting either the BLU Soldier or RED Demoman. The posters were then submitted to Valve to be judged through the Propaganda Contest website. The three leading prizes were later revealed to be J.Axer's Dapper Topper, Amber's Rad As All Hell Hat, and Uncle Sam (for first, second, and third place respectively).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6qlk.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Valve","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":256432,"name":"Bad Roads","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Go as far as possible with your shipment.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":256433,"name":"Castle Ramble","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Castle Ramble is an infinite Roguelite Platformer for your mobile devices from the developers of Unbroken Soul!

The complicated part of driving is parking of course. With the rising number of cars and the lack of parking space makes, the situation even worse. This is the reason why bumps and scrapes are quite common when parking your car which really turns you off. Next time when you park somewhere, keep the following tips in mind to maintain your car properly. Follow the below parking tips in our new free 3d parking game.\n1.For parking, First and the foremost thing you need to do is to reduce the speed to minimum when you have found the place. Then, decide whether you want to go reverse or nose first. Go slowly as this greatly decreases your chance for mistake. In addition, it will get you time to think all your movements and correct your mistakes on the go you can learn this in our 3D parking simulation\n2.While parking your car, leave enough space between your car and adjacent cars. This will help the fellow drivers to move their car out of park easily and without striking yours.\n3.In packed parking lots, drivers get competitive for parking space. This can be very risky. Keeping your vehicle in control is important at all times. Don’t show an offensive behaviour while parking your vehicle. This can annoy other car drivers sharing the same parking region.\n4.Don’t ignore things that make the job of parking easier. If you’re moving backwards, turn around and look behind you; if you’re moving forward, look straight ahead of you. Also ensure that your fellow drivers are aware of your presence. Keep I mind that sometimes your fellow drivers will overlook you so keep aware anytime!","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":256437,"name":"Pixel Survival Game 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"How will you craft your house on the deserted island?\nWill you survive alone?

With no ability to support their troops abroad, Spain admitted defeat within just five months.\n\nThe war took place during a period of unprecedented changes in naval technology and doctrine, with stark differences from one ship to the next. Both sides suffered from a variety of unforeseen challenges, be it from lack of experience or preparedness. In the end, the numerical, qualitative and home-field advantages carried the day for the United States.\n\nBut what if events had turned out differently? In addition to the two historical and rather one-sided battles, this game also depicts many hypothetical situations in which commanders made different decisions at key moments or had more resources to work with.
