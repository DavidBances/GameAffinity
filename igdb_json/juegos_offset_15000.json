Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2c6p.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Product Development Division 6","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":15844,"name":"Treasure Hunter G","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting.

Nine years after the first ill-fated attempt and five years after the second, an Æon Flux game was finally completed and released to the market in November 2005.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g3w.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Terminal Reality","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Majesco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":15848,"name":"Neugier: Umi to Kaze no Kodou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Duke, the son of Count Wein of Neugier, was exiled from the country by his father a long time ago.

This flight can be issued commands; attack other aircraft or ground targets, fly home if they are damaged, or jettison their drop tanks.

The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them.

The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.\n\nCombat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co308n.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Group SNE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Advance Communication Company","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tonkin House","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":16472,"name":"Cyber Knight II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This epic arcade adventure features a brave Knight on a quest to find the only thing that will release his beloved from a curse that has turned her into a dragon - the magical Grail.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jdl.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Group SNE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tonkin House","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":16473,"name":"Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Battle as Eddie in his many guises across worlds inspired by the rich lore and music of Iron Maiden - one of the most iconic and influential bands of all time.\n\nA mysterious force has shattered Eddie’s soul and scattered the shards.

Ranged weapons, melee weapons, armor, special attacks, ally / PC healing, and more have been reworked and carefully tested to create an engaging and challenging combat experience.  Even the core combat system has been tweaked so that AC is calculated before damage reduction; this change makes combat more consistent and more fair, and corrects the “invincible” armor problem.\n\nSmarter AI: Medic, Guard, Grenadier, Sniper, and more - New AI behaviors and schemas exist for human enemies, making them more interesting and more challenging to fight!  Enemies will notice your presence more quickly, follow you around corners and through doors, and fully utilize all of their tactical options, thrown weapons, and special attacks.\n\nNew PC Infection option on New Game menu: Create a new game with PC Infection checked and your character will be as susceptible to infection as your allies are.  Carefully manage your antibiotics and change your combat strategies to ensure your own survival!\n\nHardcore Mode: Just in case living in the apocalypse wasn’t hard enough for you.  In Hardcore mode combat becomes more dangerous, allies consume more resources and heal more slowly, and Morale is harder to keep up.  Turn on Hardcore, Iron Man, and PC Infection for the ultimate challenge.\n\nAlarms: That’s right - we’ve added alarms to buildings in several areas.  Red, blinking lights warn you that there’s an active alarm on a building. Use your Science skill to deactivate an alarm and prevent a looting distraction from becoming a noisy attraction.\n\nNew areas and random encounters: Several new levels and random encounters have been added.  Make sure to keep an eye out for the Chemical Plant, an area with a unique twist…\n\nNew combat sounds and animations: We’ve added new special attack, reloading, and healing animations and sounds.  Special attacks feel smoother and more impactful now.\n\nStability improvements: We’ve rooted out every crash and progress blocking bug to make sure you have the smoothest possible experience.  Several popularly requested usability improvements have been added, such as friendly fire conformation, looting piled up bodies, and an option to toggle Live Shelter movement on and off.\n\nPathfinding improvements: Both allies and the undead have received major pathfinding adjustments that will reduce lag some people have experienced as well as make movement more consistent and natural.About the GameAbout the Game\nDead State is a compelling, high-tension survival RPG set in central Texas at the collapse of civilization and the dawn of the undead apocalypse.\n\nAs society is beginning to fall apart, the player must organize a group of survivors together, fortify a shelter, scout for food and supplies, negotiate with or defend against other factions, and maintain order inside the shelter as humanity teeters on the brink of extinction. Dead State is a full-fledged RPG featuring base building and management, turn-based tactical combat, and reactive story and dialogue with an emphasis on survival at any cost. \n\nAttract new allies, scavenge food and supplies, and protect your shelter at any cost. Do you have what it takes to lead a desperate group through a crisis? This is your chance to find out.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ryo62cafrzlkpbuxsisy.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DoubleBear Productions","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":16548,"name":"Rain Blood Chronicles: Mirage","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mirage is an action adventure in which you will need to gear up to clear the 8 levels in this game and by doing so you will eventually learn the truth of Mirage.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2214.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":16550,"name":"Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The world's speediest homage/roast to JRPGs!
