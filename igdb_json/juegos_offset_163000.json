Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.\n\nPlaying as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area.

The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future.

He's on holiday from school and wants to find the treasure buried in his carrot patch. He has six relatives each of which has a clue so, with the help of the pupil, off he goes. Each visit is in two parts, for example visiting Granny in the frozen north starts with a request to click on all the items beginning with a specific letter to defrost them. There's usually around half a dozen items on the ground of which four match the specified criteria. Once this task has been completed the pupil goes to an ice hockey practice session. Here a letter is shown on the scoreboard and hockey pucks with three and four letter words are slid over the ice. If the initial letter of the word matches the target letter the pupil clicks on the puck and, if they're right, it's fired into the net. If the initial letter does not match the target letter they click on the referee and the puck melts away. After completing the mini games the player is shown a clue to the carrot patch treasure, this specifies a letter. The player is then taken to the carrot patch where they must identify the letter from those shown, they click on it, a tunnel is dug to that spot where there will be an object and a small animation. Different games stress different reading elements. Alfie the Jazz Hamster asks the pupil to choose words that rhyme, Grandad gets the pupil to match upper and lower case letters, Flash asks the pupil to spell/complete words that come from a volcano while Robbie at the ranch expects pupils to decide whether a word is real of not.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8cts.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Knowledge Adventure","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":176016,"name":"Magic Farm","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"While you're away at school studying horticulture, you receive terrible news -your beloved parents are missing!

The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.\n\nParticipation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it's necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour.
