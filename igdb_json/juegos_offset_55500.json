Be prepared, it won't take just a few data packets to end this quest; the virtual road ahead is not just perilous, but long. Alt, however, won't be alone; with the special guidance of the trusty and quirky Magna, whacky characters joining in, and, of course, your help, his chances couldn't be better!\n\nEarly Access Out Now!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4jno.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"αGlitch","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":75304,"name":"Dolmen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dolmen is an action game with RPG elements, where the player’s worst fears turn against him, finding the aberrant alien world of Revion Prime.
