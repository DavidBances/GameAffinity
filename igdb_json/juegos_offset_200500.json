The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).\n\nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.\n\nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.\n\nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ldv.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":38416,"name":"Universal Soldier","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based on the major motion picture, this awesome action adventure takes you from the steaming shell-pocked jungles of Southeast Asia to laser-seared battlefields at home.\n\nYou are a perfectly engineered Universal Soldier with extraordinary skills and powers - locked in mortal combat against your old Vietnam foe, the villainous Sergeant Scott.

A handful of survivors escape to the jungle and start working on a counter attack - but they are soon discovered and are now running out of time, and they must launch the Daisenpū squadron before it is fully operational. The player takes control of a fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy territory, attack ground targets such as tanks, turrets and warships (the game curiously doesn't feature any flying enemies and no obstacles to fly into, beside enemy bullets). The plane starts equipped with a limited double-shot machine gun that can be slowly upgraded throughout the game by collecting power-pods left behind by small trucks. But the originality of Daisenpū lies elsewhere - the player can call a small squadron of six planes and have them fly in formation, shooting anything in sight and crashing into an enemy unit when defeated. The squadron can also commit a Kamikaze attack at anytime and destroy ground units, or combine to release a devastative bomb-attack.

Cat have probably never heard of Tom & Jerry, but they’re just as single-minded: any means to hurt the adversary is a good one. They get plenty of means in Incredible Toons. Around 100 puzzles need to be solved, each one a 2D machine of which crucial parts are missing. The player's task is to choose useful objects from a separate window, position them on the screen and start the machine to see if it’s working. A simple example: a piano hanging from a rope needs to be dropped on Al. To accomplish this, you place open scissors next to the cable and drop a ball on them - voila, the rope is cut, Al crushed. However, most puzzles are far more complicated; for example, the player might first have to lure Al under the piano with a fish, which needs to be transported to the right location by conveyor belts. \n \nThe puzzles involve a score of contraptions, ranging from simple ropes and pulleys to balloons, trapdoors, catapults, bombs, electrical hairdryers, and motors. Sid and Al are accompanied by several other cartoon characters, such as the lady elephant Eunice who will toss things around, or the pet dragon Bik that ignites objects with his fiery breath. \n \nGameplay is spiced up with cartoon animations -- Al chasing Sid is a sight to remember. If the player has solved all of the puzzles, the player can build own challenges with the comfortable editor. Oh, be sure to learn Sid & Al’s lessons well -- you never know when you need to get rid of a mouse with nothing but some cheese, a trapdoor and an anvil.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1lwg.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":79883,"name":"Coaster","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The basic goal of \"Coaster\" is quite simply to build a roller coaster.

The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2y6v.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":145329,"name":"Heaven & Earth","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A surreal collection of puzzles and card games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wwg.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":145266,"name":"Disney's Darkwing Duck","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Darkwing Duck is a video game for the TurboGrafx-16 console.

As the game opens, the Master of Mischief, the common antagonist to the Super Seekers games, uses a weather machine to freeze the mountain in snow and ice and scatters the castle's treasures all over the mountain. The player takes on the role of the Super Seeker, whose job is to find the scattered treasures and return them to the castle's treasure chest in order to thaw out the mountain.\n\nThe mountain itself consists of three levels. The player cannot climb higher until he has gathered the supplies, like ice axes, ladders, or catapult parts, useful for scaling the mountain. To obtain these items, the players must help out the local inhabitants complete math-related tasks such as adjusting clocks to a given time, balancing scales, and counting crystals.\n\nIn order to find treasures, the player must place a specific amount of snowballs at a certain location. To find out how many snowballs are needed, the player must catch an elf carrying a scroll. If he answers the riddle correctly, he will be told how to find treasures on that particular level.\n\nOnce the player reaches the top of the castle on the highest level of the mountain, he deposits all treasures found into the castle's treasure chest and is given a prize as a reward for completing the three stages. This prize is kept on display in the player's clubhouse, showing how many times he has ascended the mountain. These prizes are usually children's toys, such as flutes or toy trains. From this point, the player may exit the clubhouse and start again from the bottom of the mountain. At higher ranks, the game becomes more difficult, as there will be more treasures to find, harder riddles to answer, and snowbullies that steal money.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co50dw.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":73809,"name":"Loader Larry","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Larry Lontrose is a part-time dock loader.
