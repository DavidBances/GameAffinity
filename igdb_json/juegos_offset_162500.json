For some scenarios, a few infantry units may represent an entire wing of a larger battle, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave soldiers going over the top. The Command card system drives movement, creates a “fog of war” and presents players with many interesting opportunities; while the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe Combat cards add an element of suspense and will challenge players to coordinate their use in a timely manner. Overall, the battlefield tactics players will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various types of WWI units, their weapons, battlefield terrain, and written history.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":175384,"name":"Tens and Twos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tens and Twos is simple to play and anyone can pick it up.
