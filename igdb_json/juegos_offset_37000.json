Two heroes are willing to carry out this mission, with a few minor differences in gameplay: the first aircraft is specialized in concentrated direct fire, the second in the deployed shot. Of course, the game offers you its selection of power-ups and special weapons, such as auxiliary and self-guided lasers. The course of the game is rather neat with a certain sense of staging. The big enemies arrive from afar and see their shadow emerge under a heap of clouds before presenting themselves to you is still very pleasant, as are the enemies coming out of destroyed buildings. Stage 3 is an infiltration into an enemy armada: you will see the long enemy ship scrolling from the beginning of the level, before finding it later in the level, armed and ready to fight ... In short, it is very classic As a plot, but some care has been taken in the script, which does not spoil anything. With this in mind, the boss is a small robot that returns to the end of each level with new attacks, which will put your speed to dodge and your sense of positioning to the test. Let's play the game from a more down-to-earth point of view. The graphics without being catastrophic, is not brilliant for all that; This type of visual is not without evoking the consoles 16 bits, which count among their ranks many shmups more pleasant to look. The animation is without great problem, except for a few flashes of sprites, just noted for information because they are finally quite minor. What makes the Rapid Hero's charm is actually how it forces the player to anticipate. The enemy's salvos are fast in devils and admirable in symmetry. Of course, we can predict their move to the screen, but having to deal with 5, 6 or even 7 types of enemy movements sprinkled with a few pellets requires precision in the maneuvers, and it is finally this gameplay that ensures its interest in Rapid Hero . And in case you've made a mistake, there's always the smart bomb to get you out of it ... To conclude, Rapid Hero is an honest and entertaining shmup that will hook the player without being a masterpiece of its kind. Its precise gameplay will delight fans of old school shmups who will find there the sensations of Super Nintendo and Megadrive.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co66oq.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39882,"name":"Bostilda","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A.B.

The basic goal of each level is to get to the end, but the way you get there is anything but a straight line. Your plane (which can go in any direction, pulling off loop-de-loops and such at will) has a constantly depleting fuel gauge, forcing you to do one of two things: you can shoot down other planes to refill some fuel, or you can jump out of your plane and try to hijack one from an enemy. You only have a couple of parachutes, though, so you have to be careful - if you miss your shot and don't have any left, you'll go splat. If you do have a parachute (which you can earn more of by shooting down a certain number of enemies from the same wave) you'll glide down and have to face various hazards on the road while you search for a new plane. It's refreshing how open-ended the game is laid out. Although your destination lies all the way to the right of the stage, you have free reign to go wherever you please. If you stay close to the ground you'll avoid enemies, but that also means that you'll be out of luck when you run out of fuel (which happens quickly, especially if you're using turbo). Or, you could go high and get into some seriously intense dog-fights, or even backtrack if you missed a wave of cool looking planes you want to hijack. Other decisions you have to make are based around the fuel gauge, which decreases extremely quickly. Do you focus on shooting other planes, or go the more risky route by trying to hijack? The former is usually the safe bet, but it's incredibly fun to try out all the new planes being thrown your way. You have to be careful, though, as hijacking different enemies produces different effects. While other planes are typically a safe bet, other enemies are sometimes not. For example, trying to hijack the flying pigs results in you either wasting a parachute or falling to your death, and UFO's zap you if you try to get on them. Though there isn't as much variety in the levels as I would like, there are constantly new enemies thrown at you, which are really the star of the show anyway. Through and through the action stays frantic and intense, with some opportunities for some really memorable moments. It's a perfect example of the easy to pick up, hard to master philosophy of game design. Newcomers can have a blast even when they're dying every twenty seconds, and it's an absolute blast trying to perfect your game. While I'm not usually into self-imposed challenges, it's super fun trying to finish a level without dying and keeping the same plane. Graphically, the game is astounding for 1984, and still serves the game nicely today. The colors are very bright and vivid, the cartoony art style is great, and everything moves at a brisk pace. The audio design don't fare as well, though - get ready for a lot of bleeps and bloops. One other thing to note is that, unlike so many games of the era, you don't have to start over at the beginning when you die. Instead, you start right back from where you left off. I can't express how delighted I was to find that out, because although it might be \"hardcore\", it simply sucks having to replay the beginning over and over again in other games. It might be a bit obscure, and it's not perfect, but as far as I'm concerned Acrobatic Dog-Fight is a classic and an absolute must-play.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vqj8gvrq46h1cd5efrr2.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Technos Japan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Data East USA","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39972,"name":"Gun Loco","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gun Loco was an Xbox 360-exclusive shooter in development at Square Enix Europe which has been canceled.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ltb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix Europe","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":39973,"name":"Gekirindan","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gekirindan is a vertical shoot-'em-up by Taito where players select one of three different fighters against an army of mechs through different time periods.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co483n.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"JAMP","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Japan)","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":39974,"name":"Space Fever","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shoot aliens as they move across the screen.

The level design is particularly creative, along with a unique charge shot and bombs. It gets its name from the Sanskrit word for \"Flying Machine\", described in Sanskrit Epics. The storyline involves a planet being attacked by seemingly indestructible alien forces that induce fear and insanity to all that oppose them. The last hope for this planet is the Vimana Warriors, two ships that are empowered by the Hindu god Ganesha to defend against the aliens and restore peace to the galaxy.\n\nThe Vimana warriors are the player one and player two ships, each equipped with a shot that charges in the shape of a V. Once the shot is released, the V shape explodes forth in an arc, hitting almost everything in front of it. This sounds like it would be a very powerful weapon, but this leads to Vimana's main problem - none of your attacks ever do enough damage. Even the weakest enemies will take more than a few hits to destroy, even if your weapon is fully powered up. Bombs are similarly underwhelming, consisting of seven balls of light that rotate around your ship and guard you from shots. Once an enemy comes onto screen, a light ball will jump out from the group and crash into the enemy, likely destroying or heavily damaging it. Unlike in Fire Shark, where you can pick up new weapons, Vimana does not offer any weapons other than standard shots, charge shots, and bombs.\n\nVimana has some bits of creativity in its levels. One in particular has moving enemy searchlights, which will fire hard to dodge bullets if it spots you. An interesting boss fires from the bottom of the screen as opposed to the top. Vimana also attempts to squeeze around 50 enemy bullets on screen at once, making it feel like a sort of prototype bullet hell shooter.\n\nVimana was never ported to any home systems, but like Out Zone it would not have really fit onto any of them very well. The music was done by Toshiaki Tomizawa, who would later go on to make soundtracks for Fixeight, another Toaplan shooter and many of Cave's games, including Dodonpachi, Progear, Guwange, and ESP Ra.

When collecting the special dragon skull that randomly appears after defeating an enemy, the Tecmo Knight will summon the most powerful creature to ride on in the game: the Flying Dragon. Tecmo Knight is immune to attack while riding Flying Dragon, whose breath kills any monster in the game instantly, including the stage-end bosses. Using the \"jump and attack\" maneuver, Tecmo Knight can bound Smokeman or the tiger onto enemies and pummel them. \n \nSometimes, if Tecmo Knight runs low on life, a blow by a weak monster will kill only Smokeman or the tiger, leaving Tecmo Knight to fend for himself with a very weak short-ranged attack.

Any pirate who stands in the way of a barrel or other object will be hurled off the screen.

Every floor of the ship has a set number of pirates to be destroyed, as well as a single \"Bow\", a special pirate that regenerates each time it is defeated. Every fourth level in the game yields a bonus level in which the barrels are worth an increased number of points, and a group of enemies entirely made up of Bows (which do not regenerate in this case). With each successive floor, the speed and intelligence of the pirates increases. For every sixteen barrels Momotaro destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them.

The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch.\n\nThe action is fast-paced and smooth.

It is incredible how many elements from other games are squeezed into a surprisingly fun melange platformer. Hard Head (and his twin in 2-player mode) carries a bubble gun that encloses enemies into bubbles, which can then be used as trampoline, just like in Bubble Bobble. Similar to Super Mario Bros, items are gained from blocks by jumping at them with the hero's head, while enemies are defeated by stepping on theirs. Then there's passages where one has to break through walls by using a hammer, which is very reminiscent of Wrecking Crew. \n \nHowever, other than with contemporary titles of home entertainment companies like Clover and Zemina, the designer (who sadly isn't credited at all) had also a few quite unique ideas, like working musical instruments used as platforms, a football that can be found in every stage and kicked through a goal at the level end for extra points. There even is a day/night change hinted at through pallette rotation of the mostly monocoloured background. The game has a time limit, but rather than just killing the player off when it runs out, more and more evil suns come attacking the player already when only little time is left. \n \nThe game can be enjoyed by two players simultaneously, who can use each other's head as a springboard to reach higher places without relying on nearby enemies. Only in the second half the game tends to get a bit tedious, as there's almost no new elements introduced after the middle, and those from the early stages grow old fast because of their steady repetition. Less interesting is also the music, which is mostly snatched together from various classical pieces.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SunA Co.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":40180,"name":"Hard Head 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hard Head 2 is a much more reasonably assembled platformer than its predecessor, which almost makes it more boring.

One day, Nyan questions the Chinese Zodiac and wonders why a cat isn't part of the zodiac while others like the dog and monkey are. Dodonpa isn't really bothered by it so much and sort of teases Nyan but then he too wonders about it and Nyan (feeling inspired) gets optimistic. The story of the game has Nyan and Dodonpa eventually going to meet a fairy after battling 12 animals (specifically of the Chinese Zodiac) in order to make the request that cats be part of the zodiac. Apparently, if you play with player 2 and beat the game, the ending is slightly different or so I hear. \n \nKokontouzai Eto Monogatari (KEM from this point forward) roughly translates into \"Chinese Astrology Story for All Ages\". However, the game has a lot of stages for a puzzle game (13 to be exact) and the speed picks up pretty quickly so as childish as it looks, it definitely requires skill on the later levels. It is a fairly simple and charming game (it's funny how the cow/ox of stage 2 will \"power-up\" and win by drinking milk, lol), but the CPU definitely shows aggression pretty quickly (if you couldn't tell by watching this video). Visually, the game is pretty good and doesn't do anything over-the-top, but still manages to be pretty decent for the genre. The audio is okay; I don't have any qualms with it, but nothing really jumps out at me (the music is geared for the kids). It's not necessarily my cup of tea, but it isn't necessarily bad (I have different tastes in music). \n \nKEM plays like many other drop puzzlers in the general sense; you match three blocks and they disappear. You can create chains and drop big piles of junk on your opponent. To destroy said junk and get your breathing room back, you must match blocks that are touching the junk. When you do so, the blocks and junk next to it will both vanish. KEM does have a trick up its sleeve; orbs that when matched, destroy all treasure boxes (just another type of block that you can chain with) as well as any orbs you didn't match that are scattered on your screen. By matching three orbs together when your screen is full of blocks, you can cause massive chain reactions or massive gatherings of blocks to be destroyed all at once. Naturally, you will deal a huge blow to your adversary when you do this so timing is essential (and the opponent can too so watch out!). \n \nAt any rate, KEM is a pretty decent game to play with silly characters and decent audio/visuals.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":40230,"name":"Koi No Hotrock","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rock band members try to save the female vocal who has been abducted.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jcxz69hovxrp3gitmu6h.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":40231,"name":"Knock Out!!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A maze game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xdrc2nclcdxrhtr2k29m.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore 16"}]},{"id":40232,"name":"Car Jamboree","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A driving demolition game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6gha.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Omori Electronics","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":40233,"name":"Big Fight: Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Big Fight: Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean, is a 1992 fighting game / belt scrolling beat 'em up-hybrid arcade game developed and published by Tatsumi, and is one of their last arcade games before focusing on novelty sticker printing business.

In Korea, the game was originally published before the summer vacation of 1997, but called back for some reason, and not sold again until November the same year. At first sales were slow because of the low machine price of 250,000 Won (which lead arcade owners assume low quality), but after word-of-mouth had spread, the game became a hit in its home country, too6. \n \nWhile it didn't bring anything new on the shmup table, Red Hawk's biggest strength was its bombastic arsenal, throwing together all kinds of weapon systems that are seen in the genre. Besides the highly upgradeable standard weapon, planes can charge for a devastating, screen filling special attack. Those don't replace smart bombs, though, as those are available, too. Finally, there's a number of sattelites to further boost fire power. All weapons are unique for each of the four different pilots, too. \n \nThe game originally used an upright monitor, but for some reason some of the European releases swapped the horizontal and vertical resolution around for ordinary display orientation. This makes the game noticably harder, as enemies are seen later.
