This is a definite must-have for RPG veterans and novices alike. Might and Magic: Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Find the secret of the Inner Sanctum. Cross oceans, climb mountains, search castles and dungeons, all in 3-D color perspective. Use 94 different spells and over 250 magic items to deal with over 200 monsters of various descriptions and personality profiles. Might and Magic 2: Gates to Another World. Embark on a glorious journey, then save the world of CRON and yourself. Hundreds of quests matched to your personal proficiency will test your ingenuity, and over 250 animated monsters will contest your might in an advanced combat system; 96 spells, more than 250 weapons and items, two new character classes, hirelings, and 15 secondary skills will aid your cause. Might and Magic 3: Isles of Terra. Terra awaits you. Prepare to be charmed by its magic and tested by its mighty power. Lead a party of adventurers to rendezvous with the legendary wizard, Corak. From dark moldy dungeons, through corridors of hewn stone and timber, and onward to the lofty frozen peaks of Terra, you will uncover the mysteries that surround the exotic islands in the Great Sea. Bizarre and intriguing creatures will challenge you along the way and in the many towns and castles that dot your path. Might and Magic 4: Clouds of Xeen. Explore the Land of Xeen--a world that has fallen under the iron grip of a diabolical overlord. Create a party of adventurers and journey to the four corners of your imagination as you strive to complete your mission. Take on fantastic quests, fearsome monsters, and challenges beyond compare. When you are ready, journey to the cloud world and face the ultimate foe: Lord Xeen himself. Might and Magic 5: Darkside of Xeen. The Tyrant Alamar appeared shortly after the Night of the Falling Stars and deposed Queen Kalindra, ruler of the humans. Alamar's army has besieged the Dragon Pharaoh's pyramid, and rebel monsters are ravaging the countryside and destroying the travel pyramids. Humans and their ilk have been confined to the slums of Castleview. And now fate has elected you and your friends to carry a message of vital importance to one of the few people who can still make a difference. Might and Magic: Swords of Xeen. Nothing is known about Havec, the world on the other side of a newly discovered magical pyramid, except that the evil Lord Xeen, who nearly destroyed two worlds, regularly traveled through the pyramid for unknown purposes. Travel from the small city of Greyhaven in the world of Xeen to Havec in this game that reprises the popular game system of World of Xeen in a new and challenging adventure. Install both Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen on your hard drive to create the World of Xeen. Journey back and forth and solve the multiple crossover quests to experience a special third end game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6qdd.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]}]
