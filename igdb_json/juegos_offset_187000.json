Others seek to bring popular movies to Half-Life in order to replicate the feeling of the movie in a game. Still others evoke fear and revulsion with a dark, gloomy feel. And then you have mods that make you laugh your ass off. Rocket Crowbar is of the latter type, and one of the best out there right now. If you're looking for wacky fun, Rocket Crowbar delivers. In spades.\n\nRocket Crowbar is basically a weapons modification mod, but the new HL 1.1-compatible version has a couple of extra tricks up its sleeve. First of all, the server can enable a CTF mode on any deathmatch level. All you have to do is make sure teamplay is on and that at least two teams are listed in the server options. Best of all, you can have up to six teams for some really chaotic fun. Secondly, the mod includes the option of a little pregame poll. The person hosting the server just has to edit the appropriate text files in the mod directory and activate the poll via a console command (see below). There is also a very basic bot included, if you're really short on people to kill. All right, you say. Enough with the extra stuff; let's see the weapons!\n\nAll of the Rocket Crowbar weapons have different effects than the standard Half-Life ones. Most notable is the secondary fire on the crowbar, which fires a rocket (and thus, the name of the mod). Weapon balance is taken up a bit in Rocket Crowbar; many weapons are quite lethal. If you're the type who's used to shrugging off a few hits and only trying to dodge shots from big weapons, you're in for a rude awakening. Fortunately, the \"drunken rocket\" effect helps to offset the crowbar as a major weapon. I won't list all of the new effects here, as there is fun to be had in discovering what things do. The Glock has a secondary fire that will push you a little in the direction you're facing. This lets you boost yourself to higher places without the complete mobility provided by the usual grappling hooks, which is a nice balancer. Another example of a highly lethal but fairly balanced weapon is the \"gravity well\" hand grenade. The effect is quite spectacular, but it's easy to get hoist with your own petard when using them. The rocket launcher throws out a friendly NPC, which is actually a very powerful proximity mine. Other effects include the shotgun firing a flying scientist, snarks with eye lasers (and the ability to look through the snarks' eyes) and the tau cannon's teleport effect.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8qcc.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":304221,"name":"A Day for Soft Food","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In A Day for Soft Food the player controls the hungry cat of a household.

However Kate was rich and Leonardo was poor and worse, a thief. Their love was forbidden.\n\nThe game consists of a series of fifty puzzles in which the objective is to get Kate & Leonardo to meet. Kate is usually on top of a parapet or trapped behind a wall shouting 'Help' and the player must guide Leonardo to her. To solve these puzzles Leonardo can climb ladders and, with his mighty fist, he can smash bricks. Smashed bricks disappear and the bricks above them will fall down to take their place. Some bricks are hollow and cannot be smashed, others will explode.\n\nThe game also features teleports, which the manual assures were a common feature on the original Titanic, enemies to deal with, and two lengthy platform sequences where Leonardo must traverse the length of the Titanic.\n\nPasswords are used to enable games to be restarted at later levels.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5u27.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":222814,"name":"Imagynasium","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome to Imagynasium - where art, music and storytelling are combined to give your child's brain a workout.

For the mod 'Arena,' JODI took this principle to the extreme: they completely erased every graphical element of the game, turning monsters, characters and backgrounds all to white. The more psychedelic 'Crl-Space,' the earliest of the set, is not based on a static image. Instead, it features a swirling black-and-white background.

The result is a game space that is loosely architectural and extremely disorienting; it is easy to get lost, and it can be difficult to distinguish the walls from the targets one is supposed to shoot. Paesmans and Heemskerk complement the game-play difficulties with a cryptic interface (setting game preferences is no easy task!) and tongue-in-cheek game instructions along the lines of \"If you are tough, press N.

Players can choose to play a quick match, a non-tour golf game or participate in the real tour. The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.\n\nParticipation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it's necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour.

As with other titles using the Jane's license, the focus of the game is in creating a realistic and believable military aircraft simulation. Hence, the game's controls and mechanics are elaborate, while all controls can be mapped to a voice command. It is also possible to give basic commands to wingmen, if they are present. While waypoints and refueling can be managed by the aircraft's autopilot, all such maneuvers can be done manually. \n \nUSAF is based on 8 different fighters and bombers of the United States Air Force: the F-4E Phantom II, F-105D Thunderchief, A-10A Thunderbolt II, F-15C Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16C Fighting Falcon, F-117A Nighthawk, and the F-22A Raptor. In game modes other than the campaign, the MiG-29 is also available to the player. Each aircraft performs differently and is meant for different tasks, and can be seen from the cockpit (with 2D and 3D views available, and the possibility to look around from the pilot's perspective), from the outside (in a behind view or one of the cinematic views), or with just the HUD visible. \n \nThe game has four campaigns, two of which are historical (Vietnam War and Desert Storm), and the other two (Red Arrow and Sleeping Giant) being fictional and set in a hypothetical future. Tutorials are extensive, while separate tutorials exist under the umbrella term \"Red Flag\", which note more demanding tasks and can not be reached at the lowest rank. The player's progress and rank is recorded in their profile, with each mission's success or failure affecting their score. Scoring itself can be changed by setting various difficulties and \"aids\", with AI help removing score percentages but making the game easier for newcomers. \n \nAside from the campaigns, there are preset single scenarios, as well as a quick mission editor which the player can use to manually set the parameters of a desired air-to-air skirmish (whereas the campaigns have both air-to-ground and air-to-air missions). There is also a Fly Now! button in the main menu, which randomly picks a mission from a small mission pool and puts the player in a random plane. These missions can have the same settings/landscapes as the missions in the campaigns: United States (Nellis Air Force base), Germany, Vietnam, and Iraq. The game comes bundled with a User Mission Editor application as well. USAF has a multiplayer mode available via LAN and JanesCombat.Net (which has since been discontinued). \n \nFinally, the signature feature of Jane's-licensed games is the in-game encyclopaedia, which is present in USAF and lists and describes in detail not only the aircraft the player can pilot or shoot at, but also all other objects that can be encountered in the game, as well as missiles that aircraft can be armed with.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1yim.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":70863,"name":"Puzzle De Bowling","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bowling themed puzzle game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/yhaz2upsujxn0machi9k.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":70681,"name":"Mall Maniacs","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A advertisement game where the player races to pick up groceries faster then everyone else and make it back to the register to win.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4c0h.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":70654,"name":"Thomas & Friends: The Great Festival Adventure","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Thomas and his friends are getting ready for a festival.
