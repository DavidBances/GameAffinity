The world draws its inspiration from history, mythology, and prophecies of the Apocalypse. Most aspects of modern life are now gone. Modern vehicles, weapons, appliances, computer and even the books that describe these things are practically nowhere to be found.\n\nYou are a survivor. Your youth was spent lost in times of war. Your memories of the past with its machines, computers, bright lights and buildings reaching for the skies are vague and ever fading, a distant and unreal dream. You grow accustomed to ancient ways that now once again rule the world.\n\nXsyon is an ever changing dynamic world. Players affect the environment by gathering resources, chopping down trees, hunting animals, building towns and developing trade. Players hold the power to create and destroy, to maintain a balance with nature or to cultivate a new civilization. The game is built around environmental, natural, economic, questing, and social systems. These systems are in constant flux and it's the players interacting with these systems that determine the current state of the virtual world.\n\nXsyon is a fantasy world, but is heavily based on reality. Set in an uncertain apocalyptic future, the virtual world draws upon real life geography, history, science and medicine, fauna and geology are slightly twisted versions of what is real. Whether you are determining what materials to use in a set of armor, trying out ingredient combinations in a recipe or gathering information on the local geography, there is always something new and real you can learn from the Xsyon world.\n\nAs a player, explorer and settler of this new virtual world you have many choices. You can play as a warrior, a trader, a craftsman or a cultivator of crops. You can specialize your skills or become a jack of all trades. You can play as a clan leader or town official, socially involved with many other players, or you can explore the world as a lone adventurer. Xsyon is a game for all kinds of players from casual to hard core. The path you take is up to you.\n\nWhether you are a first day scavenger or a grizzled veteran, Xsyon should be fun. Players begin with a decent set of statistics rather than evolve from a weakling to a super human. You enter the world inexperienced and lacking skill, with strengths and weaknesses, but still as a hero. Rather than grind levels to reach predictable goals, Xsyon is based on change, interactions and consequences. As new quests, lands and features are constantly introduced, there is always something new for you to discover.\n\nBy combining elements of different game genres and social worlds and by blurring the line between fantasy and reality we have created a unique online world. We hope you will find the Xsyon experience fresh, enjoyable, rewarding and full of surprises.\n\nExplore, learn, make friends and create the world you want to live in!

These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived. \n\nFeatures: \n◦ Connect points by numbers or letters \n◦ When points are connected, you will see the silhouette of a hidden picture \n◦ Once all the points have been connected, you can color the picture \n◦ Choosing a wrong symbol three times in a row will bring up a tip \n◦ Blue, orange, green or pink stars make the game even more exciting \n◦ Easy-to-use palette that allows you to put together your own unique set of colors \n◦ Colored pictures automatically saved on closing the program\n\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bcdogqfpcgzx0ppzm0y6.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":82043,"name":"Tadeo Jones y el Manuscrito Perdido","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second game based on the Tadeo Jones franchise.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tiuk2j6rr6zgrxtob1td.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Deep Silver","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":53840,"name":"Tropico 5: Waterborne","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Harness the vast potential of the sea by constructing waterborne structures around your island.

The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2hr6.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"BlankMediaGames","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":8756,"name":"NEO Scavenger","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"NEO Scavenger is a game where you must survive in the wasteland long enough to figure out who you are.
