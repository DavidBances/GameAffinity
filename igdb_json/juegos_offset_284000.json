Findhill remained alone, in a small town surrounded by vicious monsters. He wants to become a hunter, just like his father once was, to get rid of the monsters roaming the wilderness, and get to the bottom of his father's disappearance and his mysterious project.\n\nThe game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG: Findhill and his companions, who join the party as dictated by the course of the story, wander around a vast world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective. The party can carry different types of weapons, including various guns (rifles, shotguns, etc.) with expendable bullets. Weapons and armor are shared by all the characters and need not be equipped on individual combatants. The player can also purchase robotic fighters (called \"Metals\" in the game) in shops, who would then join the party and participate in battles, controlled by the AI. There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8hyj.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ELF","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":308247,"name":"Metal Eye 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Metal Eye 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe and is closely related story-wise to the first game. In the future, people have built the floating city Zeron, where the best scientists work on creating androids, artificial human beings who look the same way as real ones. Harvest Corporation is the biggest company that creates androids. The hero of the game is a scientist named Wirg, the father of the first game's protagonist. His work is to train the androids after they have been created. One day, the company building is attacked, and Wirg has to escape. He is saved by a nun and brought into a small town in the middle of wasteland, where his adventure begins.\n\nThe game mostly follows a traditional Japanese RPG template: Wirg and his companions (a party of three) explore the top-down world and fight random enemies in turn-based combat in first-person view. The pictures of enemies appear super-imposed on whatever location the characters are currently in, without separate battle screens. The towns have isometric perspective. Like its predecessor, the game has a large world map that consists of many separate screens, often including dungeon-like locations.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8hyk.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ELF","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"}]},{"id":308248,"name":"Yami no Koe II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sayoko sends K off the island to a secluded private academy, where she makes an ally of the principal and begins to influence the students and faculty, slowly degenerating the entire school.

A commercialized version released as \"Metajo\" was released a year later with many mechanic and graphic improvements as well as story alterations such as allowing players to experience the 1200-year establishment until the end.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8i3m.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"R-Force Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":308288,"name":"Reines Du Sabbat","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Reines Du Sabbat is a JRPG developed by doujin circle Kenix who would later develop Corpse Party, this work became quite infamous on the Japanese internet during the late 90's and early 2000's due to its grotesque content to the point of being \"quietly\" distributed on freeware sites.\n\nThe game takes place in the country of Serfina.

However, one day, Lux suddenly fell ill with a fever of an unknown origin, with no doctor able to help and him gradually losing his strength. Puff heard about a medicinal herb called the Snow Herb that can quickly bring down any kind of fever and went to the forest of Pia to find it.

Stage layouts are slightly different, and the decision to use sprites similar in size to the arcade version means that fewer enemies can appear on screen at any one time. Sprite flicker is a common sight, and entire sections of stages are removed to save space. Unlike the arcade version, players cannot backtrack during either side-scrolling or boss sections, limiting player to a very small section of the screen during the boss fights.\n\nThe most striking omission in the Master System version of Shadow Dancer is the dog as an active character, but it is still available as a game mechanic. When a valid target is onscreen, the player must crouch. While crouched, the ninja magic icon will slowly transform into a a dog head. When the icon is completely full, it will move to the target enemy's location. Pressing attack will cause the dog to appear out of nowhere and attack the enemy. If no valid target exists, the icon will not move and pressing attack while crouched will perform a normal attack. The dog can be called only three times each stage.\n\nThe Master System version retains the first-person shuriken-throwing bonus rounds, but the one between the second and third stage is the same bonus round used by the Mega Drive version, which makes player to jump from a tall building and attack ninjas in a downward shoot-'em-up fashion.\n\nLike the Master System version of Shinobi, ninja magic cannot be used during boss fights. In addition to the previously mentioned problem of being confined to a small section of the screen, this makes the boss fights even more difficult than the arcade version.\n\nA small oddity, in the Master System version, Shinobi always bows to the boss before the battle.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8szm.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sanritsu Denki Co., Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tec Toy","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"}]},{"id":308421,"name":"The Experimental Turnabout","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Phoenix, Maya, and Edgeworth awake in a courtroom that seems normal at first, but is in fact one located within a virtual reality created by an individual known only as the Game Master, who insists that this will be a 'history-making experiment'.
