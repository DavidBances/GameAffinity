Magical Drop Plus 1! was released in North America and Europe as \"Chain Reaction\"; in this version, the puzzle pieces are changed from spherical Drops to various items (such as food or celestial bodies) and the character-unique voice acting is replaced by a single male narrator.\n\nAll versions of the original arcade game were developed for Data East's \"MLC\" arcade hardware.\n\nThe game includes two game modes: the one-player score-based Solo Play (where additional lines of tiles regularly drop from the top of the screen) and two-player competitive Battle Mode (where the second player can be human or CPU opponents). Similar to Tetris Attack, players can make \"chain reactions\" by quickly creating near-simultaneous matches to either boost their score (in Solo Play) or fill up more of their opponent's playfield (in Battle Mode).\n\nMagical Drop was ported to the Super Famicom, which includes a puzzle mode that challenges players to solve preset puzzles given a limited number of possible moves. The game was re-imagined for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn with different, pre-rendered characters. The Sega Saturn port was going to be released in America by Koei, and appeared at E3 1997, however the American release was cancelled. Finally, a port of the game is part of Magical Drop III + Wonderful; this includes the PAL version of III + Wonderful, which retains the Magical Drop Plus 1! name as opposed to using Chain Reaction.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co70q1.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Russ, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HAMSTER","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"D4 Enterprise","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MonkeyPaw Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"G-MODE Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Data East","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Data East","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":13476,"name":"Challenge of the Gobots","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ariolasoft produced this game based on the then-sort-of-popular cartoon series, Gobots.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zjf4bep4j6uetkxi4izo.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Reaktör Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":13477,"name":"Championship Jet Ski Simulator","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ayxqdwrcfvtysi4enj8g.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Codemasters","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":13478,"name":"Championship Sprint","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Championship Sprint is an arcade game that was released in 1986 and was the sequel to Super Sprint","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co60ci.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electric Dreams Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atari Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atari Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":13479,"name":"Championship Water-Skiing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xupj3f8mcf1juvxpaocn.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Infogrames","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":13480,"name":"Charlie Chaplin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Charlie Chaplin, an action platformer, is your chance to become a movie director and produce the greatest comedies starring Charlie Chaplin.

If an aircraft is attacking then the game has you controlling a gun to shoot down the planes viewed from a 1st person perspective. You can move the gun left or right and move it up or down to hit the planes before they drop bombs on your ship. This screen is also used for any missile attack. \n \nIf any convoy's of ships are attacking then you must fire a missile at the convoy by first lining up a sight that keeps moving while a timer counts down.

Enemies are invisible, and location is only possible through the use of sound, with notes of different pitch helping the player find the distance and direction of enemies. Additionally, every gun in the game must be charged up immediately before each shot, and charging a shot for too long will cause the charge to dissipate, after which the charging must start over. Since all available guns have very limited range, this makes timing crucial; beginning to charge the gun too late or too soon will allow the enemy to reach Laura, resulting in an immediate game over.\n\nIn Enemy Zero, reloading the gun and moving the character around are mechanics that have been made intentionally slow,[4] which stimulates players to avoid combat and direct contact with the alien enemies as much as possible. In the early segments of the game, avoiding detection is not only recommended; it is required, since the player has no means to defend him or herself without a gun. Enemy Zero is an example of a game containing stealth elements[5] roughly two years before the release of Metal Gear Solid popularized the genre worldwide, though ten years after Metal Gear started the genre in 1987.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2g3b.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"WARP","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":13550,"name":"Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax Ignition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax Ignition is a Japanese fighting game based on various Dengeki Bunko light novel properties and an updated version of the original Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax.

Herbert (their baby son) also appeared in the game as a mobile hazard NPC. The player cannot freely change character; the player begins in control of Wally and in order to switch must be on the same screen as the desired character. Those not being controlled by the player wander randomly around the map controlled by extremely simple AI - another feature that at the time had never been seen before. Lives and health (called \"endurance\") were tracked independently for each character, but the game ended if any character died.\n\nThe aim of the game is to complete a day's worth of work for each character; each character has a job to do stereotypical of their skill - for instance, Wally has to build a wall, Wilma has to take back three books to the library, etc. Completing the job awards the character with a letter, which spells out a password to open a safe holding everyone's wages. The eventual password is \"BREAK\" - knowing this does not spoil the game since most of the letters can be seen before jobs are complete; the game requires them to be actually collected before allowing the safe to open.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/u8fjj0erycka2dumw1os.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mikro-Gen Ltd","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":13650,"name":"Execution","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13651,"name":"The Experience","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13652,"name":"Exploding Wall","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13653,"name":"Explorer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/m1abiqay12wn3cgfynom.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"The RamJam Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electric Dreams Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13654,"name":"Express Raider","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Express Raider was produced by Data East in 1986.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8hs6.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"U.S. Gold","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Data East","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Data East","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":13655,"name":"Extreme","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Extreme is a fast-paced action game for the ZX Spectrum that pits players against alien pirates across three diverse environments.

The larger ships have cloaking devices which make them invisible. Damage is inflicted on ships when they are shot or rammed by other ships.\n\nUniquely for the time, the player vessel remains locked in the centre of the screen and the world rotates and moves around it. Player shots also have limited range and are subject to the same rotation as everything else, which means the player needs to predict where shots will need to go in order to hit the enemies. The ship has both long range scanners and shields but may only use one at a time. By default, the game will automatically switch between them based on the proximity of enemy vessels but the player can optionally take full control.\n\nUsing shields, thrusting, turning and firing all use up energy which is also depleted when hit by enemies. Energy will automatically replenish, most quickly if the shields are off and the starship is not moving, but this leaves the player open to attack.\n\nUnusually, the player is never expected to return their ship from the frontiers. Each individual voyage is a separate command, and lasts either until the player's vessel is destroyed or until they use an escape capsule. If the escape capsule is successfully launched, which means firing it so that it doesn't collide with any enemy ships, and the player is judged by Star-Fleet to have killed enough enemies during his command then he is given a new commission and a new and visually different ship. 8 points are scored for a small ship and 12 for a large ship. Starfleet's opinion of the player's performance ranges from them being \"furious\" to \"delighted\". The number of points required to reach the next level is not fixed.

Find the tomb and you will stand to be the sole beneficiary to Primm’s estate. The only information that you have to go by is Primm’s unpublished paper on the legend of Ahnk-Ahnk and his African diary.\n\nThe quest begins near a large port town and here you can find stores which will allow you to purchase items which are necessary like ropes and shovels. You start the quest with only $250. Use the map provided to find important landmarks and locations which the natives may name when giving you directions. The natives hold the key to your success. Not all natives behave the same to strangers. Offer them gold, copper, or other gifts to win their friendship. But be careful, not all natives see your offering as a sign of friendship. They each have their own cultures. Presenting them with the wrong gift may hinder your attempts to get needed information.\n\nUse the joystick to move about, press the fire button when you are standing still to move control to the four icons to the left of the exploration window. Click these icons for further options. The diary icon lets you page through your diary to review the clues that you get from the native chiefs. The map icon lets you see what you have explored so far. The options icon offers three choices. Two let you check on your location and condition. The third lets you drop things off to form a cache. The hand icon lets you select what you have in your hand and it lets you use items from your backpack. If you are delirious, your joystick control will become uncertain, reversed or randomized.\n\nGo to a pub in a port city to save your game. You can save up to 10 different games at once on a single disk.

A key strategic element to the game is for the player character to travel several screens ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path for it; normally this would be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion. However, if the bomb is left in an unsafe location, it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once.

Predecessor to Ragnarok Online with interesting characters and world and combat system similar to Grandia.\n\nArcturus is a Korean-made role-playing game in Japanese style, similar to Grandia II in visual presentation. The player can choose between two prologues chapters (either Elluard's or Sizz's), after which the two stories converge. There is no overworld in the game, and areas are interconnected. Battles take place in the same environment as exploration, and are turn-based. The player can navigate characters on the battle field and also take their speed rankings into account, as executions of attacks and other moves depends on them.\n\nMagic can be learned by certain characters and is divided into four elements: Water, Air, Earth, and Fire. Casting spells requires a certain amount of real time when in combat. Characters learn new spells by repeatedly using available ones in the correspondent category. Those who do not have access to magic can execute various special attacks with their own separate point gauges. In addition to HP, characters also have \"barrier points\", which are reduced first when enemies damage them.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co28mi.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Wizard Soft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"GRAVITY","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sonnori","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nihon Falcom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":13959,"name":"Astro Blaster","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player controls a ship (bearing a resemblance to the Battlestar Galactica) which can fire and move left or right.

The player must battle through waves of enemies, which attack with varied formations and flight patterns. When a wave is destroyed, a new one appears. At the end of each sector, the player flies through an asteroid belt and can obtain extra fuel by shooting fireballs. After this, the mother ship is met, where the player docks and refuels for the next sector. Also, the player is rewarded various bonuses for accomplishing certain feats, such as, shooting all enemies in a specific order or shooting all enemies without missing.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3wkk.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega/Gremlin","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Quicksilva Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gremlin Industries","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":13960,"name":"Auf Wiedersehen Pet","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"}]},{"id":13961,"name":"Ballooning","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":13962,"name":"Bananaby","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":13963,"name":"Battle 1917","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"}]},{"id":13964,"name":"Beaky and the Egg Snatchers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Andromedan Armed Condors like to lay their eggs on the planet Crackit.
