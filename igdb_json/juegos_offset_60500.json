Well, maybe not every; but in Japan, this seems to be a rather popular theme. Mysterious disappearances, ghostly photographs, untimely deaths, eerie sounds coming out of the music room - all these things attract the curiosity of three high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. At night, armed with nothing but a flashlight, the trio of heroines enters the dark school building, prepared to explore every corner, and investigate every urban legend they have heard of...\n\nTansaku-hen opens the Twilight Syndrome horror adventure series, defining its stylistic traits and gameplay. The game is divided into chapters, each dedicated to a particular \"ghostly\" story. Unlike most Japanese-style adventures, there is physical character navigation in the game; the player moves digitized images of the three girls on 2D backgrounds, in a manner somewhat similar to side-scrolling games - though many areas feature a third dimension, like in Western third-person perspective adventures.\n\nThe gameplay consists of two activities only: walking and occasionally choosing a dialogue option and/or action, as prompted by the game's narrative. There is no other kind of interaction, no inventory, and no combat. Different choices may lead to different endings; the next chapter can be accessed only if the player has not attained the \"bad\" ending.\n\nTwilight Syndrome: Tansaku-hen abandons the nearly omnipresent anime/manga graphical style of Japanese games in favor of digitized images and photos of real people.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wb3.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Human Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":65453,"name":"Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Masou Kishin II - Revelation of Evil God","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Masou Kishin II is the sequel to the Super Famicom game Super Robot Wars Gaiden.

Suddenly, real ghosts appear and scare the teenagers away. The next day, Yuri is almost ready to believe it was all a dream... but naturally it wasn't. The dark secrets of the lost souls are going to be revealed only to those which possess a special sense - the Twilight Syndrome..\n\nThe third entry in the Twilight Syndrome series is also a horror adventure, sharing most gameplay elements with its predecessors. The gameplay here is very minimalistic: the player can navigate the 3D models of the heroes (several characters can be controlled at once, as a group) through the limited areas (also rendered in 3D), searching for clues and escaping from danger. There is no other interaction, no usable items, and no combat.\n\nDialogue and action choices will pop out during many situations. Some of these choices do not influence the narrative, while others might change the following dialogue, and also lead the young heroes to premature death.\n\nAn additional gameplay mode (beside the story mode) is free-roaming exploration for Yuri, who can explore the school and its surroundings at night and gather more stories from the ghosts she encounters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3b2o.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Vaill","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Spike","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":65457,"name":"Chobits: Chii Dake no Hito","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Playstation 2 game based on the manga and anime series Chobits.\n\nStory centers on a 17 year old guy by the name of Hideki Motosuwa, he resides in an alternate universe of sorts thats filled with things known as Persocom's, a Persocom simply put is a Personal Computer.

The game takes place over five aerial stages where the goal is to survive for five minutes (stage 4) or defeat all enemies (all other stages). In normal mode stages unlock sequentially, and each stage has a set vehicle and co-pilot. Upon completing normal mode hard mode stages are unlocked, which have hardier and more aggressive enemies as well as the ability to use all vehicles, pilots, optional gear, and co-pilots in the game. The player can also toggle flight controls between Normal, where the Valkyrie jet mode moves similarly to its bipedal modes, or Real, where the jet can bank and spin like an actual aircraft. In combat Valkyries and the Large Varja units can shift between their different forms by tapping a direction on the right stick. The Queadluun-Rhea does not have alternate forms, but can still change between high speed and maneuverability modes. Units will have a primary weapon (typically a rifle), and a secondary weapon (typically missiles), a melee attack, and speed boost. Weapons have unlimited ammunition, but limited magazines, and must be reloaded when depleted. All units can dash in a direction to break missile locks by double tapping, and shoot down missiles automatically with the missile defense move as long as they have remaining Anti gauge. A Special bar is replenished by gaining sequential hits on targets, and can be expended to increase boost, turn melee into a charging tackle, unleash the vehicle's unique ultimate attack, or activate the co-pilot's special ability.
