In the company of a variety of unlikely allies with their own pasts and agendas, Alushe’s strong desire to save Liliana gives her the strength to scatter the shadows shrouding the world and motivation to uncover the shocking truth behind the mysterious Queen of the Moon.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1rcm.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gust","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Koei Tecmo Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":11364,"name":"Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Enter the Chaos-infested Caligari Sector and purge the unclean with the most powerful agents of the Imperium of Man.\nWarhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr is a grim Action-RPG featuring multiple classes of the Inquisition who will carry out the Emperor' will in the darkest reaches of the Imperium!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co24kj.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NeoCore Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bigben Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"}]},{"id":306207,"name":"Pretend You're Xyzzy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Cards Against Humanity Clone","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":202829,"name":"Golden Axe Classics","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A bundle containing mobile ports of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive versions of main Golden Axe trilogy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5y7r.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":202358,"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duelingbook","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Duelingbook is a Yu-Gi-Oh!

Obviously not a WAD for everyone, the core target for such a mod is mainly people who are in video game glitches, corruptions and to some extent, creepypastas (whether that love is ironic or not). Nothing works as it is supposed to. You can hardly understand most of the things that are happening to you. Some of the custom monsters (like the hitscanning corrupted pinky) will put you on edge and keep you paranoid about the ruleset of the game.\n\nThe aesthetic of lilith.pk3 is one of a kind, horribly mangling the rendering engine of old ZDoom beyond belief to disform sprites, textures, text and even sound effects. The end result makes close to no sense, your Doom marine sprite is heavily dislocated and looks more like one of those creatures from Alien than a human being and the list goes on and on. The confused looks obviously doesn't always make for clean or concise gameplay, especially in later levels which crank the confusion up to eleven and manipulate the level geometry to do things you thought weren't possible in the game. Even basic things like crushers, slime pits or a turnstile look horribly out of shape and makes the player uncomfortable.\n\nThis is essentially what lilith boils down to: an unfamilarity to something we thought we knew by heart, a rising sense of uncomfort as the level design makes less and less sense and offering the player a new perspective on what Doom is. Don't play lilith expecting top-notch Doom gameplay, but play it for the one of a kind experience it offers you. For the better and for the worse, there are no WADs like lilith anywhere and there will never be.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5twu.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"anotak","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":87033,"name":"Land Snake.io","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Land Snake is a new exciting and challenging IO game with smooth controls.
