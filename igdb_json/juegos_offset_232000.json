Yes, yes, the same one that created and released the well-known Farm Frenzy and the Treasures of Montezuma.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. We control a green dragon (and in the game mode for two - also blue), which shoots green bubbles at enemies, and as soon as the enemies hit them, they immediately find themselves in a trap, and we calmly pop these bubbles as a dragon. And from the enemies we get their leftovers in the form of various kinds of food: from fruits to a mug of beer, which also appear as a randomly appearing bonus. There are only 8 enemies - these are clockwork toys familiar to us from the original, and weirdos in a white cloak, and brown ghosts similar to octopuses, and flying monsters with a propeller, and jumpers, and fluffy monsters, and sorcerers, and spiders. If clockwork toys, propeller monsters and octopuses are not particularly dangerous, and they can be easily killed, then here are the rest to be wary of. You should especially be wary of types in white robes and sorcerers who, when they meet you, launch fireballs at you. Sometimes there are several of them at the levels. In some levels, it happens that the monsters are in a small room of platforms, the path to which either leads to a trap or does not exist at all. Then bubbles with lightning come to the rescue, with the help of which you can instantly kill enemies. And if there is open space at the same time, then you can use bubbles with water, crushing enemies when interacting with the player, and with fire, leaving behind traps that kill enemies in the form of a fire floor.\n\nAt levels, bubbles with letters appear from time to time, with which you can make a word and teleport to an empty room without enemies, where you will receive prizes in the form of bonuses and an increase in a unit of health.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6jq3.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Alawar Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"GameOver-Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":251021,"name":"Tetris E60","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tetris E60 is web game released to promote the movie Tetris.
