Unlock the ‘Ultra’ phase, accessed by playing perfect shots in a row, and multiply your points while avoiding the decaying table. For Insanity, this is where it gets insane! The table changes continually, the clock's counting down and the pressure is on to get the highest score possible. All players will be able to track their progress on a global Leaderboard.
