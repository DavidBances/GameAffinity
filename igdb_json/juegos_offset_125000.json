As second in command to the Godfather, YOU will be the one to carry out the Corleones’ dirty deeds and fight for the honor and respect of the most powerful Family in New York City.\n\nBuilding a legacy won’t be a simple undertaking. As your wealth and influence grow, unfortunately, so does your list of dedicated enemies. Keep a watchful eye over your empire, as even a trusted ally could turn against you. When hostilities arise, you will have to use strength, intimidation, and intelligence to protect your assets, as well as your honor.

Once you take control of your domain, you must find lucrative ways to enhance your resources and increase your wealth. Blood is a big expense, but if necessary, be ready to engage in deadly warfare. Remember to keep your friends close and your enemies closer— you never know who will use your information for their own personal gains.\n\nCan you maintain your loyalty to The Godfather?

The protagonists will form teams in order to fight through Chaos' armies and find their crystals which will later be used to destroy Chaos. Each character has his own campaign to go through at the end of which a crystal will be collected.\n\nThe game also features a single fight and an arcade mode where the player will be able to choose his fighter and the opponent (opponents are automatically chosen by the game if playing in arcade mode though). All of the character's experience and skills received through the campaign are saved for the other game modes (and vice-versa, for example: if Cloud had a level equal to 12 when completing the campaign, he will also appear to have the same level when viewing him in the character roster in Arcade or Quick Battle mode).\n\nAnother feature is that the items you find during the campaign belong to you, the player. That means you can move items from a character to another. The game also features extra content such as villains, costumes etc. which can be unlocked by using PP.

You will follow Trump and his allies as they cheat and lie their ways to win seven key battleground states. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is a work of fiction, approximately 70% of the game content is based on actual events and quotes during and following Trump's campaign, including sound clips of Trump's most controversial speeches\r\n\r\nUsing humor, Trump: Agent of Hate explores serious issues in an increasingly divided American society, including wealth inequality, racism, fear of terrorism, fake news, conflict of interest in government, LGBT rights, abortion, sexism, climate change denial and police brutality. It pokes fun at politicians who, instead of standing up against hate, are often far too willing to zig zag their ways to personal gains.\r\nOn a lighter note, Trump: Agent of Hate also includes some mindless humor with references to pop culture phenomena over the past two years.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the satire and dark humor, the game delivers an overarching positive message towards solidarity against the rise of hate. It portrays Trump supporters as victims of Trump's con man scheme as much as the rest of us.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27ur.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":25012,"name":"Snowman","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Santa Claus lost his presents.
