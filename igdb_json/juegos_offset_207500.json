After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.\n\nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\n\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ahfjuff8s6xnvchb2gfc.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":42122,"name":"Keith Courage in Alpha Zones","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Now the Battle is in Your Hands.\n\nYou are Keith Courage.

Alice can shoot bubbles, technically termed \"shabon balls\", at the enemy in an effort to knock them off of the floating terrain or destroy them. Holding down the attack button will charge the bubble and make it larger, resulting in greater knockback strength or simply more damage, depending on the enemy.\n\nThe enemies are also trying to knock Alice off, too. In fact, Alice does not take damage in a conventional sense: the only way to lose a life is to fall in to the void. Alice comes equipped with several balloons which can rescue her from a fall should one occur. Alice is capable of jumping to avoid obstacles or shots from enemies, or to jump over gaps in the terrain. At the end of each stage is a boss; Alice has a 180 second time limit to get to the end and defeat the boss or else \"time over\" monsters will appear and attack her.

Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. Power Ups are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss. Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread show with the power ups, plus missiles which drops like bombs as auxiliary fire. The robot mode has a frontal laser gun which increases in power with the power ups plus homing missiles as auxiliary fire. An interesting element of the game is represented by the hidden bonuses (usually 1UP) which can be revealed by shooting certain parts of the scenario or by continuously hitting certain indestructible enemies.

There even is a day/night change hinted at through pallette rotation of the mostly monocoloured background. The game has a time limit, but rather than just killing the player off when it runs out, more and more evil suns come attacking the player already when only little time is left. \n \nThe game can be enjoyed by two players simultaneously, who can use each other's head as a springboard to reach higher places without relying on nearby enemies. Only in the second half the game tends to get a bit tedious, as there's almost no new elements introduced after the middle, and those from the early stages grow old fast because of their steady repetition.

Play is for one or two players simultaneously (including a battle-mode), and options are available for mouse and joystick controls. A comprehensive level editor is also included. The players’ bat here is made out to look like a bone, and the ball is a spherical stone. Level backdrops are randomised pixel-painted scenes featuring different types of Dinosaurs. The bricks to knock out sometimes contain pickups to collect, such as a laser gun, an automatic CPU controlled bat navigation mode, extra life, slow-ball etc. A pickup is immediately activated upon collection, but subsequent ones collected are not if one is active, and clicking the right mouse button will cancel out the current effect for the last pickup collected. A bonus coconut game can be enabled from the main menu, which in turn lets you play this sub-game at predefined intervals during the course of standard play, where you control a caveman holding a pan, and the object is to catch coconuts that fall from trees with it, by moving from left to right on the single screen. Your bonus is tallied for how many coconuts you managed to catch in the allotted time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8y7d.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":46843,"name":"Full Throttle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A driving game very similar to \"Out Run\", except for the addition of the nitro boost button.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ydfbgii6zcohmvb161wp.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":46241,"name":"Atomic Runner","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player takes the role of Chelnov, a coal miner who miraculously survives the malfunction and explosion of a nuclear power plant.
