However, with the release of the Nintendo 64 looming close, Nintendo decided to cancel the game despite it being nearly complete. Many features of this game were later reused in Star Fox 64, most notably Star Wolf, and the game itself was later leaked as source code and compiled into a working ROM.\nThe game was later released for the SNES Classic console as an unlockable game, marking its first official release. Since then, the game was also released for the Nintendo Switch Online service.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1u6b.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Argonaut Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":9061,"name":"Cuphead","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles.

The game follows the stories of Blazing Sword’s cast between the end of Blazing Sword and the beginning of its Japanese-only follow-up, Fire Emblem: Binding Blade. It was originally inspired by the BSFE games, and Arch’s personal reading of 1001 Arabian Nights (hence the title).\n\nThe story centers around several different “tales,” which are are similar to a standard Fire Emblem chapter. The main difference, however, is that each tale is completely independent. The cast of the first tale will not carry over into the second, and while some do link together (for example, Tales 1, 2, and 3 provide the backdrop for Tale 5’s events), the plots are independent of each other. At the center of the game is a hub, the “Tale Select,” which also grants access to view Achievements, Bonus Content, toggle the difficulty settings, and, of course, choose a tale to play/replay.\n\nThe classic Fire Emblem elements are all intact. Each unit has a personality and a story which contributes their unique characteristics to the overall tale. Although unit deaths are not permanent (if a unit dies in a tale, when you replay that tale the character will return), the tactical choices you make have an effect on the outcome of the stories. All of Blazing Sword’s surviving playable cast (and some of its non-playable cast) make an appearance, with some guest appearances by Binding Blade and Immortal Sword characters.\n\nElibean Nights features a total of 16 playable maps, 19 achievements, and plenty of new story content. The final standard chapter was completed in 2014, but development of additional bonus features continued until final cancellation in 2019.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ckt.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Arch","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":131106,"name":"Sky Jump","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sky Jump is a gorgeous, addictive game that will keep the player entertained for hours.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co41m7.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Game for people","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Easy game","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":75831,"name":"The Balloonist: Beyond the Clouds","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Imagine a Balloon that you Build yourself.
