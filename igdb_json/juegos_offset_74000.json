Cat have probably never heard of Tom & Jerry, but they’re just as single-minded: any means to hurt the adversary is a good one. They get plenty of means in Incredible Toons. Around 100 puzzles need to be solved, each one a 2D machine of which crucial parts are missing. The player's task is to choose useful objects from a separate window, position them on the screen and start the machine to see if it’s working. A simple example: a piano hanging from a rope needs to be dropped on Al. To accomplish this, you place open scissors next to the cable and drop a ball on them - voila, the rope is cut, Al crushed. However, most puzzles are far more complicated; for example, the player might first have to lure Al under the piano with a fish, which needs to be transported to the right location by conveyor belts. \n \nThe puzzles involve a score of contraptions, ranging from simple ropes and pulleys to balloons, trapdoors, catapults, bombs, electrical hairdryers, and motors. Sid and Al are accompanied by several other cartoon characters, such as the lady elephant Eunice who will toss things around, or the pet dragon Bik that ignites objects with his fiery breath. \n \nGameplay is spiced up with cartoon animations -- Al chasing Sid is a sight to remember. If the player has solved all of the puzzles, the player can build own challenges with the comfortable editor. Oh, be sure to learn Sid & Al’s lessons well -- you never know when you need to get rid of a mouse with nothing but some cheese, a trapdoor and an anvil.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1lwg.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Dynamix, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":80153,"name":"CityVille","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Facebook Browser game made by Zynga.

However, the heroes were unable to reach the core, and were forced to engage their alternate plan - detonate the bomb at the wormhole in hope of closing it.\n\nWhen they came to, they found they had crashed landed on Earth, more specifically in China of the year 241 BC, right in the middle of a battle where five kingdoms have united to challenge the dominant Qin nation. Upon seeing the survivors in their mecha suits, they regarded them as gods, and fled in fear. The twelve people from the future have turned into the Great Qin Warriors, helping the ruler of the country to conquer the entire China, found the Qin dynasty, and become the First Emperor. But the price to pay for this glory is too high - the twelve heroes must find a way to return to their own time and save the Earth.\n\nGreat Qin Warriors is a mecha-type first-person shooter. The single-player mode is mission-based; the player selects available missions, which take him to various exotic locations of different regions and time periods.

Once upon a time the Japanese priest Enno has fought and defeated the demon lord Zenki. Zenki was sealed for centuries in the magical bracelet that the Enno family carried through generations. But now, in modern-day Japan, demons called Seeds of Karuma, who worship an ancient evil goddess, began to appear on the Earth, bringing death and destruction. Enno's descendant, a lovely young girl named Chiaki, has no choice but to use her bracelet to summon Zenki! But while being sealed, Zenki has reverted to the form of a nasty, greedy little boy. Chiaki must evoke the power of bracelet to make Zenki fight on her side, and destroy the demons!\n\nVajra Fight is what is commonly called a beat-em-up game, similar to games like Final Fight and others. Controlling either Zenki or Chiaki (or both in two player mode), the player must typically eliminate a number of enemies on a screen until he/she is allowed to proceed. Zenki fights melee-style, while Chiaki uses ranged energy balls; she can also summon Zenki with the bracelet power-up to inflict massive damage. Zenki and Chiaki can also execute various special attacks, which can be mapped to the controller for quicker access. There are many boss fights in the game, some stages consisting of one large-scale boss battle.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/r17cyw82ic7wvu7csq95.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-FX"}]},{"id":80298,"name":"Flipper","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The hero of the game is a courageous young boy and you must lead him through various worlds full of obstacles to retrieve his stolen goldfish called Flipper!\n\nThe game features beautiful pixel-art backdrops, cheerful cartoon characters and catchy music.
