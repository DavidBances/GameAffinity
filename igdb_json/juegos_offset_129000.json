Fuchsia uses its unique music and art style to create an atmosphere not only of mystery and intrigue, but also of hilarity and absurdity. \n \nThe game's puzzles, just like the atmosphere, exude uniqueness. While they will, no doubt, at times leave the player thinking long and hard, the puzzles are always fair and sensible. They are easy enough for any player to be capable of solving them with enough time, yet difficult enough for every player to feel satisfied at every point of progression. \n \nFuchsia takes place in three distinct sections (or \"chapters\"), and takes approximately one to two hours to complete. Completion time will, of course, vary based on how long the player takes to solve each puzzle. \n \nThis is our first game ever, so we really hope you enjoy it!
