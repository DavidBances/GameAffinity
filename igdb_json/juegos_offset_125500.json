The game follows the stories of Blazing Sword’s cast between the end of Blazing Sword and the beginning of its Japanese-only follow-up, Fire Emblem: Binding Blade. It was originally inspired by the BSFE games, and Arch’s personal reading of 1001 Arabian Nights (hence the title).\n\nThe story centers around several different “tales,” which are are similar to a standard Fire Emblem chapter. The main difference, however, is that each tale is completely independent. The cast of the first tale will not carry over into the second, and while some do link together (for example, Tales 1, 2, and 3 provide the backdrop for Tale 5’s events), the plots are independent of each other. At the center of the game is a hub, the “Tale Select,” which also grants access to view Achievements, Bonus Content, toggle the difficulty settings, and, of course, choose a tale to play/replay.\n\nThe classic Fire Emblem elements are all intact. Each unit has a personality and a story which contributes their unique characteristics to the overall tale. Although unit deaths are not permanent (if a unit dies in a tale, when you replay that tale the character will return), the tactical choices you make have an effect on the outcome of the stories. All of Blazing Sword’s surviving playable cast (and some of its non-playable cast) make an appearance, with some guest appearances by Binding Blade and Immortal Sword characters.\n\nElibean Nights features a total of 16 playable maps, 19 achievements, and plenty of new story content. The final standard chapter was completed in 2014, but development of additional bonus features continued until final cancellation in 2019.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ckt.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Arch","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":135719,"name":"Please adopt me. # AI needs repair.","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The AI system has failed for unknown reasons.

The basic stats of the player's mech, e.g. armor or the boost speed, are determined by the chosen pilot character and the used mech components which can be changed for arms, legs, chassis, head, booster and weapon load-out. All those components have strengths, weaknesses and weight, the latter being the restricting factor. \n \nThe game also has a single-player mode, skirmish, which consists of playing multiplayer matches against bots.

A second player can now join in anytime via the use of a Game Link Cable, taking control of Billy's brother, Jimmy.\n\nThe combat system is simpler compared to previous Double Dragon games, including the first Game Boy game. The player can perform a series of punches or a kick on most enemies, followed by straight punch or a high kick that knocks the enemy to the floor. Pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously will cause the player to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform an aerial uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly punch his opponent in the face or push them to the ground. While standing near a fallen enemy, a jumping knee drop can be performed. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other games in the series.\n\nThe game is composed of three missions, spread across ten stages. The first two missions each consist of four stages that follows a basic structure: the player fight their way through a street until reaching the boss. This is followed by a subway platform, a fight inside a subway car, and the destination platform, where the player confronts another boss. The final mission, composed of only two stages, starts at the streets again, but this time the player must fight his way to the entrance of the Scorpions headquarters. Once inside the building, the player fight their way through a series of floors, including an area where all the previous bosses appear, until reaching the top floor where Anderson awaits. The game has three difficulty settings, but the Easy setting only allows the first mission to be played.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co986a.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Acclaim Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Technos Japan","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":136135,"name":"Schism","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Schism is a short action-platformer, made to be a short fun burst of a game with a bit of challenge.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e4c.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Volpanic!","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":136136,"name":"Roaring Streets","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A hardboiled noir detective shoots his inner demons away...
