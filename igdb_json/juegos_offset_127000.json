Thus far 523 songs have been remade and 152 songs still waiting to be recreated in the new engine. 91 new songs has also been added to the game for a total of 614 songs.\n\nThe game focuses on a new \"Reflesia Mode\" as its main component. Where you are challenged to different quests (random selection of songs) where the opponent has a set health bar. Deplete the health bar by playing well and you will progress the story and unlock songs, as well as characters and items. These characters and items can be levelled up and equipped to be more powerful and deplete the health bar of your opponent quicker.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jef.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami Amusement","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":136183,"name":"Call of Duty: Black Ops Collection","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This Bundle contains:\n\n- Call of Duty: Black Ops\n- Call of Duty: Black Ops II\n- Call of Duty: Black Ops III","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3asf.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Treyarch","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":125794,"name":"Len'en Ten'eisenki: Brilliant Pagoda or Haze Castle","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6en7.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":109989,"name":"Wooparoopang","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A mobile match 3 puzzle game that got shut down on the 13th of December 2017.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4eb1.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":102452,"name":"We're Going on a Bear Hunt","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Play as either Rosie or Max as you swish through the grass, splash through the river and squelch through the mud on the children's exciting search of a bear.

At the start of the game an armistice is proposed as well as a union of states through the marriage of Prince Noctis of Lucis and Lady Lunafreya of Tenebrae, a separate nation with limited political power due to the influence of a priestess called the Oracle. The game opens when Noctis, the only playable character, travels with his friends Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto to Accordo where the wedding is to take place. Along the way it is revealed Niflheim has betrayed Lucis and the crystal has been stolen with many important figures killed.

This does not go as expected. Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary School, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of survival - much less escape - is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them. Having previously gained a considerable fan base when released digitally on the PSP system, this reimagining on the Nintendo 3DS system represents the first time the original cult classic horror title that spawned a new indie sub-genre will see a physical release in North America. Exclusive new features include 3D art stills, Touch Screen menus, four additional Extra Chapters, expanded story scenes, an in-game character encyclopedia, redrawn character sprites, and newly arranged music tracks. This is the definitive version of the classic horror tale that spans over 50 years of tragedy, where player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4or2.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"XSEED Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team GrisGris","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":30627,"name":"8-Bit Arena VR","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Alert!
