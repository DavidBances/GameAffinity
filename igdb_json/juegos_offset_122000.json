Feed and develop your Magikarp to maximize the Pokémon's jump power to reach new heights. Then compete to see if your Magikarp is the best. Can your Magikarp rise to the level of League Champion?\n\nDuring your training, if Magikarp gets knocked out, or retires upon reaching Lv. 20, you'll start over with a new generation of Magikarp. But not all progress is lost—your new Pokémon will start off a little bit stronger than your last. Keep training every Magikarp until you can make it to the top of the in-game tournament ladder!\n\nWhile you're raising your Magikarp, keep an eye out for Pokémon that want to help you. For example, some Pokémon you encounter will give you food to keep your Magikarp nourished.\n\nWhen you do well in jumping tournaments, you can get commemorative photos of your achievement. You can share these photos online and with friends to show the world how well you've trained your Magikarp.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1sb6.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SELECT BUTTON","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The Pokémon Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":31556,"name":"TrackMania 2: Lagoon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Trackmania² Lagoon has you racing on raised tracks above a tropical island filled with insane activities.\n\nIt comes with a free Trackmania multiplayer channel, an exclusive solo campaign, a new game mode and a world of possibilities in user-generated content thanks to an upgraded Maniaplanet system increasing the creative power of players.\n\nLike other Trackmania² games, Trackmania² Lagoon is pure fun and simple, offering thrilling graphics and instant gameplay.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co23ge.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nadeo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":31204,"name":"512","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co84tv.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":29489,"name":"SmuggleCraft","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As a smuggler, your hovercraft is your life.

Strap yourself in for hardcore gameplay uniquely designed for VR headsets.\n\nTrapped in an abandoned space station, you must race against borrowed time to find your crew before your oxygen supply runs out. As you solve puzzles to open airlocks, locate power cores and disable transmitters, something tells you that you won’t be alone when you finally escape into the universe’s deep infinity.\n\n---\n\nThese are the tenets of deep space society. Detached drops you at the edge of a universe destroyed by human misrule and extortion. Thanks to years of warfare and greed, the human colonies in deep space are no more. The great factions have crumbled; the corrupt corporations have dissolved.\nMost people adhere to the last remaining code of humanity: no killing. But in the lonely expanse of space where resources are low, many are willing to bend the rules to survive.\n\n“Detached will give you tons of freedom in how you play, and the gaming sensation is intense,” says Łukasz Hacura, Creative Director of Anshar Studios, “players of our Early Access release told us exactly what we needed to know to make the game absolutely electrifying for virtual reality headset users.”\n\nDetached isn't just a game; it’s an experience. Unlike many games where VR is a mere expansion, VR is the primary asset of Detached. To complete the game, you must master the controls of your EVA spacesuit and develop your ability to move in a realistic zero-G environment.\n\nPut your skills to the test in both single-player and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer pits you against your friends in an entirely new take on capture the flag. Race against each other to gather the necessary skills and complete your mission. Every second is precious, and every choice you make can mark the difference between life and death.\n\nSingle-player mode makes full use of the VR headset, giving you the chance to interact with the tranquil expanse of space. Beta players have lauded Detached’s sandbox environment that encourages players to enjoy the types of experiences normally only felt by astronauts.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3wp1.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Anshar Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Oculus Rift"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation VR"}]},{"id":12206,"name":"Inner Chains","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Inner Chains is an FPS horror embedded in an unprecedented surreal world.
