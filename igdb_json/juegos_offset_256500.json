In each corner of the maze are power pellets; when Ms. Pac-Man eats one of these, the ghosts temporarily turn blue and are no longer a threat (the player can earn bonus points for eating ghosts while blue). On some sides of the screen are warp tunnels which transport the player to the opposite side of the screen; if a ghost follows through the tunnel they are unable to move as fast allowing the player to use them to escape. Once all of the dots in the maze have been eaten, the player continues to the next level. As the levels progress, the difficulty is increased by increasing the overall game speed and the duration the ghosts remain blue after eating a power pellet is shortened (eventually disappearing altogether).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9dsj.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"General Computer Corporation (GCC)","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":277558,"name":"Ms. Pac-Man","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9ds6.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"General Computer Corporation (GCC)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atari","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"}]},{"id":277559,"name":"Ms. Pac-Man","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pac-Man is in love!
