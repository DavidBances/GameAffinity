It's set against backdrops of fully-realized 3D environments, where the beauty of space becomes an integral part of player immersion, setting Starminer apart as a visually stunning and technologically advanced space base-building game.

the hero Jim and defeat the demon Varalys, the strongest in mythology! A classic action RPG representing the 1980s. An active role-playing game released by T&E SOFT in 1984.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Jim, a brave young man, and his objective is to restore peace to Fairyland by searching for the lost gem and defeating the demon Varalys. Action is the key to this game. Players switch between attack and defense modes as they fight monsters by slamming Jim into them.\n\nThis game is a pioneer of the Japanese PC fantasy RPGs of the 1980's. It is a monster title that reigned at the top of the popularity rankings in PC game magazines for a long time, with its diverse and beautifully composed fields, including plains, castles, churches, and labyrinths.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mx8.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"D4 Enterprise","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":280608,"name":"Eggconsole Xanadu PC-8801mkIISR","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A monster title that recorded sales of 400,000 copies in the Japanese PC game market. When talking about the history of RPGs, you can’t leave this one out - it’s a must-play!\n\nA side-view action RPG released by Nihon Falcom in 1985, the player takes on the role of an adventurer to explore a total of 10 stages and ultimately defeat the King Dragon. Stores are placed on the map and monsters roam the streets, but monsters are finite and cease to appear once they are hunted down.\n\nCombat uses a symbol-encounting system. When you come in contact with an enemy, the battle scene switches to the battlefield, where you fight using weapon attacks (body blows) and magic. Treasure chests appear when enemies are defeated, and items and money can be acquired.\n\nIn this game, the player character does not have a profession, but has two types of experience and levels: warrior and wizard, and can grow into either a warrior or wizard type depending on which type of character is used to defeat enemies. Weapons, armor, and magic also have experience values, and using the same items can result in increased effectiveness.\n\nWith domestic sales of 400,000 units (Japan), this PC game from the 1980s still holds a record that remains unbroken.
