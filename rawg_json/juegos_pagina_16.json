The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy’s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as “kingdoms”). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario’s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2017,"developer":"Nintendo","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":2767,"name":"Far Cry Primal","genre":"Action","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/119/119bb59e64c7956171a33df0d35aee6b.jpg","description":"THE DIGITAL APEX EDITION\nTHE DIGITAL APEX EDITION\nALL ADDITIONAL DIGITAL CONTENT FOR FAR CRY PRIMAL:\nLEGEND OF THE MAMMOTH: 3 extra missions.\nDrink from the shaman's cup to play as the largest animal in Oros, the almighty mammoth.

All six players spawn on a vast map, with several of your group being infected with a virus that allows them to transform in their terror form. The players have to figure out who is infected, kill them or at least attempt an escape. \n\nMost of the time, the map is lit up by portable lamps and projectors, yet there are blackout periods that last several minutes. During these periods, the infected players can transform into the terror form in which they become faster, stronger, and have night vision. They can only be countered using light. \n\nFor the non-infected players, there are several objectives placed around the map, like turning on the generators, finding light sources or weapons. These objectives both increase the chance of player survival and sometimes allow the players to escape off the map. \n\nThe gameplay heavily relies on its psychological component with the maps being designed in a way to place a seed of doubt in the players' heads. The players have to decide with whom they'd want to stay close to or leave behind. It is necessary to display your intentions correctly, so the game features an emote system, which allows the players who do not have a microphone to interact with the others.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2017,"developer":"Automaton","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC"}]},{"id":11567,"name":"The Red Solstice","genre":"Action","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d87/d87268c4b7b33b278cbc1f152db39729.jpg","description":"The Red Solstice is an isometric tactical co-op survival game developed by Ironward.\n\nIn the distant future, a storm broke out on colonized Mars leaving the colonies without contact with the capital.

At its release, Skullgirls was developed by Reverge Labs, but the team that created the game split off from the company to form Lab Zero. In Japan, the game is published by Arc System Works. On Nintendo Switch, the game is published by Skybound Games.\n\nSkullgirls takes place in the Canopy Kingdom, inspired by 1940s America, in which corruption and conflict runs rampant. Once every seven years, an artifact called the Skull Heart appears, granting the wish of one woman. However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.\n\nThe game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.\n\nSkullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.\n\nIn February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000.

After winning, a full demo was produced and taken around various public shows where it was met with great enthusiasm by gamers of all ages. Buoyed by its success, full production began when the team returned home to Sumo HQ. The culmination has resulted in Snake Pass, a truly one of a kind game featuring the most unlikely of heroes; Noodle the Snake!","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2017,"developer":"Sumo Digital","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":10281,"name":"Besiege","genre":"Strategy","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/5704316c673fab6994db582e0f43f924.jpg","description":"In Besiege, you build impossible siege weapons and launch them to see if they will work. The game uses realistic physics system and was often compared to Kerbal Space Program. Each machine has to be assembled before use. The player is given a variety of modules to build from, and they include all kinds of weaponry, not necessarily medieval. Using improbable combinations of wheels, drills, spikes, blades, propellers, cannons, and water hoses you can turn your death machine into a plane, a tank, a robot, or rather something not found in the real world. Each machine is built with a purpose to complete a level objective, be it to destroy an enemy castle, slaughter the opposing army, or move an object to a destination. Levels include many kinds of obstacles, such as landmines, trees, rocks, and enemy soldiers. \nThe machines can be of any shape, however grotesque or impractical. If they’re not well-thought or too shaky to withstand attacks and obstacles, they will fall apart, catch fire, or explode. However, failing spectacularly is half the fun of Besiege.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2015,"developer":"Spiderling Studios","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC"},{"id":0,"name":"macOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":23191,"name":"Aegis Defenders","genre":"Action","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/054/054ab7dd5e83f84f1ec8bedf849b627f.jpg","description":"HUMANITY HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK INTO THE DARK AGES, BUT REMNANTS OF A ONCE HIGHLY ADVANCED CIVILIZATION STILL EXIST.\nIn a world where control over ancient technologies means power, a ruthless Empire has arisen.
