Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels.

The backdrop story is set in the 22th century when multinational companies fight over resources. \n \nThe game features overall eight multiplayer modes (e.g. Deathmatch, Rocket Arena or Gladiator) with differences regarding rules and winning conditions, but generally they all involve the player fighting alone against the opposition by running (and floating) around, shooting weapons at other players and picking up power-ups (e.g. armor, shields or damage multiplier) which spawn on the 28 maps. The basic stats of the player's mech, e.g. armor or the boost speed, are determined by the chosen pilot character and the used mech components which can be changed for arms, legs, chassis, head, booster and weapon load-out.

It's nothin' but you... the road... and the clock.\n\nEndorsed by the ultimate rally driver himself, Colin McRae Rally remains as faithful to its 3D counterparts as possible. A variety of real-life major rallying cars are available, including Skoda, Ford and the Subaru Impreza. After selecting a car, players can race one of 25 different tracks. Each track has its own unique features and is subject to a variety of weather conditions.\n\nThe main difference in graphics is the change from the first/third person perspective to an overhead 2D viewpoint. With a little experience, the change of perspective is not a big deal. The same racing techniques still apply: take the corners wide, dab the brakes, turn into the corners early and counter-steer to hold the power slide.\n\nThree modes of play that comprise of Time Trial, Rally and Championship have been included, and the gameplay is as unforgiving as the original PlayStation classics. Quite often, bumping just one single corner in a race can knock you back several places. With rally games, the best strategy is often to learn the track at a slow pace and gradually pick up speed, perfecting corners as you progress. Colin McRae Rally for Game Boy Color is no different. The initial frustration with the difficulty is replaced with a satisfied feeling, as you master a course and put in a seemingly untouchable lap record.\n\nGiving even further variety to the game, players are able to take damage in races, forcing them to make repairs in the game’s garage section. The damage adds to the realism and directly influences your driving style. Wall riding around tight hairpins is only faster in the short term, but the time you lose from damage could cost you the race.\n\nIf you like racing games, Colin McRae Rally impresses with its solid gameplay and digitised speech.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co63dt.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Spellbound","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":49884,"name":"Stuart Little: The Journey Home","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This little mouse has one big journey ahead of him, and you're just the one to help him out.

Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\".\n\nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs.\n\nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9cqh.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":4630,"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.\n\nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers.\n\nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die. Levant (the original title's protagonist) is now a guardian and acts as your guide.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ni9.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Genki","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":6482,"name":"Jurassic Park III: Island Attack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"More closely based on the events of the movie, Jurassic Park III, you play Paleontologist Alan Grant who is part of an observation of Isla Sorna.

Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect.\n\nWeapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co87pj.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Metro3D","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":6409,"name":"Fortress","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fortress is a FAST-ACTION strategy game where players build an endless variety of unique structures and compete against each other in an all out war to the end!

This game was the first of its kind which allowed the player to interact in an entirely original 2.5D world, and can be credited as the game that started graphic adventure gaming on the PC. Though the original AGI parser-based version is outdated and primitive-looking by today's gaming standards, in 1984 it was revolutionary. King's Quest I was not only groundbreaking, but also history in the making. It was followed by seven sequels bearing the King's Quest title.\n\nIn 1990, Sierra released a remake of King's Quest I, taking advantage of newer technology and graphics (using their SCI engine, 16 color EGA graphics, sound card, and mouse support). Unfortunately, this version ended up being a total market failure. As a result, it was highly unlikely that Sierra ever had thoughts of making an even further updated Point-and-Click version of King's Quest I to match later games in the series. This is where we at AGDI decided to step in. Our aim was to remake King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown to the same level of quality as seen in Sierra's King's Quest V. We believe that the enhanced gaming experience for fans has justified our months of unpaid hard work.\n\nOur understanding is that the big companies stopped focusing on the adventure genre because, given the huge budget required to produce adventure games, it didn't prove as lucrative as other genres which were faster and cheaper to develop. Yet, we're hoping that by bringing back such classics adventure titles, we can prove that there is still huge fan interest in Point-and-Click adventure games and a successful market out there. This is our contribution to try to bring classic adventure games, as we used to know them, back to public attention, providing an alternative gaming experience for players who prefer to use their brains to solve puzzles over quick reflexes.\n\nDuring the first month of AGDI releasing our King's Quest I remake in August, 2001, over 5,000 copies were downloaded! In the first year, that number jumped to nearly half a million. The first add-on voice pack was downloaded hundreds of times in a period of just a few days, and thousands of times over the span of several months! It's obvious that there are still numerous adventure gaming fans, around the world, yearning to play more titles from this fantastic genre. AGDI's King's Quest I remake, and all of our future projects, are our gift to the fans of the adventure gaming community.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3og3.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tierra Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":49981,"name":"WWF Betrayal","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It seems that there's a conspiracy afoot in the WWF! All of the other wrestlers have conspired against you, kidnapped Stephanie McMahon, and stolen the WWF Heavyweight Title belt. Choose to play as the Rock, Triple H, the Undertaker, or Stone Cold Steve Austin in this story-based wrestling game. You'll roam the streets, taking down thugs and seeking out valuable information along your journey to redemption. There'll be plenty of objects to pick up and throw, scenery to destroy, and havoc to wreak, but the only weapons you'll be given are your own bare fists and a solid pair of boots. Other weapons (steel pipes, cakes, and mailboxes) are available, though you'll have to defeat a few foes to earn them. Tons of power-ups are strewn throughout the game, but you'll be lucky if you can free up the time and energy to get to them. Awesome graphics, tough boss characters, and a great story make this one unique wrestling title.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co988u.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"WayForward Technologies","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":43399,"name":"NFL GameDay 2002","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"NFL GameDay 2002 is the seventh video game in the NFL GameDay series.
