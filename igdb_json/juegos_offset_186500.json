Power Stone 2 allows up to four players to choose from multiple characters and utilize items such as tables, chairs, and rocks in battle.\n\nThere are four different modes available for the game\n\n1-on-1: Much like the original Power Stone, a two-character storyline game.\nArcade: A four-character storyline game, with two characters advancing each round.\nOriginal: Multiplayer mode, with free choice of characters and stages.\nAdventure: An unpredictable storyline game, where players can collect items, cards and money.\nPower Stone 2 offers five interactive 3-D stages to begin with, plus the two boss stages which players can also access in Original mode. All but the Original mode is played out like a storyline, where two battles are fought on the regular stages, followed by the Pharaoh Walker boss, then another battle, and ending with the Dr. Erode boss stage. Three extra stages may be unlocked for Original mode by meeting certain requirements in Arcade mode, as well as a desert area stage, which is essentially the Pharaoh Walker boss stage, but without the boss. Though each player has their own set of default ground and air attacks, the character can execute more powerful fusion attacks after collecting three Power Stones and transforming. Power Stone 2 does not offer an opportunity to block, although tapping on the control pad just before an enemy attacks will cause you to dodge.\n\nMost of the stages are dynamic and will change as the battle progresses. For example, the airplane stage starts out on a warplane. After a set amount of time, the plane will fall apart, forcing all the players to battle while skydiving toward the ground. Shortly after, the players will fall onto a floating platform, where the remainder of the battle will be held. This, in essence, creates three sub-stages within a single one.\n\nEach stage is also littered with item boxes, which hold a random item that a player has acquired and unlocked in Adventure mode or created in the Item Shop. They may also contain Power Stones. Items are extremely diverse. Damaging items range from guns, flamethrowers, gigantic hammers, a wide assortment of swords, to bear traps, roller blades, and even a magazine that can be thrown. Non-damaging items include food that will replenish health, shields for defense, elixirs for invisibility, adhesive sprays to slow your opponents, and wings for extra jumps. Cards that can be used to mix items can also be found in Adventure mode. Furthermore, most stages also have their own collection of unique items and fixtures that the player can use. For example, the submarine level comes with turrets, small planes to drop bombs, and icebergs to throw at opponents. Each level is also highly interactive, as players can use many of the stage elements themselves. All players can also gain extra height by jumping off a wall.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8izi.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":10904,"name":"Evergrace","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Two complete adventures await Darius and Sharline - heroes who must face an evil reborn.

After a piece was moved, a predefined delay prevented it from moving again for a short period of time. This, plus piece movements not being instantaneous, meant that speed and timing were crucial aspects of the game, as any delay could determine whether a piece was captured or whether said piece dodged the opponent's pieces. In addition to this, the game's \"real-time\" aspect led to essential differences between Kung-Fu Chess and standard chess. For instance, checks and pins did not exist in the game, since players were not bound to one move at a time and thus could respond to threats with multiple piece movements. Checkmate and stalemate were similarly both impossible to achieve; as such, the game only ended when one's king was physically captured or if one's opponent resigned. In following with the martial arts theme, the game also featured a rating system categorized by belt colors.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co47wp.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":104973,"name":"Anstoss Premier Manager","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pi47io6lgygxuk7c79on.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":93956,"name":"Planetarion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Planetarion is a browser-based massively multiplayer online game created by Fifth Season AS in early 2000.

Mankind has colonized the solar system and two political entities have emerged: the Alliance consisting of American, Australian, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British and German forces, and The Coalition of Russian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern interests. The game begins with a surprise attack on Fort Kennedy, where a peace treaty turns into a bloodbath: all of the inner four planets are overrun, including Terra herself, and the Italian and French fleets are utterly lost. The Alliance fleet regroups at Triton, Neptune's moon, and attempts to regain lost territory. The player takes the role of a rookie pilot in the international 45th Volunteers squadron, under the command of Captain Robert Foster and Wing Commander Maria Enriquez, aboard the re-commissioned British carrier ANS Reliant.\n\nAs with Wing Commander: Prophecy, the pilot's flying ability is the only meter by which success and failure is measured, though Starlancer does not feature as many branching mission paths. As in Wing Commander I the pilot may be promoted throughout the course of the campaign; unlike WCI, their rank determines which fighters and missiles they may choose to employ during each mission. The game provides a \"virtual carrier\" through which to navigate, including nearby crewmembers whose reaction to you depends on your current rank and standing. However, the true gem of the game lies in its textual and video news broadcasts, which keep the player informed as to the status of the rest of the war, which seems to be progressing just over the horizon. Players frequently find themselves flying alongside squadrons and pilots they have heard about on the news just recently, providing a dose of 'celebrity exposure' and also increasing the sensation that they are just one part of a much larger war effort.\n\nStarlancer's story is continued in Chris Roberts' Freelancer project, though the two belong to different subgenres (the first is purely focused on action, the latter also features trading and the player can freely move through the game's universe when they are not on a mission.)","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jps.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":9282,"name":"Messiah","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bob is an angel ordered by God himself to go and clean up the putrid world of the future.

Each \"floor\" is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they've cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use.\n\nAll the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2u7t.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":44693,"name":"Driving Emotion Type-S","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Driving Emotion Type-S takes advantage of the power of the PlayStation2 computer entertainment system to bring you real-world physics, and realistically rendered cars and tracks.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kbr.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":37480,"name":"Super Robot Taisen Compact 2 Dai-1-bu: Chijou Gekidou-hen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Robot Taisen Compact 2 Dai-1-Bu: Chijou Gekidou-hen is a Strategy game, developed by TOSE and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 2000.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5qhu.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan"}]},{"id":25008,"name":"Gunlok","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"At the end of the 21st Century, robots finally enslaved mankind.

Though it is listed as one of Doomworld's Top 100 WADs of All Time in the year 1999, its release on the idgames archive dates it at 17 March of 2000. It is known primarily for being composed of short, fairly straightforward levels, a possible progenitor of Erik Alm's Scythe.\n\nDemonfear is a compilation of small episodes released by Windsor between 1995 and 1999, known otherwise as Demonfear 1-6. An early, alternate version of Demonfear 6 was partially complete in 1997, but Windsor donated the maps to Requiem when the project had stagnated due to a handful of authors failing to provide maps for slots they had claimed. The compiler dropped Windsor's levels into the previously vacant slots so that his old Demonfear 6 MAP26, 27, and 28 appear as Requiem's MAP20, 26, and 25, respectively. Windsor would go on to create a new Demonfear 6 and then compile his own megawad.\n\nDemonfear comes with a text file that describes in detail the story of the megawad on a level-by-level basis. The plot involves another surprise demon invasion of Earth; mirroring the action of Doom II, the protagonist travels through various military complexes and into a city, eventually entering Hell itself in what is apparently a twisted facsimile of the normal world.\n\nIn 2019, Doomworld user P41R47 made a MIDI pack for Demonfear, which also includes miscellaneous enhancements for the intermission, text screens, and ending.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4n49.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":83231,"name":"Sylvanian Melody: Mori no Nakama to Odorimasho!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A music game based on the Sylvanian Families toy line.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6s8h.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":78221,"name":"Train Simulator: JR Higashi-nihon Keihin Tohoku-sen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Another entry in the Train Simulator series of FMV games by Ongakukan, featuring the JR East Keihin Tohoku Line between Kamata and Omiya.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fbframd23btmecda7wwt.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":76776,"name":"Macross 7: Ginga no Heart o Furuwa Sero!!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Macross 7 is a horizontally-scrolling shooter based on the anime of the same name.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/f3ezmr9d7hwiuxpnok9z.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":63506,"name":"RPG Tsukuuru GB","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"RPG makin' goes portable!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4zur.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":43920,"name":"Kakuge Yarou: Fighting Game Creator","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Full-scale construction tools with the ability to create 2D games action fighting game!

Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it.

An enchanted weapon is the closest a Warrior gets to magic but that’s OK, because magic is for sissies.\nAs a Wizard you will explore the mystical art of spell casting, ranging from enemy-confounding illusions to devastating displays of metaphysical force. You’ll also learn to set magical traps containing deadly spell combinations to thwart the unsuspecting foe.

It was written by Ryousuke Takahashi, who also created the series with Sunrise and shared directorial duties with Goro Taniguchi.\n\nThe series is marked by an exceptionally detailed and convincing treatment of mecha design and operation, albeit within the context of the alternate reality of the story. Set in the near-future (at the time of release), a little-understood form of matter known as \"Mile One\" allows a powerful and influential Japanese family, the Gowa, to produce a bipedal weapon which they refer to as a Tactical Armor (TA).\n\nAt this time a war breaks out between the US and the fictional Middle East country of Belgistan, much like the Gulf War. When US military forces attempt to seize the capital they are systematically wiped out by what appear to be rival TAs. The Gowa Family seizes this opportunity to demonstrate their weapon system, and civilian pilot Yuushiro Gowa and the military squad to which he is attached are deployed to Belgistan. There, he meets rival TA pilot Miharu, with whom he seems to share a deep spiritual bond.\n\nIn the game the player can choose 3 different members of the team to make the assault group for each mission, and he can choose also what mecha and what weapon each member will use. The gameplay is about moving the mechas in the missing area and defeat the enemies that are around there. Some missions got a time limit.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6est.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":39598,"name":"NFL Blitz 2000: Gold Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Players choose an official NFL team, each with unique statistics, and compete in American football games with very few real-world rules.

We control a green dragon (and in the game mode for two - also blue), which shoots green bubbles at enemies, and as soon as the enemies hit them, they immediately find themselves in a trap, and we calmly pop these bubbles as a dragon. And from the enemies we get their leftovers in the form of various kinds of food: from fruits to a mug of beer, which also appear as a randomly appearing bonus. There are only 8 enemies - these are clockwork toys familiar to us from the original, and weirdos in a white cloak, and brown ghosts similar to octopuses, and flying monsters with a propeller, and jumpers, and fluffy monsters, and sorcerers, and spiders. If clockwork toys, propeller monsters and octopuses are not particularly dangerous, and they can be easily killed, then here are the rest to be wary of. You should especially be wary of types in white robes and sorcerers who, when they meet you, launch fireballs at you. Sometimes there are several of them at the levels. In some levels, it happens that the monsters are in a small room of platforms, the path to which either leads to a trap or does not exist at all. Then bubbles with lightning come to the rescue, with the help of which you can instantly kill enemies. And if there is open space at the same time, then you can use bubbles with water, crushing enemies when interacting with the player, and with fire, leaving behind traps that kill enemies in the form of a fire floor.\n\nAt levels, bubbles with letters appear from time to time, with which you can make a word and teleport to an empty room without enemies, where you will receive prizes in the form of bonuses and an increase in a unit of health.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6jq3.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":250609,"name":"Die CD-ROM mit der Maus 1","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Playing, learning, puzzling, drawing and making music with the Mouse and the Elephant.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ja8.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":249127,"name":"Tonic Trouble","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6n12.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":247469,"name":"I Spy School Days","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"I Spy is the fourth game in an educational game series based on the series of children's hidden object books.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6fe4.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":245621,"name":"Super Mario Bros.
