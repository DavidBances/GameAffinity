This newest game is challenging, exciting, and even infuriating, at times. Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.\n\nThe game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.\n\nSounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won‚Äôt throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it‚Äôs game over, and you‚Äôll have to start over again.\n\nChallenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately. Like Gram‚Äôs other hits, the gameplay is simple and fun, but earning a spot on the leaderboard and competing with friends provides both a challenge, and a reward.\n\nKey Features\n‚óè  Easy to learn, and fun to master gameplay\n‚óè  Challenge your friend‚Äôs high scores, challenge the world\n‚óè  Fun, colorful and engaging graphics\n‚óè  Exciting and addictive\n‚óè  Fun four hours, or just a few minutes","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/w6dbbpbllklgqepny8le.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":88775,"name":"SongPop Classic","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Listen to actual songs and guess as fast as you can, featuring music from all your favorite artists- whether Taylor Swift, Drake, Selena Gomez, and Justin Bieber or Van Halen, Queen, Ed Sheeran and more!
