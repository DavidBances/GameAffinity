All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge. Math Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution. In Math Classroom Challenge there are two types of mathematical panels with hundreds of math combinations: static and dynamic. The static panels propose random exercises, of configurable difficulty, whose numbers have to be searched through the stage, and bathe them with the water of the hose that we carry. Dynamic panels appear anywhere, but can be repositioned, or even invoked manually, and contain three solutions. Irrigate with water the correct solution. Dragons, on the other hand, allow an error to be subtracted, although sometimes they will cause the opposite: they will add up to an error. So the player must decide whether to use them or not.
