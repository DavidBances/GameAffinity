For each day that the zoo survives without being run down by trampling dinos, the player receives income and gets access to new types of dinosaurs. After the first week new goals are offered when you do not put up new fences, make sure that less visitors die than the day before, or survive a PETA inspection.

Some can sit together, while others need to stay away from each other. Certain dinosaurs need lots of space and others get angry when too many fences surround them.
