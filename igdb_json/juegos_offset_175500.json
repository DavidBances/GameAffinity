The company's latest PS2 racer, Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix, maintains many of the same gameplay mechanics that Genki's other games contain, but this time it takes the cars off of the streets and drops them onto proper racetracks.\n\nRacing Battle will contain licensed cars. The version on display only has a handful, including an RX-7, a Supra, an Integra, an Impreza, and an S2000. The car models in the game look decent. They're nice and smooth, but they don't seem to be quite as detailed as the car models in some other comparable racing games.\n\nLike most other racing games, Racing Battle has multiple camera angles. But the first-person angle is pretty interesting. From this view, you get indicators that show how hard you're steering, accelerating, or braking. You also get a second, TV-style camera angle in a small window at the top of the screen. This is cool because it gives you a good idea of what's going on near your car. It's easy to see cars coming up behind you with this view and more effective than a standard rearview mirror.\n\nThe gameplay in Racing Battle is roughly the same as what Genki has done with Shutokou and Kaido Battle series. Each car is associated with a fighting gamelike life meter, and the car in second place constantly loses pieces of its life meter. When one car runs out of \"health,\" the race ends and a winner is declared.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co94qq.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Genki","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":203361,"name":"Simple 2000 Series Ultimate Vol. 25: Chou Saisoku!

The player controls a pair of interconnected portals that can be placed on any non-metallic surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve Corporation, took interest in the team's work and employed the whole staff at Valve. The developers went on to make Portal (2007) using many of the same concepts.\n\nThe word Narbacular, which does not exist in any dictionary, was chosen primarily to aid in internet search engine results.\n\nBeing mostly a proof of applied concept, the game contains only six puzzles to solve.

Each click removes fog from one space and reveals some information about what may be found in nearby spaces. Alternatively, once the player has removed enough fog to reveal useful terrain features, they may use a turn to instead build roads between cities, search them for hidden treasures, or take other actions to prepare for the barbarian hordes.\n\nWhen the player runs out of turns, the barbarians arrive (from where?) and attack. The player will have ten seconds to move people to the nearest city (if the player built the right roads!) and then it's out of your hands. Victory depends on having made the right preparations.

It was developed by LucasArts using the Unreal Engine, and published for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows in 2005. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes. In the story, set in the Star Wars Legends expanded universe, players assume the role of RC-1138 (\"Boss\"), an elite clone trooper, known as \"clone commando\", and the leader of the special ops unit Delta Squad, consisting of three fellow clone commandos with distinctive personalities and character traits: RC-1262 (\"Scorch\"), RC-1140 (\"Fixer\"), and RC-1207 (\"Sev\"). The story follows Delta Squad as they complete increasingly difficult missions throughout the Clone Wars and learn to bond as a team.\n\nRepublic Commando received generally favorable reviews at release. Many critics praised the story and combat, but criticized the short length and average multiplayer. In the years since its release, it has come to be considered one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and has gained a cult following.\n\nAn enhanced port of the game by Aspyr is set to release for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 6, 2021. As reported by Jordan Ramée of GameSpot, \"Handled by Aspyr Media, Star Wars: Republic Commando Remastered brings the original 2005 Xbox and PC game to PS4 and Switch with enhanced HD graphics and modernized controls, though the multiplayer is absent. Otherwise, it's the same game. And though the flaws in its gameplay are only more noticeable now 16 years later, this remaster manages to still deliver a compelling story of four specialized commandos engaging in a variety of combat missions across the Clone Wars.\".","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2au4.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"LucasArts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Aspyr Media","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]}]
