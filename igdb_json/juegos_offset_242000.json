It takes place on a screen that represents a film studio, players take turns to click on a spinner which tells them how many squares they can move. Apart from the first move the players can move in any direction and the game highlights all possible moves for them. Each space on the game board is a different colour corresponding to the question category, Animation, Film, Song, Personalities and Mousellaneous, and all questions are multiple choice. If a player gets the question right they spin again and attempt another, if they get it wrong the next player takes their turn and so on. If a player lands on a space that is already occupied then there is a challenge question, all players on that square can take part ans tokens can be both won and lost. There is also a trivia vault where the player(s) can gamble one of their tokens for the vault's entire contents. Each time the player answers a question correctly they are awarded a token in that category, or in some cases a wild card token, and when five tokens have been logged for a category the player wins a medallion in that category. The object of the game is to collect a medallion in every category and at which point they will be allowed to attempt the champion question to win the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5v3o.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":228443,"name":"Minnie","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Minnie and her friends are having a fashion show and they need your help to get ready!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5v3k.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":228442,"name":"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"3 interactive learning games reinforce skills such as number order, maths, and shapes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5v3j.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":228439,"name":"150 Floors","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"150 Floors of Magic or 150 Floors for short, is a tile-based, real-time strategy RPG where you play as a mage with either a Fire, Ice or Electric element, with more to come.
