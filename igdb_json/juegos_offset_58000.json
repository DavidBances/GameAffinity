Being that way, the first thing he started doing after leaving the facility with his sister - Chidori - was to find and make friends. \n \nBenio Azusa, a tomboyish girl who lived nearby. \n \nHondou Sayaka, a quiet yet sharp-tongued girl who was in charge of raising the pets at school just like him. \n \nTsukamoto Youko and Itsuki, a pair of siblings who belong to a prestigious family around the area. \n \nHiguchi Shouji, a boy he knew by being attracted to by the similarities they both share. \n \nIzuki Fueko, a girl he met by chance. \n \nTogether with Shinobu, they were a group of seven. Just like that, each and every one of them, who had never experienced the joy of having friends, was able to meet each other and become companions. The story begins in a quiet town colored by dusk. Around the seven friends, there were understanding, empathy, conflict, and what's more, fleeting love of adolescence. It was a friendship that could last forever. \n \nSuch a simple happiness should have... lasted forever. \n \nThat was until the \"enemy\" appeared. \n \nThe \"enemy\" had disturbed the peaceful relationship of the seven people. \nShinobu could not forgive that. He could not forgive the one that injures his companions, nor could he forgive the one that hurts another one's hearts. And when he realized all that, the world they reside in changed, rather then becoming the new world that it should have... they had arrived at the \"sanctuary\" instead. \n \nThis is a story that describes the heart. \n \nA story that describes the thing located in the farthest end of a heart.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mox.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Xuse","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Regista","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":62737,"name":"Survivor: Day One","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A cancelled Nintendo 64 action-adventure game by Konami.

The team needs to neutralize threads and can choose between six different agencies, such as GSG-9, NOCS, Team Alfa and the SAS. The player can only control one team member at a time, but issue general commands to the other two members such as \"follow\" or \"hold\". At any time, it is possible to directly take control of any of the other team members. This is useful as every agent has access to different weaponry, but the game also encourages the player to place agents in tactical positions to provide cover fire when entering new areas.\n\nMissions consist of securing objectives and taking out the opposition. Weapons, ammo or health do not need to be collected. Each agent has a number of different weapons and can switch between them. These include handguns, shotguns, machine guns and sniper rifles. There is a zoom option, a melee attack and the agents can duck or prone when the situation requires it. A mini-map in the top right corner keeps track of enemy opposition and the location of objectives.

Identifying himself as Baskal, the figure delivers a strange prophecy to Pietro, and asks the prince a question.\n\n\"What do you think the true treasure of kings is?\"\n\nWith this question begins a touching, romantic, and sometimes tragic journey that will reunite Pietro with familiar faces, introduce him to new companions, and forever change the boy prince of the Kingdom of PoPoLoCrois.\n\nA much beloved sequel that many fans remember as the high point of the series, PoPoLoCrois Monogatari II builds on the already beautiful pixel art graphics of the first game, with detailed, lovingly crafted environments and some outstanding sprite animation. Spread across three discs, the game also features full voice acting for its story sequences, which was a series first, and a relative rarity for RPGs of the era.\n\nThe battle system broadly resembles that of its prequel, with combat taking place directly within the game's environments, and movement and positioning playing a key role in battles. But certain features have been simplified and streamlined compared to the first game, and the level of difficulty is generally a lot lower.\n\nMany of the game's events were loosely adapted in the third chapter of the 2005 PSP title PoPoLoCrois.
