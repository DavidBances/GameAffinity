You can decide you if you want to play a Friendly match (for a short game), Practice (the best way for rookies to learn how to play), and competitions (where you get different options, like Championship, league, Knockout and world cup).\n\nIn the main menu you also have the options to edit teams! Yes you can edit your country name, and can put in your favorite names for the players on your team, an option that very few games offered at that time. You can also change the colors of your team’s uniforms, and choose the best tactic (to play in a 4-2-2 or 3-5-2 formation and such). You can even change the face of your players. Fantastic, isn’t it?! And another great option of this game is that all players have their unique statistics. But the possibilities don’t end here. You even get to choose between an indoor and a traditional outdoor tournament. The indoor tournaments (as you may know) are actually a whole different game of soccer. The ball can never be out of the field, your players run faster, and there are many more differences that make separate this game from the traditional game.\n\nYou can play with comments, like the British style that you can see on TV, and with or without music. You can define the time for every match (it can be between 2 and 10 minutes) and you can play either with the keyboard, or with a joystick.\n\nThe graphics are good for the time of game’s release, at the same style is similar to Vr Soccer, they use a 3D environment, that gives you more realistic movements of the players, which gives a more realistic feel while playing soccer. This game also has an option for two players, playing in the same team or one against the other.

The game combines many classic gameplay ideas in one title, delivering a large amount of variety and keeps the game experience fresh.\n\nThe eleven games are all linked to a central theme - collecting sand dollars to enable you to travel to new islands, buy toys and food for your Tamagotchi-style monkey, and unlock even more games to play.\n\nEach mini game offers the player a different gameplay experience. These are some of them:\n\nPuffer Popper\nWith help from Crab the player must defend the sand castle by destroying bubbles as they snake towards the beach.\n\nA classic and instantly playable concept, Puffer Popper requires the player to connect three bubbles of the same colour to win. Use the left and right joystick or directional pad to aim the beam, and press the action button to fire a bubble.\n\nThe game can be increased in difficulty through the addition of multiple Puffer fish and by potentially removing the players aiming beam.\n\nJungle Jump\nJungle jump is a game of timing and skill. Use the left and right buttons on the joystick or directional pad to guide the Monkey through increasingly difficult jungle levels.\n\nShell Game\nThe shell game is both a game of skill and observation coupled with a way to win more Sand Dollars. Conceptually the Shell Game is extremely simple: three shells that swap, the user must pick the shell that hides the pearl.\n\nDue to the high expense of certain shop items and the cost of purchasing new islands, the user can use the Shell Game to win the Sand Dollars required to make these large purchases.\n\nSandoku\nThe classic favorite Sudoku makes the transition to Tropix effectively, with intuitive play.\n\nCascade\nCascade is a casual concept. The game is a variation on the classic objective of connecting three of a kind. This type of game can be controlled exclusively via the joystick or directional pad with the addition of the action button to make selections.\n\nThe overall design is about linking these mini-games into a \"world\" where you buy things, look after a creature, travel around and explore. For casual gamers, Tropix is simple to play, and can be played in short bites or in long sessions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co38zx.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Robot Super Brain","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":92879,"name":"Tricky Kick","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Flex your thumbs and tease your brain!
