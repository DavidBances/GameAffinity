Not on that planet, at least. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing. That was always the nature of humankind. \n \nThe humans were lucky. They had a savior. A company called 'Guardians' emerged with enough resources to help evacuate most of the population of Earth. They were heroes. A group of the highest military rank joined the Guardian, and formed the 'military council', to supervise all human activities of outer space. \n \nBut humankind had much to learn. \n \nThe first curse was radiation. While humanity was sitting comfortably on Earth, waiting to be saved, they could not even imagine that most of outer space is lethal to human life. They can't survive certain radiation types, and in the end, they did not dare to explore. They did not go anywhere. They were imprisoned in the few gigantic Star Cruisers of the Guardians. \n \nThen the Guardians claimed that humankind can only survive if they are united, and form the future together. Together, they can be safe. It was a principle that was accepted for a short while, but fanaticism started to slowly take over the Guardian leaders. When they began to see the enemy in everyone, even executing people without much reason, the humans finally started to see what kind of people were controlling them. \n \nThis was the time when more than two million people stole ships from the hangars, and left the Guardian Cruisers far behind. A few million followed in the coming years. \n \nThe Guardians declared these people the 'Pirate horde', and finally, they had a reason to unite. Everyone who remained on the Cruisers became a Guardian, and from then on, the Guardian and Pirate became factions. \n \nHistorians tend to call this separation of human factions 'The Shattering'. \n \nTwo hundred years later the Pirate Wars are still devastating, and even on the brink of extinction, humankind keeps on fighting. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing.

There are graphics but nothing more than basic icon-on-map bare essentials. That may sound like a bad thing but in reality it's not since Carrier Strike more than makes up for that shortcoming by offering intense and detailed game play. The game is based on a fairly simple premise: have your carriers kick the stuffing out of their carriers. But the rub here is that in order to do that, you've got to find their carriers first. In a decidedly cat-and-mouse fashion, each day that dawns on the high seas of the South Pacific will find you desperately searching through bad weather, rough conditions or simply the enormous body of water to just locate the enemy before any sort of military action can take place. If you're an expert who knows the historically correct Japanese hiding spots, the designer has seen you coming and offers a random enemy placement option to keep you guessing.\n\nWhat makes Carrier Strike a challenging game, though, is the balancing act you'll be required to perform as the area commander over all the actions a carrier is capable of during war. Eventually, once you've found your targets, you'll quickly find yourself hip deep in the dizzying tasks of assigning combat air patrols for defense of your task force, managing weapons load-outs and fueling of various types of aircraft, giving orders for searches or air attacks, monitoring other ships and generally just holding the whole ball of wax together. All of this is accomplished through a turn-based system where each turn equals twenty minutes of real time. This becomes a factor in some operations and can lead to confusion or wasted blocks of time if your coordination skills are lacking. The hardware in Carrier Strike mirrors the actual weaponry, ships and planes that were used in the South Pacific during WWII. Outside influences such as the introduction of better radar and the slow decline of the enemy's pilot efficiency are realistically phased in during the game. Fortunately, the interface is fairly simple and easy to use since you'll need all your time coordinating events.\n\nUltimately, Carrier Strike will appeal to those war gamers who bask in statistics and a realistically based war machine. Those looking for flashy graphics and killer cut scenes won't find them here. Be prepared for a logistical and strategic exercise when in command of your Carrier Strike. Fast thinking and calm nerves will be a plus when faced with operating elevators bringing aircraft up to the deck while under heavy enemy fire and at the same time coordinating their missile and bomb loads, take off and mission orders. Selecting the appropriate aircraft and weapons based on what your search planes find requires precise scheduling and prompt decision making. Carrier Strike offers an accurate, enjoyable simulation of carrier warfare in the South Pacific.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7kla.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":47124,"name":"Alchemilla","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Alchemilla Mod is an attempt to recreate original atmosphere of cult game Silent Hill on the Source Engine.

Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte Magazine and mailed $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer.[1] Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. For example, the March–April 1979 issue of Recreational Computing describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published.[4]\n\nCommercialization through electronic media\nWhen magnetic media publishing became widely available, a Navy Petty Officer, Paul Lohnes, ported Sargon to the TRS-80, altering both graphics, input, and housekeeping routines leaving the Spracklen's chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: Hayden Software. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software. In the early 1980s SARGON CHESS was ported to several earlier microcomputers, i.e. NASCOM (by Bits & PCs, 1981), Exidy Sorcerer, Sharp MZ 80K,[5] and many others. A complete rewrite was necessary later for the Apple II port, made by Kathleen's brother Gary Shannon. Both were published by Hayden Software.\n\nSequels\nThe Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program[1] and released Sargon II. In 1978 it tied for third at the ninth North American Computer Chess Championship despite being seeded ninth of 12 entries. Sargon finished only behind Belle and Chess 4.7, and defeated AWIT—running on a $5 million Amdahl mainframe—amazing the audience.[6][3][1] That year they published a series of articles in BYTE on computer chess programming,[2][7] stating \"we think it would be nice if not everyone had to reinvent the wheel\".[6]\n\nSargon II was ported to a variety of personal computers popular in the early 1980s.[8] The game engine featured multiple levels of lookahead to make it more accessible to beginning chess players. BYTE in 1980 estimated that Sargon II had a 1500 rating at the highest tournament-time difficulty level, and speculated that it was the best chess program on sale, including dedicated devices.[9]\n\nSargon 2.5, sold as a ROM module for the Chafitz Modular Game System, was identical to Sargon II but incorporated pondering.[10] It received a 1641 rating at the Paul Masson tournament in June–July 1979, and 1736 at the San Jose City College Open in January 1980.[3]\n\nSargon 3.0 finished in seventh place at the October 1979 North American Computer Chess Championship. The competition had improved, but 3.0 drew against Cray Blitz and easily defeated Mychess, its main microcomputer rival. In December 3.0 easily won the second microcomputer championship in London.[3]\n\nIn 1980, the Spracklens' Reversi game finished in first place at a computer tournament at Northwestern University, and in 1981 it finished in third place at the Santa Cruz Open Othello Tournament.[11]\n\nSargon III was a complete rewrite from scratch. Instead of an exchange evaluator, this version used a capture search algorithm. Also included was a chess opening repertoire. This third version was written originally for the 6502 assembler and was commercially published by Hayden Software in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for 68000 assembly, Sargon III was the first third-party executable software for the Macintosh.[1]\n\nAfter the demise of Hayden Software, later chess programs were also released under the name Sargon, including Sargon IV (Spinnaker Software), Sargon V (Activision) and a CD-i title simply named Sargon Chess. The Spracklens concurrently wrote the engines for the dedicated chess computers produced by Fidelity Electronics, which won the first four World Microcomputer Chess Championships.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/y5jp2huijh08yv9zlr4m.jpg","releaseYear":1979,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore Business Machines, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore VIC-20"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":47210,"name":"F1 GP Circuits","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"F1 GP Circuits is an arcade-style Formula 1 racing game that focuses on quick reflexes and strategic pit management.

Battles are started when the player runs into various pairs of moving footprints on the ground. This takes the player to a separate enclosed battlefield. There the player can use their weapons (or ESP powers) to defeat their enemies. Winning battles will increase the player's character's experience points, eventually leveling them up when they reach certain experience point totals. Leveling up increases their Hit Points {HP} and ESP Points {EP}. The player can also buy weapons by using the Gold Pieces that defeated enemies leave behind.\n\nThe game is over when the player's HP reaches zero - or when the player has successfully saved Brick Town from the evil scourge.\n\nUp to three save slots are available. They allow players the opportunity to save their progress and return to their adventure at a later date.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co91zi.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer Disk System"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":47244,"name":"Chariot Race","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore VIC-20"}]},{"id":47245,"name":"Skyjet","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are the pilot of a helicopter and your mission is to explore five levels to find parts to help build a supply base on each level.

The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers.\n\nElectronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.\n\nThe game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.\n\nForty-three countries have been divided into eleven \"politectonic\" or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.\n\nThese figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.\n\nPp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)\n\nPERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).\n\nFuture shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.\n\nIf you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.\n\nConquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ii4.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Odyssey"},{"id":0,"name":"Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"}]},{"id":47294,"name":"Money Town","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The fun way to teach kids the value of money. \n \nFun and funds go hand in hand when you put your money where your mouth is- with Money Town, the joy-filled multimedia adventure that teaches your child all the basics about dollars and cents. \n \nAs kids help Greenstreet's coolest characters earn money to reopen their town park, they'll click-and-discover a merry world full of animated money facts, figures, songs and surprises that will send them giggling all the way to the bank.

Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.\n\nL.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.\n\nIn addition to the original full game, L.A.

The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008.\n\nSet during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value.\n\nLeft 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009.\n\nThe popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72na.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Valve","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":47414,"name":"NBA Baller Beats","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Real Ball.

Players must deal with the fallout from the devastating attacks on U.S. and British soil in a storyline that picks up where 2009's Modern Warfare 2 left off. The single-player campaign has you battling Russian ultranationalists, led by Vladimir Markov, as members of the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS. You'll battle across war-torn areas of New York City, London, Paris, Mogadishu, Dubai, and other regions as you prepare to end the global threat once and for all.\n\nAs with previous entries in the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 3's campaign features a heavily scripted, cinematic experience with Hollywood-style special effects. One new mission, for example, has you involved in underwater travel with a sonar-equipped submersible watercraft. You'll then fight inside an enemy-controlled submarine before guiding an inflatable raft across turbulent waters while a naval battle rages nearby. Other sequences have you firing mounted guns, driving vehicles, and more while explosions light up the landscape.\n\nReturning to the game is the cooperative Spec Ops mode that features a series of standalone missions on different maps. New to Spec Ops is a survival option that has you and either a friend or a computer partner battling waves of enemy forces. Shooting down enemies earns you cash, which can be used to purchase new perks, items, weapons, and other upgrades. You'll also be able to earn bonuses by working together as a team and maintaining kill streaks.\n\nThe heart of the game is once again the 18-player online component, which introduces all-new maps and a variety of enhancements to the format introduced in Modern Warfare 2. Popular features such as kill-streak awards, experience points, weapons-based achievements, and perks return, allowing you to customize your character as you progress. An optional subscription service entitled \"Call of Duty Elite\" will allow players to track detailed statistics such as win-loss records, kill-death ratios, time played, most successful maps, favorite weapons, and much more.\n\nHardened Edition bonus items include a Steelbook case, collectible field journal, special ops juggernaut outfit for your Xbox Live avatar, premium membership to Call of Duty Elite, and special founder status on Call of Duty Elite. Call of Duty Elite's premium membership includes all future downloadable content (DLC) for Modern Warfare 3, of which there are 20 pieces of DLC expected within the first nine months following the game's release.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4a7p.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Infinity Ward","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sledgehammer Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":47426,"name":"Nurarihyon no Mago: Hyakki Ryouran Taisen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Japan","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5tv3.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arc System Works","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":47427,"name":"NCAA Basketball 09: March Madness Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An Xbox Live Arcade exclusive that allows those who have not experianced NCAA Basketball 09 to relive the 2009 NCAA Tournament for fee of 1200 Microsoft Points ($15)","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/q7haqhjemswg4wyr8asm.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":47428,"name":"NBA Unrivaled","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A downloadable arcade-style basketball game that features real teams and players from the 2009-2010 NBA season.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ypinwxlueawcpp5fjilx.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":47429,"name":"Metro: Last Light - Limited Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2013.

Also included is a second DVD that explores the making of Gears of War with lead designer Cliff Bleszinski and his development team.\n\nAnointed by the games media as Microsoft's first \"killer app\" for its Xbox 360, Epic Games' Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.\n\nSince the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them.\n\nA behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5eye.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Epic Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":47452,"name":"Diablo III: Reaper of Souls - Ultimate Evil Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition includes the expansion pack Reaper of Souls and features special four-player co-op features.

It is the second installment of the Gears of War series, with lead design by Cliff Bleszinski,. The game was officially released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine. The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game.\n\nIn Gears of War 2, the COG continues its fight against the Locust horde, who are attempting to sink all of the cities on the planet Sera. Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \"Horde\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \"chainsaw duels\" and the ability to use downed foes as \"meatshields\" were added to the game.\n\nOn its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies. It was the seventh best selling video game of 2009 and received several accolades. The game received similar praise as its predecessor, with the new gameplay and multiplayer modes seen as outstanding additions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5eyc.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Epic Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":47466,"name":"Call of Duty 3: Gold Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Expanding upon Call of Duty 3, the #1 shooter of 2006, Call of Duty 3 GOLD EDITION includes a bonus DVD of exciting content and a key code used to obtain an Xbox Live Marketplace Token for the Call of Duty 3 \"Valor\" Map Pack (consisting of 5 brand new multiplayer maps) for FREE.\n\nThe follow-up to the #1 next-generation game, Call of Duty 3 delivers the intensity of being closer than ever to the fury of combat during the Normandy Breakout, the historic campaign that made the liberation of Paris possible and brought the Allies a step closer to Berlin.
