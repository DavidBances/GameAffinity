The main problem though is the creatures that move around the screen and these have to be avoided or if touched he loses one of four lives. The creatures though can be killed by dropping a block on top of them or allowing them to fall through the gaps. A bird that occasionally appears can be killed if its flight path is blocked. \n \nTo get the blocks to the bottom of the screen there are platforms over gaps and to get a gap Thorak can walk on the platform to remove it then drop blocks through the gap to the level below.

At a certain level in the cave, Thorak can't get back up so he has to make sure he has two blocks to move to the stream.
