Exploring the factory takes players to a variety of locations including the lobby, platform room, atrium, maintenance room, cafeteria, security booth, conference room, elevator, trash room, pipe room, tentacle room, contamination room, R&D lab, pressure control room, locker room, mailroom and more.\n\nDuring the adventure, players interact with characters from the film, including Delta, Boo, Fran, Smitty, Needleman, Skip, and Wally. In addition to solving puzzles, kids are required to complete simple tasks like finishing Mike's paperwork, exploring every room in the factory to find joke cards, and maintaining a small inventory. Joke cards are used by Mike to match specific types of jokes, categorized by sports, animals, science, food, music, family, transportation, school, monsters and clown routines, with certain kids to make them laugh.\n\nUpon completion of the first puzzle, a blueprint becomes available that shows the missing machine parts as well as a list of items that have been found. After Mike rescues Boo early in the game, players gain access to the Cereal Slide mini-game where the goal is to become the first player to line up colored cereal pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally in a row of three (3x3 grid) or four (5x5 or 7x7 grids).

Being a sharp-shooter is what this game needs since the life of your friend depends on how well you target the apple. Every time you hit the apple, the distance between you and your friend will be farther. Also, there will be some sort of a barricade to make the difficulty more advanced. Your friend's life is at risk. There's no room for mistakes so be brave and be sharp enough to target the apple and try not to kill your dear friend. Take your time in controlling the power and direction of the bow to perfect the shot and save your friend.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4rur.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":202249,"name":"Dreams of Dead","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dreams of Dead is a Russian Yume Nikki fangame.
