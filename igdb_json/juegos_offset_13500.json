With a back catalog of several installments of the then-leading world atlas and almanac software, PC Globe, the company turned snippets of country-specific info into an educational game that mixed two-player “Identify that place” strategy with a “Get to know the globe” learning effect – can you say Carmen Sandiego? \n \nAs the sinister Otto von Slinkenrat tries to pocket the world’s treasures in his private collection, renowned adventurer Bush Buck sets out to find and secure the valuable objects for posterity. In a race around the globe, you and an opponent travel back and forth between 206 cities in 175 countries in search for clues to the treasures’ whereabouts. Cities are connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background info – e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture. \n \nLearning to place countries and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features of the target country and town which help narrow down your options – e.g. “It’s an island country”, “It’s in East Asia” etc. The first player to visit the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base for a points reward. \n \nFor each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400 possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe trotters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jgw0vqv3gzh3lzlwtxtp.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":14357,"name":"Apocalypse Neighbors","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Apocalypse Neighbors is a 2D strategy game with turn-based artillery combat and construction.\n\nThe Devil Man has sent forth his demons across ‘Murica and they’ve corrupted your neighbours, the only solution?

The object of the game is to make your pieces constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by converting as many of your opponent's pieces as possible.\n\nEach player begins with two pieces, white and black, for the first player and second player respectively. The game starts with the four pieces on the four corners of the board, with white in the top left and bottom right and black on the other two. White moves first.\n\nDuring their turn, players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction. Diagonal distances are equivalent to orthogonal distances, e.g. it is legal to move to a square whose relative position is two squares away both vertically and horizontally. If the destination is adjacent to the source, a new piece is created on the empty departure square. Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination. After the move, all of the opponent player's pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the color of the moving player. Players must move unless no legal move is possible, in which case they must pass.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hssylhesopgfsyh14phx.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":14481,"name":"Oh No!

In our effort to save the Confederation from the depredations of the Kilrathi, we can only afford to send the very best pilots out to defend our homes. Innumerable hours of training, classes and simulator practice turn our students into ace Confederation pilots before they launch their first actual mission. In my opinion, the tcsn flight simulator is by far the most important educational tool this academy has to offer. The simulator will not only teach you how to fly, but more importantly it will show you how to survive. In the countless simulated missions you embark on during this part of your training, you will fight Kilrathi ships and Kilrathi pilots in hijacked Confederation ships.\n\nYou will endeavor to blow enemy capital ships out of space and defend your own space station against attacking forces. Since the simulator is programmed to realistically imitate real conditions in space, it will also teach you how to effectively navigate asteroid and mine fields and retrieve ejected pilots or data capsules from space. The TCSN flight simulator will show you what you really came here to learn. Use it wisely, and the lessons you learn at this console will save your life when you actually face a swarm of Kilrathi in a grueling dogfight.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3gvs.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Origin Systems","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":14485,"name":"Neuromancer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based on the cyberpunk novel by William Gibson.
