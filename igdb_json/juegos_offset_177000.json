The world is navigated using an overworld map using point-to-point navigation, with a date system showing the length of time it takes to get to a selected location. Alongside the story missions, Towns can be visited, in which characters can customize and create new weapons and armor, sell existing equipment in exchange for money, and shop for items such as healing potions. In camps set up on a journey, characters can swap out weapons and armor, equip items such as healing potions and beneficial charms for future battles. Special items used in character leveling can also be crafted by the player. Alongside story-based missions, there is a special dungeon called the Catacomb of Trials, where characters can battle and gain experience levels, raising their general statistics. The number of available levels in the Catacomb increases as players progress through the game. Each character has a specific character class, which they keep throughout the game and continue to level up as they gain experience points (XP). Higher amounts of XP are awarded for executing special abilities. Along with swordsmen and archers, there are alchemists (mages), priests (healers), and units who fight using most things from axes to fists.\n\nMost battles are triggered based on story events, and are completed when the stated object has been accomplished by the player, be it defeating all enemies, defeating a boss, or performing a specific task. At the end of each battle, the players gain a summery of their performance and spoils gained. The game uses the turn-based Replaceable Action Position battle system, much of which was carried over from the battle system used in Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth. Players navigate the field across a grid-based map, which can include obstacles such as bodies of water and high structures. Character positioning within the environment can be used to their advantage, such as an archer gaining higher accuracy when at a high point in the level. Character actions are arranged in a set order, and each character's weapon dictates their attack range. Each time a character performs an action, they gain experience points and additional Skill Points (SP) that can be used to purchase supplies or raise individual character stats. Three types of Skills can be equipped for characters: Action Skills, a special attack that player execute for a certain amount of Magic Points (MP); Support Skills, which grant passive abilities such as scaling higher obstacles; and Zone Skills, which grant passive abilities to both the equipped character and those in close proximity to them.\n\nAlongside Action Skills, two or more characters in conjunction trigger unique special moves called Team Attacks. The amount of damage done depends on how many characters took part in the action. Team attacks also increase the rewards gained at the end of battles. Characters' actions are governed by their stored Action Points (AP): a character's turn begins when their AP meter is at 100. A character's actions can continue until the meter reaches 0, meaning that they can move and attack multiple times within their turn. The amount of AP used with each action depends on the weight of the armor the character is wearing.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5078.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"505 Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atlus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":3985,"name":"Mario Power Tennis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mario Power Tennis features variations of tennis matches consisting of characters, courts, and scenarios based on the Mario series.

Dropped on different parts of the island, Action Man, Redwolf and Flint must first find each other, and then put an end to the evil doctor's plans.\n\nMost of the game's 17 levels take the form of a side-scrolling platformer with a heavy action focus. To get to the level exit, the controlled character must jump pits and gaps, climb ledges and take out many enemies, different varieties of X' robots and various animals native to the island: spiders, bats, even dinosaurs. Each character has slightly different abilities (until the finale, which hero is controlled depends on the level): Native American Redwolf always carries his bow, while Action Man and Flint start most levels with only their fists. They can pick up weapons, though, including throwing discs (for Action Man only), several different guns (which can be further enhanced by timed power-ups) and a boomerang (for Australian Flint only). Only Flint can double jump. Picking up 50 Action Man icons gives an extra life. Regular extra lives and health power-ups are also available, and a reset checkpoint is available every few screens.\n\nVariety from the platform levels comes in two levels where Flint uses his dirt rider and Redwolf surfs the waves. These are seen from behind the heroes as they must avoid or blast away obstacles and collect Action Man icons. Action Man lives up to his name in a level where he rides a motorcycle up a volcano (shooting missiles at enemies and jumping across gaps) and another one where he straps helicopter blades to his back to fly towards the level end.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3gc6.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Magic Pockets","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atari, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":305118,"name":"Sex Kitten Sim-Date 4","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Our hero (you) is on another sexually charged quest!

Each character has his/her own attack and can perform combos by pressing certain button combinations, e.g. B + B or A + B + A, and even perform team attacks and a team super attack. As they gain experience they will gain levels and can purchase new moves (combos) or upgrade old ones with experience points.

The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below. One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below. The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you'll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ovv.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega of America","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Europe","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Amuze","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":4101,"name":"Second Sight","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Second Sight is primarily stealth-action, using psychic abilities to stealthily move through levels.
