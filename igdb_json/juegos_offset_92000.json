You’ll climb through dark tunnels to reach mystical mountain temples. You’ll match wits with goblins, ghosts and sentient coffeemakers. You might even save the world from tearing itself apart. \n \nAll you need to get this quest started? A magical phone. Be sure to read the fine print. \n \nThis is Guildlings, a new story-driven episodic adventure brought to you by Asher Vollmer (maker of Threes), IGF award-winner Jamie Antonisse, and the team of dedicated indies at Sirvo Studios. Drawing inspiration from classic RPGs, point and click puzzlers and visual novel games, it tells a lighthearted coming-of-age fantasy tale within a modern mobile frame. \n \nFeatures: \n- Traverse hand-crafted low-poly environments, including floating ruins, a tavern built from a shipwrecked boat, and the mountaintop teen hangout known as “Makeout Temple”. \n- Use a text-message inspired chat system to make conversations and choices. Characters will react to your decisions in satisfying (and sometimes hilarious) ways. \n- Leverage your Guild members’ abilities in playful turn-based combat. Each Guildling has a unique set of powers tied to their personality. \n- Affect the world around you through your Guildmaster magic. A single touch can unlock doors, open treasure chests, or even blow up your dad’s favorite lamp. \n- Guildlings’ magic powers are tied to their moods. This system ties conversation, exploration and combat together. Keeping your team happy will make your journey easier, but sometimes a little drama will take the story to interesting places… \n \nIf you’ve read this far already, what are you waiting for? Boot up your Tome, meet your new best friends, and become their Guildmaster. Worldaria awaits.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tskhzh1z32er6c1q4jdg.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sirvo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":19564,"name":"Death Stranding","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"From legendary game creator Hideo Kojima comes an all-new, genre-defying open world action adventure, starring Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux and Lindsay Wagner.
