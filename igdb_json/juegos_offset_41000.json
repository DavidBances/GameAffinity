The plane starts equipped with a limited double-shot machine gun that can be slowly upgraded throughout the game by collecting power-pods left behind by small trucks.

You're a member of the elite Debuggers, a group of warriors who are jacks-of- all-trades. Assigned to inspect an unmanned space station, you have exactly 100 minutes to get in, destroy the monsters lurking in each block, make your way to the lowest level and deactivate the automatic detonator placed there. With each monster that slips by you, the core block becomes harder to survive in, so speed is key in preserving the facility and each separate block. Experience the thrill of survival as the timer ticks away and you uncover the truth of the events that occurred.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co91pq.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"G-mode","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NEC","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Data East","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":44344,"name":"Project Nebula","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A blockchain based game of interstellar exploration!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dou.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ICON Forge","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":44345,"name":"Popcorn","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The object of this game is to use your paddles to catch as many of the falling popcorn kernels as possible, before they hit the bottom of the popper.

Math permeates every aspect of our lives — work, relaxation, entertainment. Its importance in the future to us and especially to our children will be even greater. Therefore, it is essential for all of us to know and understand how fundamental mathematics operations are performed. In order to develop this understanding, students must have the opportunity to practice, for only through practice can they develop strong mathematical skills. The Computer Math Games VI Solid State Cartridge is one of five modules of math games that can help provide this opportunity. The program was designed by Charles Lund, Supervisor of Mathematics for the St. Paul, Minnesota, public schools and the staff of Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in cooperation with the staff of Texas Instruments Incorporated. The games included in the cartridge are both fun and challenging, with an entertaining, motivating format designed to capture and hold attention. With this cartridge students will be able to: \n- develop math skills by playing four different, enjoyable math games using whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and integers. \n- have fun while practicing mathematics either alone or with other players or team members. \n- develop methods of problem-solving and decision-making. \nThe cartridge is designed to be versatile. It can be used in the home as well as the classroom. The team-use concept allows the cartridge to be used by large numbers of participants, and yet it is equally valuable to your child working alone at home to supplement lectures and homework. The cartridge is intended to be a supplementary aid for children from grades two through nine. It is assumed that the students have been exposed to basic math concepts. While even very young students can use the activities covering addition and subtraction of whole numbers, the cartridge can grow in application as your child grows in ability.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44358,"name":"Computer Math Games II","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44359,"name":"Bomber","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bomb away the Skyscrapers to form a runway, before you crash.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ifqcmc6isctmws2hyg1t.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44360,"name":"Reading Fun","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44361,"name":"Reading Roundup","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":44362,"name":"Rotor Raiders","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rotor Raiders is a game very similar to Pac-Man where instead of you are on cleanup.

The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University. \n \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level. \n \nThe main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of \"moves\" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results. \n \nObstacles in levels include: \n \nBoxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled. \nGlass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through. \nLaser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level. \nSwitch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them. \nTeleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points. \nPolice officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior. \nDetectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles. \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a \"weekly quiz\" that can be downloaded through the Internet.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2hhw.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":44507,"name":"NeoGeo Heroes Ultimate Shooting","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"10 great SNK heroes and heroines have left their worlds to answer Dr. Brown Sugar's \"call for peace\".
