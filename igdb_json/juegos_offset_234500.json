After her father's death she took over the business, much to the disapproval of some employees and relatives. She's also a former model and has been recently divorced from a famous pop star. This means there are a lot of suspects around...\n\nThe player takes the role of the supervisor and never leaves his office - exceptions are the interrogations which he is also responsible for; his two assistants are specialised in forensics and general investigations. The player gives his orders by stamping fields on the various info sheets, e.g. to to execute a search warrant he opens the house sheet and drags & drops the stamp on the corresponding field. After a short while he receives the results in an e-mail - every time new information arrive these can be directly accessed by clicking on a symbol in the upper left corner.\n\nThe player also has four other tools to his disposal which help him solving the case. The phone is used to call three people: The managing inspector who gives hints when stuck, the district attorney to receive search warrants and a journalist who can give important additional information. A special board is dedicated to show the relationships of all suspects to the victim or to each other. Here the player also orders the surveillance of a suspect. The computer has a timeline of the crime saved which is used to find discrepancies in the statements of the suspects and unaccounted time. Finally the map shows all locations which are relevant to the investigation.\n\nBefore the interrogations the player has to choose up to three topics. He often has the choice between a nice and a confrontational statement. While the latter may bring more information it can also offend the suspect and lead him to stop the conversation. It is, however, not possible to get stuck because of that.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6mny.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Pan Vision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":253554,"name":"Quintus and the Formidable Curse","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"‘Quintus and the Formidable Curse’ is a Horror-Adventure game with a difference; the protagonists are a Man and Mouse duo!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6mo0.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Wreck Tangle Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":253555,"name":"Bucky's Grounds","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bucky's Grounds is a first-person Retro style mascot horror game, where you uncover the dark truth of a mysterious town within another dimension, visit the Khancoban playground while avoiding the sweet toothed rabbit who despises yellow light.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6mo1.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":253556,"name":"Home: A Story of Light","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Home: A Story of Light is a narrative-driven point and click adventure game that follows Grayson, the son of a great inventor.

This monitor displays the user interface for individual stations, simulating the borders of the display with on-screen graphics while single-player games are in operation. Players can also partake in cooperative battles, during which the interface is expanded to cover both stations.
