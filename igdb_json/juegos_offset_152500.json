The machines are also available in Taiwan in Traditional Chinese and in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Hong Kong in English.\n\nLike its predecessor, Pokémon Tretta focuses on three-on-three Pokémon battles that require special tiles, called Tretta, that depict one of the various Pokémon species in order to play.

Pokémon caught in-game are dispensed for players to use in other battles, or to add to their collection.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6n04.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Takara Tomy Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Marvelous AQL","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":91076,"name":"123 Kids Fun Education","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Learning Games – 123 Kids Fun Education including counting, colors, geometry, alphabet, math, numbers, shapes sorting, patterns, puzzles, learn to read letters.\n\n123 Kids Fun Education is a collection of 15 entertaining educational games for your preschoolers!

The player's behavior does determine the mental health of the main character and change locations and unveil new secrets leading to different endings.\n\nOn 13 April 2013, the Extended Edition was released which added new environments, puzzles, user interface, music, improved graphics, and a new character.\n\nPLOT:\nThe storyline of Anna concerns an amnesiac man who dreams of a sawmill in the mountains near his town. He decides to go there to find out its connection to his missing memories and a woman named \"Anna\" who seems to be calling out for him, and enters the house by solving puzzles in the garden. He becomes aware that the house is haunted after seeing several strange phenomena.\n\nAs the protagonist explores, he begins to hear voices belonging to himself and the eponymous Anna, among others. Through these voices and texts found throughout the sawmill, he discovers that he has had an obsessive history with an ancient deity named Anna that he had since forgotten. However, the plot is ambiguous from this point; one interpretation holds that in times of yore, Anna would lure men into worship, causing them to murder those close to them or starve themselves at the feet of her statue, and after she seduced the protagonist, he murdered his own wife and children for threatening his relationship with Anna. The other interpretation paints the protagonist as the villain, meeting a human avatar of Anna in the forest and falling in love with her. However, after she left because of his obsession with her and abusive personality, he sacrificed children to summon her again.\n\nThe game has three main endings; in an inversion of the norm, the more effort that is put into achieving an ending, the less optimistic the conclusion will be. In the first scenario, the protagonist concludes that Anna was burnt as a witch centuries ago and leaves the house, vowing never to return. In the second ending, the protagonist reminisces about Anna, realizes that he cannot live without her, and opens himself up to possession by her, joining the multitude of mannequins that are found throughout the house. In the third ending, the protagonist remembers killing his real wife after she defiled Anna's statue, and finds the statue, along with dolls of his children, in a small chamber. As the tunnel to the chamber caves in, he realizes that he will stay in the chamber forever, but he does not care because he has \"Anna\" with him.\n\nThe plot is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of the protagonist as to whether or not the sawmill is real or merely a dream, as well as the strange phenomena that occur throughout the story and the vague and unconnected nature of the voices.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nDreampainters, the development studio, based the story on legends from the Val D'Ayas region of Italy, particularly one about a sawmill where a lumberjack killed his family. They claimed that the game's focus was on mystery-solving and exploration, with the player being able to discover the plot at their own pace. One of Anna's particularly infamous features, the ability to pick up any object (no matter if it will be used later on in the game), was apparently based on the developers' hatred for adventure games and cartoons where the important objects were made more obvious to the viewer.\n\nAnna would reportedly have a feature whereby the game would interpret the player's actions to try and scare them; for example, if a player focused on a particular object for too long, that object would appear more often. However, no such feature appeared in the game. Dreampainters also claimed that the extent of the protagonist's descent into madness would determine the ending, but the ending was actually determined by when the player decided to leave the sawmill.\n\nRECEPTION:\nAnna received mixed reviews from critics. The graphics, story and sound were praised, but it was criticized for the obscurity of its narrative, complexity of its interface, and difficulty of its puzzles. The horror elements were both praised and criticized by different reviews; IGN said that the lack of death removed any sense of threat, while Zero Punctuation praised the horror but claimed the immersion was broken by the necessity of a walkthrough. It received a score of 49.13% on GameRankings and 55/100 on Metacritic.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8izk.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreampainters Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kalypso Media","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":309577,"name":"Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8jrk.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Behaviour Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":221666,"name":"Crack Life","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Crack Life was made from total boredom.

When you play Samsara, you pick a hero from a classic FPS game, spawn in the battlefield with abilities and weapons from their original game, and then proceed to lay waste among all those that stand in your way in whatever iwad or levelset of your choice. Each of the heroes are strictly limited to their own weapons, so you won't have a nonsensical random mash-up of people wielding weapons just not suited for them.\nWant to play in Heretic? No problem. Give Chex Quest a whirl? Go right ahead. Wanted to like HeXen but didn't like the low amount of weapons? Go on, enjoy it. Want to go strictly vanilla and play Doom II? Be my guest. Current iwads supported are Doom, Doom II/TNT/Plutonia, Heretic, HeXen, Chex Quest, Strife, and Harmony, and more are to come.\n\nThe goal of Samsara is threefold:\n1: To provide an interesting competitive mod that will enhance, rather than break, deathmatch/capture the flag/etc play. While obviously nothing will match pure vanilla for srs tourney play, if desired one can have a match full of Doomguys and have little to no differences from vanilla play--and someone joining in as Corvus should not dramatically change things.\n2: To stay true to the spirit of classic FPSes by presenting these characters with as close to their original abilities and weapons as reasonably possible. Playing with them should be very much like playing their original game.\n3: To provide a fun experience complimentary with many other levelsets, be they cooperative or competitive, so that people can live as their favorite heroes once again and put them through wringers so many other inventive people have designed. Other heroes should not differ so drastically from Doom II that other mods would now be unplayable.\n\nWhether you play in co-op and tear through endless hordes of monsters or play in deathmatch and tear through whatever friends or enemies challenge you, Samsara offers you the ability to live through your favorite games again on new battlefields or new iwads entirely.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4n6d.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"TerminusEst13","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":52983,"name":"Eternal Journey: New Atlantis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Eternal Journey: New Atlantis is a casual hidden object game developed by Five-BN and published by Alawar Entertainment for the Mac and Windows.

The arsenal consists of single or dual pistols, shotguns, machine guns, shotguns and other items such as a scope, dynamite and boiler plates. Weapons can be found by picking them off dead players or through the in-game buy menu. Cash for the weapons is earned by killing players or by collecting it in the level where it respawns regularly. Through the same menu, ammunition can be bought. \n \nThe levels often offer a stealth approach, hiding behind crates or shooting through windows that can break. Weapons can only contain a small amount of bullets (unless an additional ammo belt is bought) and need to be reloaded regularly. Different body parts can be targeted for different damage and when hit players notice a small slowdown in movement. \n \nSingleplayer is also available with all the team modes, but with the same maps and game modes to be played against bots with customizable skill levels. It is also possible to play a game with a handicap to even the odds.
