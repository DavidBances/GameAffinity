Extra care has been put into making everything have punch and impact and be fun to use but not the level of overkill.

Most notably, cancelling an action during combat (e.g. pressing B at magic spell selection, or selecting Magic on a character that is not capable of casting spells) will not forfeit that character’s turn. It is still possible to pass a turn by pressing B before selecting any action.\n\nMany aspect of the gameplay have been slightly altered to make grinding at lower levels unnecessary, and level progression more rewarding. Defeating monsters found in more dangerous locations such as dungeons is also more rewarding as it provides better loot and more XP.\n\nThe combat AI has also been improved, and changes have been introduced to better differentiate the 11 professions and 5 races, including “special abilities” such as critical hits for high level Thieves and extra melee damage for Barbarians.\n\nAlmost all the enemies that were present in the computer versions of the game have been added, including Chests (only in Castle Death), Wizards and the Orcus.\n\nNumerous typos and inconsistencies in the game’s text/dialogues have also been fixed, and many dialogue lines that were present but not accessible in the original release have been re-instated.
