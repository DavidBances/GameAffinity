Symptoms such as anxiety, increased heart rate and shivering will occur. This game is not for the sensitive type, but for those who are willing to explore the facets of fear!       \n       \nTHE LEGEND       \nThe Wendigo is a savage predator that craves human flesh and prefers to eats its victims alive. It's cursed to roam the tribal grounds of North America and is part of the traditional belief system of a number of Algonquin-speaking peoples. Although we don't know where it came from and descriptions can vary, one thing is certain: it is evil, cannibalistic, has an unending hunger and won't be satisfied after killing and consuming one victim.       \n       \nThis creature is intelligent, agile, possesses supernatural strength, has enhanced senses and excels in stealth. The combination of these abilities allows it to stalk its victims without being noticed and once it has you in sight it's probably already too late.       \n       \nCONTROLS       \nFor the best experience we advise to play Seeking Evil while standing. In the case that you prefer to play it while seated it’s strongly recommended to use a non-vr controller or the good old keyboard and mouse set-up.         \n       \nControls for keyboard and non-vr controllers are really straight-forward, but how will Seeking Evil: The Wendigo be played in VR? Let’s have a look:       \n       \nTo ensure a more immersive experience Seeking Evil doesn't rely on a point teleportation system for locomotion and the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller are used.       \n       \nIn order to sprint you can press the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller. There will also be situations where you’re chased by the Wendigo, here shaking the vr controllers as if you were running will allow you to increase your speed even more which might be a matter of life or death.       \n       \nSince using stealth is important to succeed in burning all the totems; sometimes ducking will be advised to hide from the Wendigo.        \n       \nFinally there are also a couple handheld items which can be easily picked up by aiming your hand towards an item which will then snap to your hand. Once an item is picked up it can be mounted on your belt for later use.       \n       \nGAMEPLAY       \nYou'll find yourself stranded in the creepy forests of North America. Things might seem peaceful, but don't be fooled as these grounds are cursed. To break the curse you'll need to find and burn nine totems. That's only the beginning since these haunted forests are home to a legendary creature called The Wendigo. This bloodthirsty predator is fast, smart, has great senses and will do everything it can to eat you alive.        \n       \nYou'll have to combine stealth with tactical timing to outsmart the Wendigo. Oh, and when it attacks, don't be a hero ... just RUN!\"","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co24s0.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Copybugpaste","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":28149,"name":"Spellwrath","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Spellwrath, you assume leadership of one of the six medieval kingdoms on the magical continent of Eyja.      \n      \nExpand your castles, train your knights and take control of your enemies domain in this turn-based strategy RPG!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dyhjvrkruurx07c95zab.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":28150,"name":"Vanish","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"VANISH Is A Free Indie Horror Game That Will Truly Question Your Own Sanity \n \nThrown into a Labyrinth for reasons unknown, you must roam through the darkness to find your escape.

The game resolves around a series of escalating wars during a time known as Warscape, and the hostilities between ten races and two factions: The Arbiters and the 2nd Legion. \n  \nOn the planet of Uloff, ten different races grow hostilities between one another, especially the two major races: the Humans and the Jaar. However, after the assassination of the Human king, the Humans believe that the Jaar are responsible for their leader's death and form a faction with their allying races: The Elves, Jin'tulu, and Dryads; forming the faction known as The Arbiters. The Jaar take this as a declaration of war, and form their own faction with their allies, the Gnomes, Dark Elves, and Orcs, which became known as the 2nd Legion. These two factions both believe that the other is the aggressor, and desire to kill all of those who are affiliated with them. And so, the Great War begins. \n  \nThe war between the two factions causes massive destruction, slaughtering of innocents, and hatred throughout the planet of Uloff. The two faction leaders, King Earnet of the Arbiters and Warlord Bjorin of the 2nd Legion, decide that they will not win the war without a game-changing asset. They then realize that an individual known as the Faction Champion could change the war, and both leaders call in new recruits in order to test and train to see which one will be worthy to become the Faction Champion. The leaders also hope that this individual will bring an end to the death, destruction, and hatred of the Warscape, and lead their faction to victory.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2sam.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ILMXStudios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":28210,"name":"Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades Edition is a complete edition of Dark Souls III, released in April 2017.

The bundle features over 20 hours of terrifying gameplay across Outlast 1, Outlast Whistleblower and the all new Outlast 2.\n\nThe protagonists of Outlast have no fighting abilities. They must run, hide or die. Their only weapon is a camcorder they must use to capture the horrible events unfolding as they progress through the game. The camcorder also has a night vision mode to navigate through dark environments.\n\nIn Outlast 2 you are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe.\n\nThe investigation has led you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co52vr.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":28231,"name":"Memento Mori","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Colonel Ostankovich, the commander of a special police department in St Petersburg, and the man who put his honesty at stake by swearing that under his command not an item will get lost in the Hermitage, receives a report of a short alarm failure in the Hermitage.

Gribbly Grobbly is your typical Blabgorian, and is tasked with the safety of the 'gribblets'. 'Gribblets' are infant Blabgorians; they have an armoured shell to protect them, but when flipped on their backs they expose their vulnerable belly and are unable to right themselves. They also have an annoying tendency to leave the safety of home in search of adventure. Unfortunately Blabgor is not a safe place; there are hordes of beasts roaming the landscape, eagerly searching for vulnerable Gribblets. \n \nThe basic premise for the game required the player to control Gribbly and navigate him through each of the 16 surreal 8-way scrolling landscapes in an attempt to locate and rescue eight baby Gribblets and returning them to the safety of the home cave. Gribbly can hop and levitate around each of the levels and can blow bubbles to defend himself. Once a Gribblet is located, Gribbly can pick up the hapless offspring and carry it to safety. Once only a single Gribblet remains on a level, the energy web fails, freeing Seon. This usually results in a mad rush to get the remaining Gribblet to safety before succumbing to his attacks. Once all the Gribblets are either saved or killed, the level ends and Gribbly is transported to the next level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cwqxrgc2scmq9o3rfjdx.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hewson Consultants","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Graftgold","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":28475,"name":"3D Space Wars","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"3D Space Wars is an action game for both the ZX Spectrum and the Dragon 32/64","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zzwojkwepf8hsgj5nn6i.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hewson Consultants","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ST Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"TRS-80 Color Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Dragon 32/64"}]},{"id":28476,"name":"3D Lunattack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You attack a moonbase of the dreaded Seiddabs.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/udv2xdd6fc0x2gp5a22g.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ST Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hewson Consultants","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Dragon 32/64"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":28477,"name":"3D Seiddab Attack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Seiddab Trilogy is a series of video games designed by Steve Turner (as Graftgold) for the ZX Spectrum and published by Hewson Consultants.

They communicated with Sean and Steve to understand the memory layout for the levels and then set out to create an advanced construction set better than the one included with the original game. Among other things, their construction set included the ability to create \"treasure matrices\" that allowed the user to create special effects similar to the ones seen in the main levels. The original set had remnants in its code alluding to features that had been disabled, likely due to their instability or lack of documentation.\n\nPP&S took the code from Craig and Aaron, and released it commercially in a package called the Wizard Expansion Set. This add-on pack also included 50 new levels from a competition held by the company specifically for the expansion; none of the new levels had any advanced features because of the limitations of the original construction set.\n\nElectronic Arts, including Paul Reiche III, used the Construction set created by Aaron and Craig to create a new set of levels. The Construction Set was also included by EA, as were a combination of levels from the original game and from the expansion pack, albeit in a different order from the original PP&S releases. The Ultimate Wizard version also featured some changes to existing levels to increase their difficulty, as well as different sprites for some of the game's monsters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/cw3dlsbtkgbmqfimzzhi.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Progressive Peripherals & Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]}]
