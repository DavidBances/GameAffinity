The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off.\n\nThe aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix.\n\nTo start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time.

Roll around the cube to capture items by color, fruit, or pattern matching, collect coins, execute combos by rapidly capturing objects, fruit, pac-men, etc., unlock exciting themes, and level-up the stack to trump the Google leaderboard. \n \nThe game features new never seen before design and controls that are intuitive, and addictive. It is designed to challenge the players mind and eye-hand coordination incrementally, making the game harder as the player level's up. The only way through is up and up! \n \nCurrent available themes are: \n \n★ Classic default theme that reminds players of the RUBIK cube, but with more challenging and fast than the old RUBIK! A simple Monument to mash your cubes on! Mr. Rubik would certainly be proud. \n \n★ Beautiful Grapevine theme featuring juicy squishy FRUIT! Squishing grapes is definitely more fun than slashing fruit! Great theme for casual Fruit squishing and juicing when you're looking for some fruity fun on the Play Store. \n \n★ A PAC-CUBE theme with a cubic version of the infamous PAC-MAN himself, and of course the four ghosts! PAC-CUBE was never so much fun! If you have played the awesome pacman game, you will love the theme! Also features a beautiful model of the Atari 2600. Pacman never felt so awesome! \n \nFeatures clean Monument Valley and Stack style isometric design. Difficulty increases gradually with each level-up, making it harder yet more fun as you go through this endless puzzle challenge. The simple, clean graphics, pretty little \"Monuments\", and the fluid gameplay will keep you engaged for hours. Explore exciting achievements and challenges... and more coming soon! The fun is MONUMENT-AL! \n \nYour comments and valuable suggestions are welcome to enhance the game experience.

Also some settlements are ruled at certain times by independent rulers, e.g. Tortuga and Belize. These settlements can be attacked by the player, meaning his crew, with weapons the player chose, will land at the town and can then be controlled to burn and pillage it. Other than this the player controls a ship unit upon a map of the Spanish Main and can plot courses to pins which represent towns; however, if an NPC ship is close enough to the player (these ships spawn at the settlements with goals such as trade between towns or to find pirates), the player will be alerted and go into a smaller bird's-eye map in which they can raise flags to either enter diplomacy with the ship such as asking for information, raise nation flags to avoid them, or obviously raise the Jolly Roger to attack them. Ship combat is worked much as town combat with the player controlling his ship(s) with advanced controls such as where to aim cannon, and what type of shot, right down to scuttling the ship or setting it ablaze.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nulhakg2eoiv9lor27wb.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":26185,"name":"Grid 2: Reloaded Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Be fast, be first and be famous in GRID 2 Reloaded, featuring the full GRID 2 game expanded with over $35 worth of additional content including two new circuits - legendary Spa and fearsome Bathurst - and 25 extra cars playable in split-screen, online and career mode.

Eventually you come to grasp the power of your influence: where you pass, things change faster to the better, and locals that you have met increasingly demand openness from their governments.

It was first released in the United Kingdom for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Atari 8-bit home computers in 1985. It was later released in France by ERE Informatique in 1986, and was released in the United States by Datasoft later that year. It was also ported to the Tatung Einstein home computer in 1989, exclusively in the United Kingdom. It is the fifth instalment of the Strategic Wargames series. \n \nThe game is set during a fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, in which both sides use nuclear and chemical weapons against each other. The main objective of the game is to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code. \n \nDuring development, the developers obtained extensive information and statistics of military strength from the Ministry of Defence and the Soviet embassy in London. Theatre Europe gained national controversy upon release, receiving criticism from both the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and The Sun newspaper.

Instead, you navigate sites in, around and under Paris, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to solve puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to lose a life at the merest contact.\n\nThe narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along the way in the transition from high literature to action arcade game and back to crypto-literary interactive fiction, but they take what they've learned about design along the way and present things clearly, possessions and companions continually visually indicated above a baroque text input/output field. The interface is as intuitive as those of the prior games in the franchise, despite the enormous gulf between their respective styles of gameplay.

The latter is performed using speech-bubbles in which the player can type out words and phrases using the keyboard.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4xn3.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Imagine Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":26422,"name":"Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Airheart is a dieselpunk airplane action game, where every colorful level is built on top of the previous one, all the way up to the stratosphere.

Edison Carter is an investigative reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic construct of his mind that was stored after Edison was involved in a motorcycle accident and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a \"Max Headroom\" sign going into a tunnel. Max lives in computers and can appear on any screen, television or any electronic device. The character is actually Matt Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear jittery and stuttering like an early computer model.\n\nIn the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 top floors of their high-rise building starting at the 200th floor. Security systems protect each floor and you have to find and enter the correct codes to gain access from the elevators. Each floor seen in isometric view, has lines representing walls of various rooms with doors and office furniture. Robots will chase and fire at you and decrease your health level as shown on the biomonitor at bottom of screen. Also indicated are the floor number and time left.

Jones (Theora helps you hack into systems) to show you the floor and computer circuits.\n\nWhen entering a security code, it takes the form of an LED digit over which you must move a pointer over a row of circuit lines in order to activate various segments to form a desired digit. Each segment will remain lit only temporarily so when time runs out you must ensure that the letter is fully lit or your code will fail. In that event, you must make your way across the floor to the second elevator and try again.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/uwu02rol5bwbcrtfcroq.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Binary Design, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Quicksilva Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":26437,"name":"Knight Games","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A medieval multi-event competition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/i1lpuzdhdvsbcoaghcf3.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mastertronic","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The English Software Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":26438,"name":"West Bank","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co50jj.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Dinamic Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26439,"name":"Atelier Marie: The Alchemist of Salburg","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The game that started the Atelier franchise.\nHas never been released outside Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2v5h.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gust","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":26440,"name":"Atelier Elie: The Alchemist of Salburg 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second game in the Atelier series.\nOriginally for the PlayStation the game has been released for the PS3, PSP, and PS Vita through the PlayStation Network.\nThe game has only been released in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ym1.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gust","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":26441,"name":"Atelier Lilie: The Alchemist of Salburg 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The third game in the Atelier series and last in the Salburg trilogy.

There are many houses in the camp, which have many rooms containing useful items, but you won't be able to get them all because of the time limit for the operation.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mlq83ozztnhmdhmuagqz.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"U.S. Gold","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mindscape, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Chris Gray Enterprises Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26456,"name":"Mallows","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This is the game where the Mallows are.\r\nA challenging game about tapping marshmallows to save them from a campfire.\r\nYou'll have 3 lifes, so it won't be easy.\r\nA casual game for the moments in which you have to be patient and wait for something important.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/yhbzmxal0c6dfkctp48o.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":26457,"name":"Batman","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Batman is a 1986 3D isometric action-adventure game by Ocean Software for the Amstrad PCW, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, and MSX and MSX2 microcomputers, and the first Batman game ever developed.

The player takes the role of an ambitious citizen who wants to become the mayor of Lübeck.

This means the current salt price is the most important part when planning shipments (besides the weather). Of course the player also has to purchase and maintain other things, e.g. a trading station, ships and cannons. Alternatively the player can also participate in smuggling.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8iv4.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"arioloasoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":26459,"name":"Spindizzy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As GERALD (Gyroscopic ExploRAtion Landing Device) you must explore 385 screens of Hangworld, using limited fuel.
