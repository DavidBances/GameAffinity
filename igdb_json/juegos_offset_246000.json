As a student the player has to take classes and each class is represented by a certain mini game that is played with the remote controller. The game is divided into three years and for each year the player has to complete three classes to reach the year-end challenge and then advance to the next year. Ultimately after all three years it's possible to win tickets for the Quidditch World Cup. In addition to classes there are also additional mini-games called extracurricular activities that are unlocked as classes are completed.\n\nThe game can be played both alone or against up to three other human players. Each player then chooses one of the four houses at Hogwarts and compete against each other in trying to get the highest score. It is possible to customize the difficulty for each player and there is also a mystery wand option where the difficulty level changes depending on how well the player is doing.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72dv.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DVD Player"}]},{"id":266196,"name":"Harry Potter DVD Game: Wizarding World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A sequel to Hogwarts Challenge based on the fourth, fifth, and sixth Harry Potter movies.
