Nestled deep within is a small rocky pinnacle upon which rests the palace of The Guardian, the architect of the Vault of Knowledge.\n\nFor centuries people have visited the Guardian hoping for blessings and the chance to take the Trial of Knowledge but few have been granted the wish. After many wars and natural disasters the location of The Guardian eventually slipped from people's memories and was lost forever from maps. Only legends remain telling of the trial and the strange machines that seem to crackle with the power of the skies.\n\nFor years you have dreamt of finding the Vault and gaining the treasure of the ancients but the mountain paths have just led you round in circles. One day, while searching the northwest mountain peaks, you discovered a hidden trail marked with small piles of stones covered in unusual symbols. Something looks familiar and you suspect you have seen these symbols before in ancient books, but your memory is fading and you are not sure anymore.\n\nAfter days of walking past countless marker stones, the trail eventually descended from the higher peaks towards a misty valley. Far off in the distance you could see a small hill with what seemed to be a man made structure on the top but you will need to get closer to find out.\n\nThe trail leads down into a dense forest shrouded in a thick miasma that chills you to the bone. The boughs creak and groan but there is no wind, just the fog blocking out the light above. Several days pass and eventually the winding trail leads upwards again, out of the mist. You stand before a small ornate building with glass on all sides.\n\nYou enter the main door...","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ntr.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":71352,"name":"Delaware St. John: Volume 3 - The Seacliff Tragedy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sound of a hundred voices call to Delaware St. John and lead him to the site of a decrepit amusement park.

Some characters can be talked to and the player then has to choose the dialogue option that will please the character. For each puzzle solved the player earns points.

As the drama and battle unfold, you will experience stories of friendship, love and growing pains during a time of war and revolution.\n\nThe 'CANVAS' engine originally developed by SEGA Game Studios Japan for Valkyria Chronicles has been fully redesigned for the PSP system. This incredibly distinctive engine will power over 20 new distinct and visually stunning environments where you will have over 200 different missions to explore. For the first time ad-hoc Versus and Co-op multiplayer gameplay will now be available. The 'BLiTZ' battle system has also been re-designed to offer players the freedom to strategically move around the environment and attack enemies using real-time controls, something never before seen in the tactical role-playing game genre.\n\nThis game adds some new unit classes and the ability to upgrade or change classes.
