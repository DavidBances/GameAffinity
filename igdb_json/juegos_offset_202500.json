Two modes are present in the game - \"Pacman Story\" and \"Floor Exercise\" - with Pac-Man only appearing in the former.\n\nPacman Story features the Pac-Land incarnations of various characters, fully animated, as the tilepieces. Upon completing a level it shows an intermission, featuring a zoomed-in Pac-Man character that is identical to the regular tile(s). After thirty levels, the game ends, displaying the credits. The Floor Exercise mode is incomplete and impossible to finish; instead of Pac-Man tiles, it features generic slot machine graphics. In place of Pacman Story's intermissions, Floor Exercise also has bonus rounds, featuring a large puzzle of a girl lifting weights.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5bfu.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":218451,"name":"Century: Age of Ashes - Stormraiser Premium Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":218452,"name":"Toree's 3D Platformer Collection","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Toree and his friends invite you to jump through four colourful and varied 3d platformer games.
