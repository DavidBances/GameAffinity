A fireworks event (also called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics) is a display of the effects produced by firework devices. Fireworks competitions are also regularly held at a number of places. Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light, smoke and floating materials (confetti for example.) They may be designed to burn with flames and sparks of many colors, typically red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, , silver and gold. Displays are common throughout the world and are the focal point of many cultural and religious celebrations.\n\nDuring the summer in Japan, fireworks festivals are held nearly every day someplace in the country, in total numbering more than 200 during August. The festivals consist of large fireworks shows, the largest of which use between 100,000 and 120,000 rounds (PL Art of Fireworks), and can attract more than 800,000 spectators. Street vendors set up stalls to sell various drinks and staple Japanese food (such as Yakisoba, Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki, kakigori (shaved ice), and traditionally held festival games, such as Kingyo-sukui, or Goldfish scooping.\n\nHanabi Shokunin ninarou 2 is a fireworks simulator.

Hanabi Shokunin Ninarou 2 features a wide assortment of fireworks to design, view, edit and experience on the PS2. Common sorts such as radial explosions and spherical blasts are fairly easy to create but elaborate fireworks may also be crafted which show complete figures, scenes and other elaborate sky theater.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7hly.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Magical Company","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":279783,"name":"Toree Jolly Jam","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Toree Jolly Jam is a short little, speed based, one level 3D Platformer, in a wintery holiday coating, that rewards the player with certain goodies.
