Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition.\n\nWhen engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds.\n\nThroughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world.

Players will explore five strange new lands that hold unimagined treasures for those brave and skilled enough to claim them. Battle and conquest are also important ingredients in a pirate's lifestyle and combat takes place both on land and on the high seas. The player's character is quick with a sword and can increase her swashbuckling skills with experience.\n\nSimilarly, wealth gained from adventure and victory allows the pirate to upgrade to larger ships with more deadly weaponry. A dozen unique fighting vessels will become available to skilled captains, along with special accoutrements that afford the ships extra powers. Sea battles involve a realistic combination of positioning and timing, as tall ships align themselves to fire on enemy vessels from port- and starboard-mounted weapons and time must be spent reloading the powerful cannons and guns after each shot. The ability to repair damage on the fly is also an important strategic consideration in ship-to-ship fights.\n\nThough the gameplay of this 3D adventure is oriented towards fast action, several elements of role-playing are also incorporated, to move the story along and involve the player more deeply. The lead character Katarina de Leon plots a thoughtful course for her career on the open seas. The \"Black Kat\" sets sail to uncover mysteries and position herself in circumstances that will increase her overall status among other pirates, securing a position of power. In addition to Katarina's well-developed storyline, the game's \"Captain vs. Captain\" battle mode allows a more combat-intensive, freeform style of play.\n\nPirates ? The Legend of Black Kat, formerly known as Pirates of Skull Cove, is Westwood's next-generation pirate game with epic ship battles and thrilling swordplay, starring Black Kat. Take to take to the high seas as Black Kat and master a dozen pirate ships from the simple gunboat to the massive power of a man o' war.

Players had to skim surfaces of the planets and destroy all the bunkers therein, as well as beam up fuel cells to maintain their fuel level(s) and avoiding or destroying saucers that would also appear. The game did not do very well commercially and would only be ported to the Atari 2600 a few years later (although it has reappeared on some modern day compilations since). \n \nGravitrex is a clone of Gravitar, although with many differences, such as the addition of humans dotting the planetary landscapes that have to be rescued, and the Gravitrex Plus cart also includes two bonus games and other features as well. All games are for one player only. \n \nGameplay: \n \nThe player controls a fighter ship that begins each game in a solar system. There is a sun in the middle and several planets to choose from to enter so the player can start their mission. If the player takes too long with choosing a planet, a pair of space saucers will emerge from the reactor planet and will engage the player in a dogfight if they get close enough (although the player can just elude them by entering a planet). If the player’s ship gets destroyed or the player shoots both saucers then the player will return to the main solar system screen. \nOnce the player enters a planet by thrusting into it, they must destroy every enemy bunker on the surface and dispose of every fuel tank and human. Humans and fuel tanks can be shot (although the player will not receive any points for doing so), but a bonus is given if all humans are rescued on a level (see Scoring and Extras sections), plus fuel tanks are needed to keep up the player’s fuel level (which is indicated by a line right next to the score at the top left of the screen). Humans and fuel tanks can be teleported into the player’s ship by maneuvering their ship close and activating the teleporter/shields function. Once all bunkers have been destroyed and all humans and fuel tanks have been disposed of, a sound effect will signal that the mission is complete, and upon leaving the planet, it will self-destruct and the player will be given a bonus for that planet. \n \nThe exception to this rule is the lone reactor planet on each level, which has only one target – a reactor – deep inside it. This planet is different than all the others, as the player is given 99 time units to make their way through a brief maze, shoot the reactor, and get out before time runs out or else the player’s ship will be destroyed and the reactor will remain intact. If the player does not destroy this planet last in a level then it clears out the space saucers for the remainder of the level, since this is the planet that they emerge from. \n \nDangers include the player’s ship crashing if it runs out of fuel, plus the ship will be destroyed if shot by a bunker, space saucer or alien air interceptor (which are similar to space saucers but they appear inside a planet), if they crash into a wall, the sun, space saucer or alien air interceptor, or do not leave the reactor planet before their time runs out. If the player runs out of reserve ships then the game will end. The player’s fuel, however, is replenished mostly from a fuel tank and is fully replaced upon destroying a planet, finishing a level, or with each new ship. The player’s teleporter function also doubles as a shield to protect them from enemy fire. Also, if the player defeats all planets in a level, then that level’s sun will go nova, various bonuses are then awarded (see Extras section), and if the player defeats the third level the game will end, giving a congratulations message as well as sharing some trivia about Gravitrex from the game’s programmer John Dondzila on the screen.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":45923,"name":"Jack Sprite vs. The Crimson Ghost","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Philips CD-i"}]},{"id":45907,"name":"Space Ranger: Return to Earth","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Philips CD-i"}]},{"id":22058,"name":"UEFA Champions League Season 2001/2002","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Installment in the UEFA soccer simulation series, featuring rosters and up-to-date data from the 2001/2002 season.

Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version.\n\nTomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point. While attacks can land without reaching the optimal point, their effectiveness tends to be severed in the process. Additionally, each attack has a separate amount of usage points which dictate how many times the player can use that specific attack before needing to revitalize themselves.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4k02.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"AlphaDream","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"iQue","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Graphic Research","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":8324,"name":"Dynomite!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It's prehistoric egg-blasting fun!
