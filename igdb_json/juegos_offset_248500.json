The unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization filled the air with smog, robbing humanity of the blue skies they'd once known. There is one place in particular where the sky is darker than anywhere else: the ruins of the Engine city New York, perpetually shrouded in grey clouds and polluted rain. Five years ago, a mysterious disaster known as the \"Great Disappearance\" reduced this entire metropolis to a deserted, crumbling wasteland. Sealed off from the world by the United States government, it stands in utter silence. Not a single soul now walks its streets. But today, a woman named Elysia quietly sets foot inside it - guided by a singular purpose. Her destination: old Manhattan, said to be the epicenter of the catastrophe. Unbeknownst to her... There is a place said to be the city's \"Underground.\" This is an enormous subterranean realm, permeated with a dim purple light. No one on the surface world knows of its existence. In this place, the Skyscrapers that crumbled five years ago still stand tall; but their forms are warped and twisted. \"Underground New York\" is a place of black and violet shadows. A prison with no exit. And beneath its unnatural \"sky,\" the men and women who vanished five years ago still exist... Cowering in fear of the seven monsters known as the \"Messengers.\" Suffering terror, agony, and death at the hands of the \"Messengers.\" They linger on in this twisted underground city, as if waiting for something. A girl named Lily sets foot in this place, her mind devoid of memories. There is only one thing she's certain of. She doesn't have a reason. She doesn't know who or what awaits her. She doesn't even know why she feels this way. But even so, she's absolutely certain. \"Manhattan. The ends of the violet sky.\" \"I have to go there. I'm the only one who can.\" ─The girl sets off for the tower of violet shadow looming far in the distance. ─With every step, she finds the shades of those yet to fade away. ─She isn't aware of the tears she sheds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ytt.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Liar-soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":268862,"name":"WWE 2K15: Showcase Season Pass","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The 2K Showcase Season Pass brings you more action and excitement from WWE 2K15's all-new 2K Showcase Mode.

Using Retreat pulls up the map and you can select any town that you’ve previously visited to instantly return there. The linearity of Golden Sun doesn’t make this as needed as other RPGs, but it does open up some options that would be unreasonable in the original game, such as Retreating back to Imil to restock on Hermes Water.\n\nAvoid now behaves as a random encounter toggle rather than a wear off effect. Using it once turns off 100% of random encounters, using it again turns them back on.\n\nDefault Psynergy:\n\nBuilding off the built in Psynergy the Randomizer provided, many utility Psynergy like Growth, Whirlwind, and even Avoid are built right into party members so they have them, regardless of your class. In addition, Psynergy not tied to battle no longer cost Psynergy to use. Though they have different names to distinguish from their battle equivalents. For example in battle Growth still cost Psynergy to use, but outside of battle it is refer to as “Sprout” but otherwise functions the same.\n\nPsynergy Items:\n\nPsynergy items also behave differently as well. Often when you first encounter them they won’t be items, but rather weapons and armor you can equip to party members to get the effect without wasting an extra item slot. When the equipment becomes out-classed, you can sell it at a shop and a more traditional Psynergy item will appear in any item shop’s Artifact section.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co75gh.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"JackitK","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":269064,"name":"Sonic Rivals Dash","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sonic Rivals Dash is a browser game published in 2006 to promote Sonic Rivals.
