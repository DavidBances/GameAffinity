The Khondo, a vicious band of looting militia have taken control of the country. You lead a small squad of mercenaries, who have vowed to restore order and rid the country of the Khondo.\n\nYou need to carefully plot your way through the region, recruiting mercenaries, upgrading your skills procuring armour and weapons and forming alliances with friendly militia. Each location in the campaign map hosts hostile militia, which you must fight in turn-based squad combat.\n\nWhen your squad is strong enough you can confront the ringleader militia, but it will not be easy.\n\nNearly everything in the game is randomly generated, including the campaign map, enemy and resource locations. Scene layout and buildings are procedurally generated, leading to a huge variety of different scenes which your squad has to fight through.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co94r1.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":183974,"name":"Miao and the Friendmily Journal: Miao","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Miao journal about the main character","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183975,"name":"Tonight We Hunt","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A hunter seeks revenge against the demons he faced in his past.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183976,"name":"Charge Cycles","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Everyone needs a good recharge once in a while","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183977,"name":"Dis Assemble","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Puzzle game where a robot can snap into two parts, however, each part can only execute some of the robot's actions","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183978,"name":"Jice","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"3D platformer with FPS elements","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183979,"name":"Bots n' Bugs","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A short and fun platformer about a little robot","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183980,"name":"Fanbots","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Help a bunch of robots resurrect their favorite TV show","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183981,"name":"Whale Eater","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Puzzle game about exploring a living, breathing whale","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"moraguma","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183982,"name":"Crackshot","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A shooter platformer - Octobear Jam","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183983,"name":"Mined","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Off World Mining Simulator","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183984,"name":"Mechanism","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"adventure/horror/depressive","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183985,"name":"Iron & Rust: Complete Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A thriller & Hard SF Visual Novel !","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":183986,"name":"Trust the blackbird","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Trust the blackbird is a hand-drawn 2d game made in a form of comics with lovely watercolour illustrations.
