Border. is an optimistic strategy game about travelling, freedom and changing the world!\n\nYou are a freelance adventurer who wants to experience everything planet Heart has to offer, regardless of the inherited privileges determined by the country of your birth.\n\nCONCEPT\nYou travel to learn, and as you pay a closer attention to what each country has to offer, you gather wisdom that you channel in a blog that grows in popularity. Eventually you come to grasp the power of your influence: where you pass, things change faster to the better, and locals that you have met increasingly demand openness from their governments. You have always been an optimist and dreamed of a completely border free world, but as you travel, you realise you might actually actually live to see your dream come true - that of living in a world without borders!\n\nVISUALS\nHeart. Papers. Border. is inspired by NASA's Visions of the Future posters, The Jetsons' cartoon series and current real life events. We chose vibrant colours and a retro futuristic style to gently remind you that Heart, just like Earth, is moving towards openness, kindness and love, even though the movement might sometimes seem too slow to notice. But you can always make a difference!\n\nGAMEPLAY\nHeart. Papers. Border. is as easy or as challenging as you want it to be. Through very simple control mechanics and up front information, you can strategize an optimal life that allows you to see the last border disappear in the course of your long and safe life. With multiple win conditions, challenging puzzles and morally difficult quests, Heart. Papers. Border. simply asks you how do you choose to live this virtual life\n\nSo how will you play?\n- Create your Multipass and choose your Citizenship (Easy, Med, High, Random); this determines your starting conditions\n- Take a look at your native country, look at the Top Bar to see your situation and starting conditions\n- Click on touristic objectives to visit them, click on countries to apply for Visas and then visit them\n- Gather hashtags from visiting objectives and write blog posts in your SpacePad\n- Gain followers, become influential, and notice how planet Heart responds to your actions\n\nA few Development Details\nThis is a Pre Alpha game, and we have many features in the pipeline which are Work in Progress now. If you wish to keep track of our progress, we shared our live game design wiki so check our presence on the web. Please keep in mind:\n- We aim to launch the first version of Heart. Papers.

Everyone expected the league leaders to roll into town and easily defeat the home team. But the scrappy upstarts have played the game of their lives and managed to keep the score tied right until the end. Their fatigue is showing and now it's their last chance. If the home team batters don’t score a run now, the visitors will be sure to win the game in extra innings. It all comes down to the Bottom of the 9th!\n\nWill you lead the underdogs to victory? Or will you defend the league leaders’ unbroken winning streak?\n\nBottom of the 9th is a strategic 2-player baseball game played with cards and dice. This faithful adaptation brings the fast-paced fun of the tabletop game to your phone and tablet! Choose your lineup from a pool of players with different strengths and abilities, outsmart your opponent in the stare-down, then roll the dice to trigger the action.\n\nBottom of the 9th offers many ways to play:\n• Compete in single player against a computer opponent (3 levels of difficulty)\n• Take on the Manager's Challenge 6-game solo campaign mode\n• Pass and play on your device with a friend\n• Challenge a friend to play online\n• Find a worthy opponent in a ranked online match\n• Organize a casual online exhibition game\n\nThe powerhouse visitors have 6 dynamite pitchers to choose from, including:\n• Wake Louder throws a nasty knuckleball that can get a lost ball just into the edge of the strike zone.\n• Southpaw Straw is a talented lefty pitcher with one dangerously effective (and illegal) spitball.\n• Hurricane Patriss is a top notch reliever, and the only thing more hypnotic than his curveball is his voice.\n\nDon't count out the home team! They have a dozen batters, each with their own special powers, including:\n• Mully Nomah can be devastating against the pitching team when runners are in scoring position. He can clobber a pitch and get those base runners home!\n• Kerry Rumble has power behind her swing. She has the ability to crush the ball hard, at the cost of hitting lots of fouls. She just can’t resist taking a swing!\n• K.C. Petty is truly a powerhouse when the chips are down. The more strikes he gets, the bigger he swings.\n• Hannah Cait may look innocent, but when she's in the zone she calls all the shots! This rookie's level of control over her swing is the envy of many a veteran.\n\nBoth teams have access to 2 support characters who provide special abilities to one or both teams:\n• Dice Dixon has no problem taking chances coming out from the dugout, benching batters and challenging umps!\n• Doc Mullins is always looking after the health of the team, whether that means a more rested pitcher or more energized batters!\n\nThe Manager's Challenge solo campaign mode puts you right in the dugout as a team manager. Can you lead your team to the playoffs in a 6-game homestand?\n• Play 6 game solo campaigns as the home team against a revolving cast of pitchers.\n• Compete in 9 different game situations, including multiple inning games.\n• Each campaign game is played using one of 6 effect cards that change the feel of the game.\n\n~~~ There’s nothing that’s quite like the thrill you feel in the Bottom of the 9th! ~~~\n\nCompatible with Android devices with NEON CPU support. Older devices with Tegra 2 CPUs are not compatible. The recommended minimum amount of device RAM is 1 GB.\n\nBottom of the 9th is an officially licensed product of “Bottom of the 9th” from Greater Than Games and Dice Hate Me Games.\n\nFor more information, visit Bot9Digital.com","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3mif.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Handelabra Games Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":87513,"name":"Snipers vs Thieves: FPS Clash","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Snipers vs Thieves is a REAL-TIME multiplayer FPS heist game!

At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn.\n\nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.\n\nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co252a.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Daedalic Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":14364,"name":"Matterfall","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Overcome an ever-expanding threat that might have already seeped too far into the core of humanity itself.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y58.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Xdev","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Housemarque","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":311482,"name":"Midnight Spooks: The Thing in the Basement","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8luq.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"carmel games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":174630,"name":"Cytoid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cytoid is an open-source rhythm game where you can create, share and play your own levels!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4xtd.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tiger Tang","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":135326,"name":"Tap Strike Boom!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Give your brain the next big challenge with \"Tap Strike Boom!\"\n\nYour goal is to go through the \"Mystical Gate of the Heavens\", but it won't just let anyone in!\n\nHeavily influenced by the 'Voltorb Flip', a minigame in the Pokemon series, Tap Strike BOOM! challenges yo to solve the puzzles that the gate will throw at you.

Our spellcasting and shaping system grants the player an unrivaled level of customization and reconfiguration. Up to three runes can be applied to a spell, each affecting a different spell characteristic, and can be changed to suit the player’s current need, interest, or whim. You might amplify ice blasts to freeze enemies in place, expand the radius of a fireball explosion to crumble a bridge and hinder pursuers, or chain a lightning attack together to strike several clustered targets. Shaping makes spellcasting tactical and satisfying; an experience more about tailoring your magical arsenal to effectively, efficiently, and enthusiastically destroy every obstacle. \n \nYet, challenge is abundant—the wizard must bring down a sprawling empire by himself. Your journey across the randomly-generated world map features locations chock full of enemies and structures to destroy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co215i.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Scraping Bottom Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":313842,"name":"Witness Of Time","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"9 map episode similar to favillesco alpha and mano laikas.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8osy.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":277495,"name":"Day of Night","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Map takes place in nighttime.

Well, this is Fat Rat Pinball, a nice casual game free to play! The challenges of a classic pinball are mixed up with the rat body physics creating a unique, unexpected and fun pinball arcade game.\n\nWith this new game you'll see animals flying over the pinball machine, being hit by the flippers, bouncing as a ball in the bumpers and increasing your score on each collision. But don't panic - no animals are hurt in this game. Everything happens in a nice way.\n\nAs a casual game, you can try to beat up one of the pinball tables in about ten minutes. Some pinball machines have stages, as a kind of runner, and you go up until the end point. So, it's part of the game challenge to win the tables, but you'll need to be skilled to do it.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: one touch in the right or left screen side and you'll activate the respective flipper. For launching the ball, you should touch the screen and slide down to choose the spring force. It's possible to play with one finger - one hand game - but we recommend using both hands for more speed on activating the paddles.\n\nFat Rat Pinball uses a reward system, and you can earn rubies while playing. Completing a pinball table a couple of times will make you earn rubies enough to release new content inside the game. There are rewarded Ads after the matches and you can choose if you want to watch them or not - you are not forced to see any Ad while playing.\n\nUsing your rubies can release new characters and tables for playing. The actual version comes with 3 pinball machines and 4 bodies-balls.\n\nThe score records and achievements are incorporated with Game Center services, where you can see the game rankings.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2y81.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Invent4 Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":136152,"name":"Ark: Survival Evolved - Limited Collector's Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This package includes:\n\n- Ark: Survival Evolved Game\n- Season Pass with all 3 Expansion Packs\n- Handcrafted leather-bound Explorer's Notebook, featuring the Dossiers of every creature you’ll find in “ARK: Survival Evolved”\n- Official ARK necklace\n- Cloth map of the ARK island\n- Development team poster\n- Collectible faux-wooden chest packaging","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8i7d.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Studio Wildcard","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":129496,"name":"Minecraft: China Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Minecraft: China Edition is a localized edition of Java and Bedrock editions for mainland China, developed by Mojang Studios and NetEase.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27sn.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NetEase Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mojang Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":91033,"name":"Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode 1: The Enigma","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this latest chapter from the award-winning studio behind Batman - The Telltale Series, both Bruce Wayne and Batman will be forced into precarious new roles.
