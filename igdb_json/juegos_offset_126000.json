The management mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own model kit based on their real-life counterparts.\n\nThere are over 100 Gunpla kits to choose from, which gives you endless building opportunities! You can colorize parts, define material types such as plastic or chrome, add decals, scale optional loadouts, and save your kits into a list to restore whenever you want to fight with that model.\n\nAside from customizing the entire body, you get a shield, melee weapon, and ranged weapon slot for your primary arsenal, 4 Ex-Actions for explosive attacks, and 8 slots for your optional loadouts which can include missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, beam sabers, axes, and all sorts of other offensive and defensive mechanisms. This is one of the most freeform combat experiences ever made in 3rd person arena combat.\n\nTwo escorts join you in most of the battles, performing healing and attack actions while also rescuing you from being knocked out. You can also instruct them to do certain actions.\n\nA new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode, players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency and all parts that have been broken off of enemy kits.\n\nThe Break Edition includes all the DLC of the normal edition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kys.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":136194,"name":"Heroland: Knowble Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Heroland theme park offers guests an authentic RPG-style adventure for a price, but when a scruffy young park guide and his guests uncover ulterior motives by the organizers, legends become reality, and guests must take the fate of the park (and the world!) into their own hands.

Each chapter takes you through all the standard maps with a predefined bot set up and boss battles. Between chapters you return to Dr. Light’s lab, where you can practice with weapons etc.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2j45.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":136286,"name":"My Hero One's Justice 2: Deluxe Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Deluxe Edition includes:\n- Full game\n- Season Pass\n- In-game item: Ribbit Ribbit Set","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3k3v.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":136287,"name":"The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki FC Evolution","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki FC Evolution is a remake of The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki.

By planting seeds in the right places, they’re able to create small overgrown dioramas of brutalism and beauty, salvaging and repurposing hundreds of discarded objects to create unique structures for nature to reclaim.\n\nPlayers can dive into a relaxing sandbox mode with no goals, where they are simply left to delight in their own creativity and create beautiful scenes, or take on a “campaign” of six chapters, where the task is to strike a balance between nature and the manufactured by covering each scene with salvaged objects and lush vegetation.\n\nThis is a chill game where the player is allowed to delight in their own creativity. The player's task is to completely cover the scene in plants. As you overgrow the objects, a meter fills to show your progress. You are given objects to expand the scene. These objects contribute energy to the growing of plants, but you will also have to cover them in foliage to complete the stage, striking a balance between nature and the manufactured.\n\nWith generative soundscapes by Amos Roddy, composer of the Kingdom Series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2swb.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Noio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":136408,"name":"EvoTown","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"On a journey to the Evolution of the Red Town, \na game with a unique story, \na game with adventure and a tactical game at the same time. \nEvoTown is a game of skill in which two groups compete against each other, the so-called Vulgarian House and the Vuled House.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2edb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"YouLex","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"TwoLines","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":136409,"name":"Embracelet","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Embracelet is an adventure game set in Northern Norway - a unique coming of age story about love, loss, friendship and family - and a magical bracelet with mysterious powers!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2h7o.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Machineboy","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":136410,"name":"OverTime","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"OverTime is a game about...time.
