Every round has 5 difficulties; starting with “baby” difficulty all the way to “nightmare”. The amount of points earned for each successful guess depends on the selected activity – describing, drawing, or pantomime.\n\nFor example, describing is the easiest one, so for each successful guess you will get only one point. However, in the case of pantomime you get three points per word. Each round, you can pick which activity to do. You can decide to play it safe and choose to describe all the time, though if your opponents ace the harder activities, they will most likely beat you.\n\nYou can keep up with your current standing by checking team scores depicted as cute progress bars with each team’s color at the bottom of the screen. They show which team is closer to earning fifty points and winning the game. To see who is the reigning Partivity champion among your friends, you can check out the previous games section for the history of all played games along with each game’s winner. If you are up to the task of snatching their champion title, just tap the rematch button and the game is on.\n\nFeatures\nPlay in two to six teams with as many people as you like.\nPause the game just by closing the app and continue whenever you feel like it.\nRecreate teams from previous games to beat the last winner. Increasing difficulty with each successful guess.\nTeam scores visible at a glance with cute progress bars.\n6 supported languages: English, Spanish, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, Czech and Slovak.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1jhs.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Brightify","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":115318,"name":"Sacrifice of the Beloved","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"ABOUT THE GAME:\nSacrifice Of The Beloved (SOB) is a game horro/puzzle developed by one person(16Y) in the course of 3 months.\n\nABOUT PUZZLES IN THE GAME:\nSome of the puzzles are story based so one has to pay attention to the story to solve them easily.\n\nPLAYTIME: 30-40 MINS\nNOTE: IT'S A WEIRD GAME BY A WEIRD PERSON :|","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1jcs.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Vishcorp Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":114962,"name":"Column Taker","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Column Taker a cooperative game where you try to see if your friend and you can take pieces out of a building without knocking it down","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":114930,"name":"Hockey Camp - Goaltender","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hockey Camp - Goaltender presents the opportunity to compete through a competitive goalie hockey camp.
