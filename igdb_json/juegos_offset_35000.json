For players who wish to experience the original world of Golden Sun with those features.\n\nAdjustments to Overworld Abilities/Quality of Life Updates:\n\nRetreat not only warps you to the start of a dungeon or town but now functions similarly to teleport when used on the world map. Using Retreat pulls up the map and you can select any town that you’ve previously visited to instantly return there. The linearity of Golden Sun doesn’t make this as needed as other RPGs, but it does open up some options that would be unreasonable in the original game, such as Retreating back to Imil to restock on Hermes Water.\n\nAvoid now behaves as a random encounter toggle rather than a wear off effect. Using it once turns off 100% of random encounters, using it again turns them back on.\n\nDefault Psynergy:\n\nBuilding off the built in Psynergy the Randomizer provided, many utility Psynergy like Growth, Whirlwind, and even Avoid are built right into party members so they have them, regardless of your class. In addition, Psynergy not tied to battle no longer cost Psynergy to use. Though they have different names to distinguish from their battle equivalents. For example in battle Growth still cost Psynergy to use, but outside of battle it is refer to as “Sprout” but otherwise functions the same.\n\nPsynergy Items:\n\nPsynergy items also behave differently as well. Often when you first encounter them they won’t be items, but rather weapons and armor you can equip to party members to get the effect without wasting an extra item slot.
