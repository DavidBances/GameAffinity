(English and German translations available for this deck at this time)\n\nWinner of the 2013 Board Game of the Year from Pocket Tactics!\n\nEurope is recovering from some hard times. You and a spouse must grow your 2-room hut and empty farmyard into a productive farm. You must sow and reap, raise animals and expand your family in order to thrive. Europe in the 17th century: a tough time to be a farmer!\n\nAgricola is a family-friendly strategy game. Simple to understand and great fun, Agricola lets everyone play to the end in a race to see who can build the most productive farm.\n\nEasy To Play\nAgricola is a turn-based game, played in six Stages and 14 Rounds. On a turn, players place a family member token on a location in town in order to collect resources or to take actions to improve their farm. They can get building materials such as Wood and Clay, plow fields and sow crops, or build fences to keep animals. New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.\n\nAt harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!\n\nThe player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family’s home, for the number of family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards. Players lose one point for each unused farmyard space.\n\nAn award-winning board game and player favorite since 2007, Agricola is now available as a universal game application.\n\nBrought to you by Playdek, Agricola establishes a new benchmark for iPad board gaming.\n\nFeatures:\n•4 Game play modes: Family Game; Basic Game; Solo Play; Solo Series\n•1-5 players\n•Included AI opponents\n•Pass-and-play multiplayer (2-5 players)\n•Asynchronous or real-time online play (2-5 players)\n•Universal game application – buy once and play on all your devices\n•Game Center Achievements\n•Selectable Online game clocks\n•Rematch button for online and offline matches\n•“Next Game” button takes you to your next asynchronous online game\n•Matchmaking\n•Player Rankings\n•Multiple Player Profiles (for households)\n•Select your Family Token art for your profile\n•Game tutorials for interface, game play and strategy\n•Rule Book and Card Gallery to review game text and effects\n•Options for Music and SFX, game speed and animation speed, and confirmation pop-ups\n•Game overview, turn log and game event calendar to support asynchronous play\n•Retina support\n•iPhone / iPod 5 screen support\n•Localizations: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese\n\nFrom Playdek, the award-winning publisher and developer:\n•D&D Lords of Waterdeep - 5 stars on PocketTactics & AppAddicts!!\n•Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer (Golden Geek, 2011 – Boardgamegeek.com)\n•Summoner Wars (Golden Geek, 2012 – Boardgamegeek.com; Game of the Year 2012, Pockettactics.com; Game of the Year, Board/Card, 2012 - Gamezebo)\n•Tanto Cuore\n•Nightfall\n•Fluxx\n•Penny Arcade the Game: Gamers vs Evil\n•Can’t Stop\n•Food Fight iOS","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/finsnbrk56hhai4avkse.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":88317,"name":"Easy-Peasy Tic Tac Toe","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":88318,"name":"Hotel Island: Paradise Story!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":88319,"name":"Bomb Craft Tnt","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":88320,"name":"Kingdom Rush HD","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Get ready for an epic journey to defend your kingdom against hordes of orcs, trolls, evil wizards and other nasty fiends using a vast arsenal of towers and spells at your command! \n \nFight on forests, mountains and wastelands, customizing your defensive strategy with different tower upgrades and specializations!

Well played, people!*\n*Whoa! You made us #1 in Simulation! Thanks, we love you people!*\n\nA note from the developer:\n\nHi, and thanks for taking a look at Virtual Families 2! We have been working on it for quite a while, and we’re very happy to be able to finally share this new chapter with everyone.\n\nBefore you skip down to the bullet points and screenshots, let me say a few quick words about this game, and life simulations in general: I love life simulation games. I have always been passionate about designing them, and almost everything that comes out of Last Day of Work is a life sim of some kind. This one, in particular, thrills me so much because it is designed to have a life of its own: unpredictable and so different each time I play it, and each time another player plays it. I love that the story unfolds differently for everyone who plays it, and your experience with the game might be wildly different from your friends’ experience.\n\nDesigning this type of game, however, has its own special challenges. The main challenge is that EVERYTHING in life is a great idea to add to a game like this. There are SO many great ideas, and we simply cannot put them all in at launch. So, while I hope the game captivates you as much as it does us, there will inevitably be things that you feel are missing and you would love to see added (tell us!).\n\nWe plan to update the content in this game. We want to add pets, hidden puzzles, more storyline, more events, tons of new things to buy, and the list goes on and on. We will also continue to tune and deepen all the game's inner workings that control happiness, health, and everything else. While the game has been balanced to be playable for free and without purchasing anything, we hope that you will find something compelling enough in the game to give us support so that we can continue to create fun new updates.\n\nEnjoy Virtual Families 2! Please visit our Facebook page and our forums to give your own amazing ideas and suggestions, and don’t forget to check in on your little family or they will get very sad. :)\n\nWith sincere gratitude, \nArthur Humphrey\nLead Designer, Last Day of Work\n\n\nVirtual Families 2 has all this and more:\n\n* Adopt a little person and start a family. Make babies and pass the house on to the kids!\n\n* Train your little people to behave as you wish by praising and scolding them.\n\n* Your little people will send you messages, thanking, pleading, and praising you for caring for them.\n\n* Runs in True Real Time. Your little people continue to live, eat, grow, and work when the app is switched off.\n\n* Your little family is in your time zone! Is it getting dark where you live? Your little family is probably getting ready for bed then...\n\n* Highly varied, unpredictable game play. No two games run the same. \n\n* Make babies. Cure illnesses. Help nurture and guide generations of your family.\n\n* Restore the house. Finish and fix rooms.
