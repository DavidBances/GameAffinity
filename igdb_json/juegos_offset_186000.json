A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.\n\nSpring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.\n\nLineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.\n\nFinty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.\n\nColor Collision. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time. The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.\n\nRat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.\n.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3gal.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":71066,"name":"Hot Wheels Stunt Track Driver 2: Get 'N Dirty","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6iry.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50023,"name":"Rip-Tide Racer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rip-Tide Racer is a Racing game, developed and published by Cryo Interactive, which was released in Europe in 2000.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7m9n.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":46507,"name":"Vectrace","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Weave your way through the other race cars and toward the checkered flag!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co79gz.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":37537,"name":"Vaboom!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Catch the falling bombs!

Innerhalb eines Jahres verkaufte es sich mehr als 200.000 Mal. Von den Spielemagazinen wurde es mit guten Wertungen bedacht (z. B. PC Player 87 %, Gamestar 88 %, PC Games 86 %).\nJedoch war es zu Beginn geradezu gefüllt mit Bugs, was von der Spielergemeinde kritisiert wurde. Dennoch wurde es von den Anstoss-Fans mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, da es die wichtigsten Elemente von Anstoss 2 Gold enthielt und diese noch weiter vertiefen konnte.\nAls besonders gelungen gilt die 3D-Spieldarstellung. Der Spieler konnte sich ein komplettes Spiel seines Teams reduziert auf neun Minuten ansehen. Auch der Szenenmodus galt als revolutionär, da die Szenen nicht, wie in den Vorgängerteilen, vorberechnet wurden. Kommentiert wurden die Spielszenen durch den bekannten Fußballkommentator Günther Koch.\nAuch neu war die Umsetzung des Vereinsgeländes. Von Apfelbäumen über Konditionsparcours und Doping-Labor bis hin zu Wolkenkratzern konnte der Spieler sein Vereinsgelände mit Gebäuden, Gegenständen und Lebewesen mit und ohne Nutzen erweitern.\nMit der Veröffentlichung des finalen Patches auf Version 1.40 wurde es nahezu bugfrei und konnte die Anstoss-Spieler überzeugen. Insgesamt wurden bis heute über eine Million Exemplare von Anstoss 3 verkauft und machen es damit zu einem der erfolgreichsten PC-Spiele Deutschlands. Trotz seines Alters wird Anstoss 3 durch die große Spieltiefe zusammen mit einem gelungenen Text- und 3D-Modus als bester Teil der Anstoss-Reihe angesehen. Dass Anstoss 3 auch heute noch sehr beliebt ist, hängt auch mit dem Multiplayermodus zusammen. So wird es bis zu 4 Spielern ermöglicht, im Netzwerk gegeneinander anzutreten.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ky3.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":10911,"name":"Evolva","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A game in which mankind sends its bio-engineered troops to stop a parasite race from destroying the universe. \n \nEvolva combines the excitement of a fast paced shoot-em-up with the tactical challenge of commanding a squad.
