Vol. 3: Redemption is the third entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2vtd.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco Bandai Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CyberConnect2","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":12028,"name":"D/Generation","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Alone with your jetpack, you have flown from Finland across the Urals and the entire length of Asia to deliver a package to Genoq Biolabs in Singapore.

The player is a government agent, sent secretly to the moon's surface with the mission of deactivating the weapon before it becomes fully charged. This is accomplished by destroying a power network in the form of ECD (Energy Collection Device) columns, dotted around the moon and connected with power lines all the way to the beam weapon. \nAn ECD (Energy Collection Device) column. To destroy the ECD, the player needs to shoot the top part of the column. \n \nTo complete the mission, the player has at his disposal an arsenal of beam weapons mounted on a jetpack equipped pressure suit. The aim is to destroy all ECDs in a specific order and avoid capture and death by the traps left by the terrorists. ECDs are connected to power lines and can only be destroyed when all preceding ECDs have been deactivated, otherwise they will instantly regenerate. The player has limited amount of time available to complete the game, based on the energy accumulated in Zephyr One. When the weapon is fully charged, the beam is fired destroying Evath and the game ends.

Flyff is a fairly typical party-oriented grinding game where no character can do everything; efficient play requires working in groups to level up by killing monsters, or Masquerpets. Its main distinctiveness lies in its flying system: flying is the normal method of transportation for characters above level 20.\n\nFlyff is hosted in 13 countries and 10 languages and is played by over 30 million people.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nPlayers control an avatar that spends most of its active time fighting and most of its inactive time running a shop. Character classes are chosen at level 15 and sub-classes at levels 60 and 130, referred to as the first, second, and third job changes. The job changes are obligatory—when a character reaches the requisite level, experience gain stops until the completion of one of the job quests. At level 120, the character can become a Master, returning to level 60 with enhanced powers and able to work its way back up to level 121 and become a Hero. As of version 17, Heroes may select a third job class at level 130 and level up to the current cap of 150.\n\nLevels are gained based on experience, which can be acquired by killing Masquerpets and by performing quests. Quests generally involve killing specific Masquerpets and collecting the different quest objects they drop; a typical early quest is that of \"Party of Is,\" with the requirement of collecting 7 Chupims through killing Pukepukes.\n\nAt each level, the character receives skill points that can be invested in skills available to its job(s). There are two types of skills: those used for attacking and those used for protection and/or enhancement. Skills may have cool-down times and may cause status effects, with confusion, stun, and bleed among the most common effect. It is not possible to acquire maximum levels in all available skills until becoming a level 60 Master.\n\nCharacters can be improved by acquiring objects such as improved equipment. Masquerpets drop equipment, the in-game currency penya, consumable items such as food and potions, and quest objects, or players can purchase equipment from other players note this is usually extremely expensive because of the high quality gear that can be acquired this way. These can all be traded between players; Flyff gameplay involves large amounts of buying and selling in order to collect desired equipment. Most equipment items have minimum levels at which they can be used.\n\nCombat\nFlyff features melee, ranged and magic combat, with different skills available to different classes. Health points, fight points, and magic power bars are able to be replenished through food, vital drinks and mana refreshers; some classes depend on assists to heal them with magic.\n\nPvP\nPlayer versus player (PvP) combat is allowed on all servers without penalty in the form of dueling. Both players must be over level 15, and within 30 levels of each other, then they must confirm the duel first unless they are within the PvP Arena, a free-for-all environment found on all servers. Player killing is allowed only on the Yetti server and carries a high penalty.\n\nSOCIAL SYSTEMS:\nLord System\nIntroduced in version 12, the Lord system allows eligible players to be voted as the Lord of their server for 2 weeks. Players must have obtained Hero or Master status to qualify as a Lord candidate. While a Lord, a player may introduce a number of events on the server. Lords are taxed between 0 to 20% on all NPC purchases and returns and are given a portion of all player taxes. 10% of eligible voters must participate in the Lord vote for a Lord to be chosen. To vote for a candidate, a player must be at least level 60 and must have logged in to the game within the last 30 days. Each player may only vote for one candidate per election.\n\nParty System\nPlayers who join a party gain increased experience and loot. A lone player does not benefit from or harm a party. A party starts as a Regular Party, in which experience is distributed evenly among party members in the same location. At level 10, the party becomes Advanced, at which point experience can be distributed to players based on their amount of damage done. An Advanced Party may have up to 8 players; having this many players in a party increases player experience with each monster killed during training.\n\nGuild System\nGuilds allow players to socialize; players within a guild can chat with each other and many in-game activities are guild-based. Guilds have a hierarchical chain of command, consisting of the Master/Leader, Kingpins, Captains, Supporters, and Rookies. The guild master may change the permissions for guild members, allowing members to withdraw items or money from the guild bank, rank-up or de-rank other members, and be paid daily. Guilds are able to choose an emblem and cloak to represent themselves and have the use of a warehouse. When a guild reaches the appropriate guild level, increased by supporting the guild through quest items and Penya, the guild master may create guild cloaks at a cost that sport the guild's symbol. A large amount of Flyff end-game content is guild-related.\n\nGuild Siege\nThis event, held on Saturday in channel 1 of each server, allows guilds to compete in a free-for-all environment. A total of 8 Guilds may enter, and each Guild may have 10 players. To compete, the Guild leader must place a bid; the 8 highest bidders compete.\n\nClockworks War\nThe Clockworks War is a guild dungeon that guilds of any level may enter a single time. If the guild fails against the dungeon boss, its players may reattempt to win as many times as necessary for a time period of one hour. Only one guild is permitted inside the Clockworks Arena at a time.\n\nCouple System\nThe couple system, implemented in Version 13, allows a marriage-style connection between two characters. Characters who become a couple are granted special buffs and skills and receive gifts with new couple level gained.\n\nMentor/Pupil System\nThe Mentor/Pupil system, implemented in Version 15, allows any player level 91 or above to take on any character who has not completed their second Job Change as a pupil after completing the mentor qualification quest. This Mentor/Pupil bond provides a special bonus to experience gained by both mentor and pupil while both characters are logged on to the same server. Additionally, upon the pupil reaching certain level marks, the mentor gains 'Mentor Points'; as the mentor gains more of these points, additional pupils may be taken on, to a maximum of 3 pupils when over 100 Mentor Points are gained. These additional pupils grant increases to the experience bonus of the mentor; the other pupils' experience bonus' remain unchanged.\n\nWhile no action apart from the initial bonding is necessary within the Mentor/Pupil relationship, mentors are encouraged to help their pupils with advice, quests, and/or occasional gifts. If at any time either pupil or mentor becomes dissatisfied, the player may cancel the bond. The Mentor Points of a mentor who loses all pupils returns to 0 and must be regained through new Mentor/Pupil bonds.\n\nOTHER GAME SYSTEMS:\nEvents\nEvents involving rare drops and extra experience are held almost every week by the gamemaster team. Maintenance is held every Tuesday evening (gPotato) and Thursday noon (FlyFF PH).\n\nCollector System\nRe-Introduced in version 11, the Collector System allows players to collect rare and unique game items through the use of a Collectors.\n\nPrivate Shops\nPlayers can open private shops, in which held items can be sold at any price. Other players can enter these shops and purchase the items within, with the purchase money transferred to the shop owner's inventory.\n\nRaising Pets\nPlayers may keep seven types of Raised Pets, which start out as eggs that may be dropped by any Masquerpet level 20 and above. An egg can be hatched by the Pet Tamer NPC after feeding the egg 50,000 pet feed. To evolve a pet, players must complete quests given by the Pet Tamer. Pets must also be fed to keep them alive. Each Raised Pet has five levels and three appearances. A player accompanied by a pet receives additional stat points based on the type of pet.\n\nElements\nMonsters are generally associated with a particular in-game elements, of which there are five. Each element is vulnerable to one element and resistant to another. Weapons and armor can be \"elemented\", conferring advantages against monsters of some types and disadvantages against others; many aggressive spells are also elemented.\n\nCash Shop\nFlyff uses a micropayment system through which users can obtain 'Game Cash'. Game Cash can be exchanged for premium items not otherwise available in the game, including clothing, potions, different kinds of scrolls and pick-up pets.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nIn December 2002, Aeonsoft developed the first provisional prototype of the game, called Clockworks Ltd. In September 2003, the company changed the game's name to Flyff, and began its first closed beta in Korea. In July 2004, it won the Game of the Month award from the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Over the next year, it was launched in three more countries: China, Taiwan, and Thailand. In October 2005, the US received the closed beta, which ran for a month before Flyff was commercially launched in December.\n\nTECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT:\nGame mechanics\nAeonsoft employs its own in-house core technology. The world object engine uses load balancing middle-ware, multi-thread and parallel game logic processing. The 3D flying engine uses faster process with vector and collide mesh and 3D space divided by Octree System. Its network sync engine utilities packet optimization by object move estimation, client-side sync calculation, and object move calibration processes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3xug.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gala Lab Corp.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Aeonsoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":12055,"name":"Dragon Spirit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dragon Spirit is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1987 and licensed to Atari Games for its American manufacture and distribution.\nIn the kingdom of Mitgult, a serpent demon named Zawell escapes imprisonment after a thousand years, and kidnaps Princess Alicia.

In a desperate search to find a new home, they found Evath, a life-sustaining planet with two moons, Mitral and Tricuspid. They sent a ship, named \"Exodus\" to colonize this new planet with explorers, embryos and supplies. Generations passed, and the colony on Evath was formed. Without the rule of law, the oldest members of the Exodus' crew, the Elders, were forced to take control, form an army and bring the rule of law to Evath.\n\nLesleigh Skerrit aspired to work for the Driller Federation. His grandfather had been a member of the Federation, but he was falsely accused of murder and banished as a Ketar. Only later did the evidence contesting his guilt surface, but it was too late - the law did not allow someone banished as a Ketar to return to Evath. Lesleigh was not bitter and did not seek retribution. He wanted to study law to prevent this kind of mistake happening again.\n\nCalled in by his superior, Montigue Yarbro, he is offered a lifetime opportunity - to complete his training and gain a promotion to Elite within the Driller Federation in one fell swoop. His experience on Mitral bore him well - he was to go to Mitral and attempt to avert the coming catastrophe. Mitral, having been abandoned in its unstable state by the Ketars, was going to explode within four hours, and the explosion would take Evath with it. Skerrit's mission was to use the excavation probe \"Last Hope\" to place eighteen drilling rigs around Mitral to allow the gas to dissipate harmlessly into space and prevent this disaster. Things are not so simple though, with the security systems activated prior to the Ketars' departure.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ygocp2x8jdxct5rekxfm.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Incentive Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Epyx","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Incentive Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":12060,"name":"Dynasty Wars","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story.

Tightwad, whom the circus owes $10,000, arrives on the scene with the intent of demolishing the circus unless it can pay up. He plans to build a set of luxury hotels on the terrain. In a fit of desperation, the ringmaster organises a display of six events to raise money for the doomed circus: diving, juggling, trapeze, knife throwing, tightrope and the human cannonball. The performance in each event is judged by five clown judges, who offer money depending on the quality of the show. The businessman has no intention of letting the circus raise the cash though, and he sends his lackey, the evil Fiendish Freddy, to sabotage the acts.\nEach player is represented by a circus animal (tiger, lion, bear, etc.)\n\nThe game was similar to many of the multi-event sports games of the time such as Epyx' California Games, Winter Games and Summer Games. However, Fiendish Freddy differed not only by its surroundings (circus events) offering a comedy element, it also offered a plot and a clear goal of winning $10,000. The six events were thus:\n\nThe player is challenged to jump off four diving boards of increasing height into containers of water of decreasing size, beginning with a huge wooden container, and ending in a glass of water. (The third target, however, is a cement block, a possible homage to the Looney Tunes cartoon Big Top Bunny, amongst other things.) Money is earned by completing all four levels, as well as performing a set series of stunts. Freddy attempts to hinder the player by blowing the diver off course with an enormous hair dryer; he appears if the diver fails to complete the stunt in time.\n\nThe player must make their way through four juggling sessions of increasing difficulty. Each level brings more balls to juggle, but not just balls - sometimes babies get lost in the mass and must be thrown back into their prams. Of course, Freddy throws a surprise or two into the mix, in the form of bombs, which can be thrown back at Freddy to consequently explode in his face, or missiles which must be juggled as per other objects. Dropping bombs or missiles will cause them to explode and kill the juggler.\nThe juggler is allowed five mistakes (marked by dots changing from green to red) before the game is over. Missing five times without dying from a bomb or missile leads an off-stage performer to use a cane to grab the juggler and yank him off screen.\n\nThe aim of this section is to proceed from right to left over three levels, jumping from rope to rope. Along the way there are rings of fire and moving targets which have to be mastered. Freddy, as usual, is omnipresent with a jet pack and large pair of scissors to cut your act short if you are too slow.\nSights on the ground, ranging from a marching band and organ to a trainer with his elephant, are also present as a possible distraction, although it can also be argued that the former are providing the music for the act.\n\nThe player must throw knives at balloons on a rotating wheel with a female assistant strapped to it. The assistant is not a target, and will scream if hit, as well as the screen getting covered in blood. There are a limited number of knives available. If the player does not manage to burst all of the balloons before the time or knives run out, it's over. Freddy contributes to the challenge once in a while by throwing smoke grenades in to hinder the player's vision.\n\nThe player must walk across three tightropes armed only with a pole to keep balance. Freddy intervenes occasionally with his jet pack, attempting to knock the player off the rope, or with razor blades to cut the player in half. The blades can be deflected with the pole.\n\nThe final event involves an attempt by the player to launch him or herself into a target from a cannon. The amount of gunpowder in the cannon is predetermined, and the player has to judge the angle necessary to launch the character into the target. Freddy plays a smaller role in this subgame - he only gets involved if the player takes too long to decide upon the angle, upon which he destroys the cannon.\n\nThere are two endings to the game.\nIf the player collected enough money to save the circus, the performers get their revenge on Freddy by launching a portly diva with a seesaw, crushing Freddy.\nIf the player failed to get enough money, the circus is demolished and a building labeled as Freddy Towers is erected in its place.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2s4k.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mindscape, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gray Matter","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":12096,"name":"Fightin' Spirit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fightin' Spirit is a one-on-one beat 'em up centred around a competition by a gang overlord to find new heavies for his organisation.

The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's height and three bombs.\n\nThe bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like \"S\" power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn \"B\" icons that increases the player's bomb stock when destroyed.\nEvery time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player's total score.\n\nPlayers are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Completing the last stage restarts the game with the second loop increasing in difficulty.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ovw.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ving Co., Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Images Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Graftgold","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Romstar","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Toaplan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Firebird","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Software Creations","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Banana Development","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kaneko","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Catalyst Coders","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"}]},{"id":12107,"name":"The Fool's Errand","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The fool's errand is a puzzle game that makes heavy use of a story based on the tarot deck.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7j70.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Miles Computing, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Synergistic Software, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":12108,"name":"Frost Byte","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Frost Byte you control Hickey the Kreezer, an elastic curve which moves sideways, jumps and shoots.

Typing help or h in the command line would give a clue as to what the valid password is. Since initial attempts at entry would consist of guessing (and likely failing) access would eventually be granted to the player due a malfunction in the security system, thus allowing the player entry. Once admittance has been made, the player is then asked to identify various parts of a robot unit, by pointing the cursor at the relevant parts and pressing the fire button. Most parts of the unit have exotic and technical names, such as \"asynchronous data compactor\" or \"phlamson joint\" -- this again, allows for more room of error by initially trying to guessing which part each name belongs to. Failure to identify each part correctly and without any error, forces the player to take a retest until a 100 percent identification is made, at which point, the player is then allowed to continue. \nThe player guides this robot, as seen on the Apple II version of the game, through the extensive network of underground tunnels. \n \nThe player gains control of the robot which can travel around the globe via secret tunnels, deep within the earth.

The player is warned it must be retrieved in order to prevent the US government from thwarting their plans. At this point, the player's objective is clear: retrieve the strips of the stolen document, but then deliver them to Washington DC. \n \nThe robot's tunnel system is extensive, but unmarked, so getting around is initially an exercise in trial and error.

(Conveniently for the text-only game, these runes look strangely like ASCII characters.) After years of painstaking research, Ellington managed to decipher a portion of the text, which indicated the general location of a pyramid that no one had heard of before. He managed to organize a modest expedition to the area in 1920, but found nothing before he died except a small block of limestone bearing the same style of hieroglyphics. According to the partial translation he made, the new fragment spoke of a queen and great riches. When Howard Carter discovered King Tut's tomb a few years later, Dr. Ellington's widow figured that someone had found the pyramid her husband had been looking for. She stowed the papers and artifacts away and forgot all about them. Rose found them in the early 1980s after her mother's death and did some preliminary fact-checking. The pyramid indicated by her father's papers is nowhere near Tut's. In fact, no pyramids have ever been discovered in the area Dr. Ellington was investigating. Rose is by no means a rich woman—she only wants someone to give her father the recognition he deserves—so it'll be a modest expedition.

It was the first game in the Metal Gear series for the PSP. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile.\n\nAcid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character's movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \"Active Command Intelligence Duel\". The cards are not truly collectable, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs.\n\nBefore each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. Most cards are based on elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player's hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher.\n\nCost is an important factor in gameplay and can be summed up as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 15 and a guard has a cost of 10, then the guard's turn would occur before the character's.\n\nSome cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don't need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however, they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards.\n\nMultiplayer, or \"Link Battle\", is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running Acid can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a \"sneak-off\". The objective is to collect several diskettes before the rival player. Diskettes can be stolen by another player, so there is an emphasis on avoiding detection.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pnu.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami Computer Entertainment Japan","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":12212,"name":"Metal Gear Solid Touch","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Metal Gear Solid Touch is a third-person shooter video game for iOS based on Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.\n\nThe player navigates through several missions based on stages from Metal Gear Solid 4, each introduced by brief text summarizing the story so far. The player moves their finger across the screen to aim, tapping to fire, and moving their fingers together or apart to zoom in or out with a sniper rifle, removing their fingers from the screen to get behind cover and avoid enemy fire. The main character's primary weapons, an assault rifle and a sniper rifle, can be rotated with one another by pinching the device's screen.\n\nThe player plays as Solid Snake, who is also known as Old Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4. The entirety of Metal Gear Solid has been streamlined into a portable and more accessible form. The main objective of most missions is to kill a set number of enemies. Enemies include hostile PMC soldiers, Haven Troopers and Gekkos, which are unmanned fighting machinations. There are also friendly targets which the player is penalised for shooting at. Some sections contain 'Boss fights', where the player fights a boss from the Metal Gear Solid 4 storyline; e.g. Laughing Octopus. At the end of each mission, the player is awarded a rank based on their precision and speed in completing the mission. Higher ranks award more Drebin Points, which can be used to buy rewards such as iPhone character wallpapers.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dmi.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kojima Productions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":12216,"name":"Rack N Ruin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Chaos reigns in this top down action adventure game starring Rack, a demon with an appetite for destruction.

It is a horizontally scrolling game taking place over eight levels, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours (red, blue, and green) to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, can navigate between the levels through portals. At first the wizard only has access to the first three levels, but completing levels gains access to further levels. Each level has bouncing spheres of a different colours, and shooting them releases droplets, which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the correct colours. On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, further adding to the challenge.\n\nThe wizard himself is not capable of collecting paint droplets, and is initially capable of very limited movement, bouncing up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after next touching the ground. Collecting green pearls (which appear when some sprites have been shot) gives the player tokens which can be used to \"buy\" enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower, and also a companion known as Catellite. Catellite (ostensibly the wizard's cat) is also spherical in form. It normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which also renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets; the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player. As well as droplets of colours, sometimes droplets of other colours also appear, having various effects. These include:\n\nLight blue - causes a \"filth raid\", where a wave of fast-moving enemies appear, shooting bullets at the player.\nGrey - changes Catellite into an \"Indestructacat\", making it invulnerable to enemies.\nWhite - gives an extra life.\nPurple - changes Catellite into a \"mutant cat\", causing it to disobey the player's controls.\nBlack - causes \"freaky bits\", turning most of the scenery black.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7j5v.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ocean Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sensible Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":12235,"name":"Xenon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Xenon is a 1988 vertical scrolling shooter computer game, developed by The Bitmap Brothers and published by Melbourne House which was then owned by Mastertronic.

You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages.
