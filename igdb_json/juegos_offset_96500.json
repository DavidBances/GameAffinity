The goal of the game is to clear layers of very sharp blades to push the open button. Push all the buttons in order and you win. While trying to open the puzzle you must not touch the sharp edges of the blades or you will get SLICED. When this happens, blood spills from your finger(s) onto the glass and the puzzle will reset. The blades only move in specific patterns that you must intuit by touch. Often you will have to use multiple fingers to hold blades open while you manipulate other blades with other fingers. This game is really about trying to figure out the hidden behaviors of the blades and moving the blades out of the way, carefully.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":104492,"name":"Enchanted Kingdom: A Dark Seed","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Can you heal the kingdom?","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4drq.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104493,"name":"LEGO DC Mighty Micros","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co734y.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104494,"name":"Geometry Darkness","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104495,"name":"Clash Caddie","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104496,"name":"My Town : Street Fun","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104497,"name":"Sweet Baby Girl Cleanup 6","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nopvyjeonzmalmk4jthi.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"TutoTOONS","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":104498,"name":"Robot Fighting 2: Minibots","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this game you can create your own armoured car minibot in the garage and upgrade its properties to make it to the try-out and become a member of the mech robot wars League!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dus.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Fighting","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":104499,"name":"Elifoot 18","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104500,"name":"Word Build - Word Search Games","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104501,"name":"Soccer Kick","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104502,"name":"Relaxing Waves","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104503,"name":"Ancient Spirits: Columbus' Legacy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A mysterious ghost story, a gripping thriller, a historical hidden object adventure.

The gameplay is similar to that of the Puzzle League series, but with a more traditional Tetris-like gameplay where pieces fall from the top of the screen. Pieces come in three colors: red, yellow, and blue. Pieces commonly have a star on one end, or occasionally, a star on two ends. The aim of the game is to clear blocks from the playing field, by matching stars from same-coloured blocks. Players are rewarded for creating combos (which are called 'links') of piece clearances. The game ends when someone's piece level reaches the top of the playfield and is not cleared after three seconds. The one player 'story' mode revolves around moving around an island and playing against opponents who gradually become harder, and consists of playing against 9 opponents (although this can be adjusted). There are also activities that involve the player concentrating on a specific task within a time limit. These include getting a high score, a high number of links, surviving for as long as possible, and clearing a field in a short time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9bcb.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Axela","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco Limited","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":104780,"name":"Reversi Quest","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":104781,"name":"Chase: Distant Memories","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104782,"name":"CastleStorm: Virtual Reality","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104783,"name":"Ancient Amuletor: Into the Ice","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This DLC will unlock the 5th hero-Kane the Viking, and two new maps with new theme settings.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2upj.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":104784,"name":"Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Legacy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1u9m.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":104785,"name":"Cannibal","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Live the life of a survivor who lost his parents at age 12 and was adopted by the wily Mr. Francis.
