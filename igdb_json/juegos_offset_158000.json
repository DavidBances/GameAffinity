Go South into Portbury docks and take in the magnificent Clifton Suspension Bridge or take a heavy freight load past Filton Airport, where Concorde G-BOAF resides opposite the magnificent Brabazon hangars.\n\nDo you feel like taking a trip back to the past? Drive to the Bristol Harbour Railway where you can travel up and down the dockside railway and see Brunel's famous SS Great Britain and the M Shed Museum which occupies the former Bristol Industrial Museum building.\n\nOr maybe you'd prefer a trip into the future? Portishead railway station is subject to a great deal of debate at the moment with ongoing campaigns to re-open the line and its stations at Pill and Portishead to ease traffic on the A369. The line has been included, with the station at Pill bought back to life and the lines laid and station buildings placed at Portishead station.\n\nIf you want to do some good old fashioned shunting, there's plenty of scope for that too, with the docks at Avonmouth and Portbury, coaling yards at Avonmouth, and shunting yards at Stoke Gifford and east of Bristol Temple Meads.\n\nBristol and Avonmouth includes a total of 21 stations and features 15 scenarios, ten using default stock, and five using stock from Just Trains, as well as four Free Roams.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mmz.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Just Trains","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":136418,"name":"Yoshi in Sonic the Hedgehog 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Yoshi in Sonic 2 is a ROMhack/mod of Sonic The Hedgehog 2.

This game is also much less gory than similar Sega arcade titles - when shot, enemies simply dissolve into dust.\n\nThe game has three different stages, and players can select their own route during play, resulting in many different ways to complete the game. Various quick-time events occur in the course of the game, such as \"Shoot the arch to block enemies,\" \"Battle your secret rival,\" \"Shoot down the incoming energy balls,\" and \"Shoot the driver of the car\". When this occurs, a \"Shoot\" prompt appears on screen, telling the player to shoot the target objects marked with red circles. If the player succeeds, 1000 pts. are awarded and enemy attacks are avoided.\n\nIf the player fails, he/she will have to battle many enemies or take damage. If there are two players, they may earn extra points by performing \"co-op shots\" on enemies. At the end of each level is a unique boss - a possessed god from traditional Chinese culture. Their weak points are revealed in the form of on-screen prompts before the boss battle begins. This game has the unique feature of allowing players to buy and upgrade additional lives, weapons, and shields with the points earned during gameplay.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4a4t.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Shanghai Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":124292,"name":"Speed Driver 3: Crash Hour","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yzj.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"International Games System, Co., LTD.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":120626,"name":"Dark Tales: Edgar Allan Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In 19th century France, detective Auguste Dupin is summoned to Paris, called to investigate the brutal murder of Madame L'Espanaye and the kidnapping of her sister Camille.

The idea is to blend two genres, Beat’em all Action and RPG, combining character progression, immersion, equipment collection, additional quests and a solid storyline with rhythmic combat sequences, a sense of power from the beginning of the game and of course QTE and bosses with sequential behaviour.\nThis combination leads to a true innovative gameplay supported by many other key features : you can choose between two characters whose different stories intertwine and whose skills vary.\nThe game’s environment has been designed to be an asset in itself, or an important part of the gameplay, with lighting effects which create unprecedented combat situations.\nThe world created for Mars has been designed to offer a true voyage in the heart of a totally new universe mingling decadent futuristic technology and precarious survival on a planet with highly extreme conditions.\nThe storyline leads you to discover your own identity in a web of political intrigue and complex conflicts between forces, allowing you to better understand the world you are travelling. Many scripted sequences give rise to the action and storyline, creating unforgettable moments.\n\n- Combat\nThe combat phases are dynamic and spectacular no matter your level of implication during the quests.\nMost confrontations are brief : you move from one enemy to the other striking or throwing spells one after the\nother. Combat against the bosses or champions lasts longer though, as you must use different tactics to beat them.\nAs you can also modify your environment by breaking part of a roof or moving metal plates to use light as a weapon, the fights gain a more strategic dimension.\nPlaying the role of Pandora is as intense as playing Seth. To make her cast her most powerful spells a precise timing is required as well as constant movement to avoid being interrupted. Even though she is less powerful she is more agile, and just like the warrior needs his weapons, she is nothing without her gauntlets which allow her to canalize her fluid.\nAll enemies, if wounded enough, can be finished off in a spectacular way.\n\n- Two characters : two stories and two forms of gameplay\nMars allows you to choose between two characters with different skills and\nAbilities : Seth, is an elite soldier and highly skilled fighter who tends to act brutally even if athletically. As he progresses in the game he can learn many special attacks and how to master new weapons.\nPandora on the other hand is a technomancer who handles fluids with catalyst gauntlets to produce devastating magic. But more than just using different skills, playing each character results in a different control and gameplay. Their story varies a lot even though it follows a similar course, allowing you to discover two versions of Mars.\n\n- Light effects\nOn Mars sunlight is deadly, which means you can use it during combat to beat your enemies. Seth and Pandora can make gaps in rooftops of different buildings they are fighting on to expose their opponents to sunrays, use mirrors to reflect light on them or push them away from the protection of shady paths.\nYou can modify the architecture of the environment during combat while making sure your character is not exposed to sunrays and watch out for shadows moving position around the sun’s movement. The impact the sun has on the gameplay provides a new feature not only during combat but during the entire game itself.\n\n- A new world\nThe Mars universe is unprecedented, not at all like normal mythological or fantasy worlds, offering a journey in a credible futuristic world where survival and the ability to adapt are keys to be able to withstand a hostile, desperate and decadent environment. The game’s story, complex political system and religion, as well as its many creatures and different inhabitants lead you through an unforgettable journey in an \"extraterrestrial\" world.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dcb.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Spiders","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":85781,"name":"Thomas and Friends: Misty Island Rescue","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A game based on the movie.
