The remaining population resides in the last \"green\" city, a sanctuary shielded from the desolate wastelands that cover the rest of the planet.\n\nTo select the most skilled and resourceful individuals for a crucial space mission, the city's leaders organize an intense competition known as the \"Galactic Gauntlet: The Ultimate Interstellar Challenge.\" This competition consists of a series of grueling obstacle courses designed to test the physical abilities, problem-solving skills, and mental fortitude of the participants.\n\nAs a promising candidate, you enter the Galactic Gauntlet, aiming to prove yourself worthy of joining the elite team of explorers who will embark on the interstellar journey to find a new home for humanity. The obstacle courses are not only physically demanding but also simulate the challenges and dangers that await in space, such as zero gravity zones, asteroid fields, and complex puzzles.\n\nThroughout the competition, you'll face fierce rivals, uncover hidden secrets about the mission, and make critical choices that will determine your fate and the fate of humanity. Only the most skilled and resilient will earn a place on the space mission, where they will venture into the unknown to secure a future for mankind.\n\nIn this intense competition, players will navigate through treacherous obstacle courses, each designed to test their agility and quick-thinking. You'll need to dodge, jump, and strategize your way past various hazards that threaten to send you back to the last checkpoint you passed. Your ultimate goal? To ascend the leaderboards, outpace your rivals, and etch your name in the annals of the Galactic Gauntlet as the fastest, most cunning competitor in this ultimate interstellar challenge. With each run, you'll hone your skills, learn the nuances of each course, and strive for that flawless run that will secure your place among the stars.\n\nThe game's controls are designed to be intuitive and responsive, giving players a sense of agility and precision as they navigate the courses. You can run, sprint to gain speed, slide under obstacles, leap over gaps, and even master the art of wall scaling by deftly jumping back and forth between surfaces. These mechanics not only add depth to the gameplay but also allow for a wide range of movements that make each attempt at a course a thrilling and unique experience. Mastery of these controls is key to making swift progress, avoiding setbacks, and ultimately dominating the leaderboards with grace and style.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7p76.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Dads in Dungeons Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":284730,"name":"Twerk Hero: Lil Nas X","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Twerk something to “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” in Lil Nas X's Twerk Hero Game!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7p7a.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":284731,"name":"Hazardous Materials","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are Gordon Freeman...\n\nIt was a normal working day.
