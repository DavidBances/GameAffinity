However, this is not enough because - depending on the damage taken - it first has to be built up again. The time this takes depend on various factors, e.g. what other near targets are available, and can be sped up with supply drops by transport aircraft. Available ground installments also have other effects, e.g. the availability of ammo or troops.\n\nThe majority of of the action is fought in the air with World War II aircraft, but there are also ground (e.g. tanks) and naval vehicles available. The matches itself are of a grand scale and can take multiple hours; afterwards the map is reset. Overall the controls are somewhere between simulation and action. Depending on the arena, which can also be crafted with the editor, the exact winning conditions can be slightly different. While the multiplayer matches are subscription-based, there is also a free offline mode for training included.\n\nIn the years after release, the game was under continuous development and saw many minor and major changes.

Also, he will make contact with three bureaucrats who will make his task harder, but they can also be pushed of the edge of platforms, giving Dust Brain plenty of time to bounce around before the bureaucrats have the chance to resurrect themselves. \n \nEach Madball has its own speed and strength, and it can be difficult for a strong Madball to fall off a platform.

These include combining archaic technology such as biplanes with more advanced machinery; firing and power-up system; and a medal collecting system which drastically increases scoring. The game features a similar method of earning bombs and a delay when launching them as well.\n\nA notable feature of Ibara is the inclusion of a variable, real-time difficulty system by way of the Rank system. The player's rank increases as they acquire more items and cause more damage, increasing the difficulty of the game along with it. The number of enemies does not increase but the number of bullets fired towards the user does, often reaching a ridiculous level of bullet density.\n\nThere are ways of lowering this rank system if the odds appear too much. The only known way of decreasing the player's Rank in Ibara is to die.

Bones litter the floor, and tiny beasts you've never seen pick at the remaining flesh. You hear the clanging of armor, the grinding of bones, and the maniacal screams of death approaching. \n \nAs you pull yourself to your feet, you notice that you're standing next to a dismembered corpse. His organs are spewed all over the surrounding area. You don't know where you are, or how you got here, but you do know two things: You're getting out, and you aren't going to end up like him. \n \nDestroy the demons, vanquish the undead, and escape the inferno... or become another bloodstain on the wall. \n \nInferno is an exciting arcade/adventure that will test your reflexes, your mind and your courage. \nBoth the enemies and the levels themselves will become part of your worst nightmares. \n \nThe game uses the ASCII 8 mapper.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/c2gjurarvrmwdblemk6s.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Aetherbyte","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX2"}]},{"id":91851,"name":"Hard Hat","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this Maze game the letters forming the word \"Hard Hat\" are scattered throughout the maze.
