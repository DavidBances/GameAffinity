The player controls a fighter at the bottom of the screen, which can only move from side to side. Shots can be fired at a diagonal, as well as straight, by twisting the joystick from side to side. At certain stages, ground targets will appear and can be destroyed by using the \"Burn\" button. The laser disc generated backgrounds are largely non-interactive during game play. They form the backgrounds on which the game is played on. Scenes do work in with the backgrounds, however that is the extent. Some backgrounds appear as they should have elements of interactively, however, were not used in the release of the game. These include scenes where the player is going through an asteroid field and asteroids fly towards the player. Another scene is in the crystal caverns, where there are many obstacles which could have been made to be avoided. These are only two of many scenes which could have had interactive elements. The game may have been decided to have been too hard to play with these background obstacles and computer fighters to play. Hence removing the background interactively to make the game more playable. The game starts with the player in Frald Rancer's home city, then taking off into outer space via a fly-by of the city. The backgrounds are very Sci-Fi and are fantasy themed. They are very interesting, more so than the game. The music from the laser disc also complements the laser disc video very well and makes up for the sometimes annoying, computer generated sounds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/l6lb62g3tmjsf6exkmmo.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":24504,"name":"Cliff Hanger","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cliff Hanger is a laserdisc video game that was released by Stern Electronics in 1983.

Lend an ear...\n\nYou will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:\n\nTHE SEAGULL:\nPeriodically, a seagull will fly overhead. You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color. Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid. This is the best way to gain points. Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.\n\nTHE SLIP:\nAnother great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him \"the slip\". If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave. Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately. As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.\n\nSCORING:\nPoints are earned in a variety of ways. Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points. The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.\n\nAlso, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave. And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co988x.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":22731,"name":"Gold Fever","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Platformer in which you have to collect piles of gold.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mk43cneuf6dj0mcqsfc4.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore VIC-20"}]},{"id":22730,"name":"Deadly Skies","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Airforce Delta Storm, known as Airforce Delta II in Japan and simply as Deadly Skies in Europe, is a fighter jet video game released in 2001 for the Xbox.

The player controlled the titular character, Major Rex Havoc, first in the \"shoot-'em-up\" style game, in which the player operated Major Havoc's spaceship, the Catastrofighter, against the numerous robot ships who defend the enemy reactors. The ships are encased in a sort of \"buckyball\" force-field shield which must be shot first before the ship can be killed. In the next phase, the player would land on the robot space-station by centering the Catastrofighter in between the moving white line and Major Havoc would exit his ship and enter the space-station. The roller-knob controlled left and right character movement and a \"jump\" button permitted the player's character to leap over obstacles. Thus, a minor amount of \"gravity\" interacted with the player. The object was to get to the core of the space-station unmolested and sabotage the reactor.

The larger ships have cloaking devices which make them invisible. Damage is inflicted on ships when they are shot or rammed by other ships.\n\nUniquely for the time, the player vessel remains locked in the centre of the screen and the world rotates and moves around it. Player shots also have limited range and are subject to the same rotation as everything else, which means the player needs to predict where shots will need to go in order to hit the enemies. The ship has both long range scanners and shields but may only use one at a time. By default, the game will automatically switch between them based on the proximity of enemy vessels but the player can optionally take full control.\n\nUsing shields, thrusting, turning and firing all use up energy which is also depleted when hit by enemies. Energy will automatically replenish, most quickly if the shields are off and the starship is not moving, but this leaves the player open to attack.\n\nUnusually, the player is never expected to return their ship from the frontiers. Each individual voyage is a separate command, and lasts either until the player's vessel is destroyed or until they use an escape capsule. If the escape capsule is successfully launched, which means firing it so that it doesn't collide with any enemy ships, and the player is judged by Star-Fleet to have killed enough enemies during his command then he is given a new commission and a new and visually different ship. 8 points are scored for a small ship and 12 for a large ship. Starfleet's opinion of the player's performance ranges from them being \"furious\" to \"delighted\". The number of points required to reach the next level is not fixed. Sometimes a score of 60 will suffice and sometimes a score of 80 will not be enough to guarantee automatic promotion to the next level, assuming the escape capsule was jettisoned safely. Strangely, more points were awarded when an escape capsule collided with and destroyed an enemy ship as opposed to being shot or colliding with the starship.\n\nLater commands take place in faster environments and with greater numbers of enemy. There are 8 different starship designs, which repeat after level 8.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/n9dooqu6pjloz4gshkis.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Acorn Electron"},{"id":0,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"}]},{"id":13751,"name":"Rocket Raid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rocket Raid it is a side scrolling shoot 'em up and a variant of Scramble.

(Conveniently for the text-only game, these runes look strangely like ASCII characters.) After years of painstaking research, Ellington managed to decipher a portion of the text, which indicated the general location of a pyramid that no one had heard of before. He managed to organize a modest expedition to the area in 1920, but found nothing before he died except a small block of limestone bearing the same style of hieroglyphics. According to the partial translation he made, the new fragment spoke of a queen and great riches. When Howard Carter discovered King Tut's tomb a few years later, Dr. Ellington's widow figured that someone had found the pyramid her husband had been looking for. She stowed the papers and artifacts away and forgot all about them. Rose found them in the early 1980s after her mother's death and did some preliminary fact-checking. The pyramid indicated by her father's papers is nowhere near Tut's. In fact, no pyramids have ever been discovered in the area Dr. Ellington was investigating. Rose is by no means a rich woman—she only wants someone to give her father the recognition he deserves—so it'll be a modest expedition.

It is essentially a mix between two Namco games; Pac-Man and Rally X. \n \nIt is the sequel to Head-On, which was released a year before Puck-Man. However, Pacar is more-so a clone of Puck-Man than a true Head-On sequel. \n \nThe player controls \"Pacar\", a \"mischievous\" green car through a maze of roads. The objective of the game is to \"delete\" all of the small red \"dots\" scattered around the playfield, building up points for a high score. The joystick allows Pacar to move in the proposed direction, assuming it is possible to do so. Like Pac-Man, Pacar does not stop moving unless it hits a wall, however unlike Pac-Man, it is not possible to rotate 180 degrees on the spot - moving in the opposite direction causes Pacar to reverse, and reversing is significantly slower than driving normally. Ideally the player should plan his or her route to avoid reversing altogether. \n \n1 or 2 allows Pacar to move faster across the board. Driving off the edge of the screen makes Pacar appear at the other side, again similar to Pac-Man. \n \nThe game has Pacar avoid two types of enemy, also depicted as cars. Blue cars spawn from the garage at the centre of the screen and wander around the play area, only following Pacar if it is close by. Red cars spawn randomly on the road behind Pacar, and are much more aggressive with their tactics. Red cars also differ in that if Pacar speeds up, they will also increase their speed. If either car crashes into Pacar under normal conditions, the player loses a life. \n \nUnder certain conditions the game's equivalent of Pac Man's power pellets appear after deleting smaller dots. These give Pacar \"temporary invincibility\" turning it purple in the process, and act as the only form of attack against oppoents. While purple, the player is free to crash into as many cars as he or she likes, and is granted extra points in the process (starting at 200 and doubling for each successive hit, i.e. 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 etc.). It will also slow down red cars. Though there are typically fewer enemies on-screen in Pacar than Pac-Man, the fact that blue cars spawn from the garage instantly after being deleted means it is possible to achieve much higher point combos. \n \nThere are only two maps in Pacar, which cycle endlessly until the player dies. The game claims it is \"three dimensional\" as some roads in map 1 act as bridges over other roads. Once both maps are completed the player proceeds to the next \"round\", in which more blue cars are added to the playfield (with the exception of round 4, in which the three \"normal\" blue cars are replaced with one faster blue car. Round 5 will then add a second faster car and so on). \n \nExtra lives are awarded every 10,000 points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s22blbmsivtcforiqfvp.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"SG-1000"}]},{"id":6103,"name":"Chack'n Pop","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Chack'n Pop is considered a predecessor of Bubble Bobble.

If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny. \n \nEach level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear. \n \nEach level of game play consists of two phases: \n \n1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. \n \n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. \n \nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/um4pbj9e6gym0rpgkp4y.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":2218,"name":"Lilly Adventure","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/of1vs2qo8xxhdavli6xh.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":1630,"name":"James Bond 007","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"When it comes to fast-paced action and intrigue, nobody does it better than Bond.

There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.\n\nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.\n\nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks.

In the game, Jetman has to destroy alien bases whilst simultaneously defending himself, along with Earth, from a hostile alien race.\n\nLunar Jetman was Ultimate Play The Game's first game to require 48K of RAM - all previous games had run on unexpanded 16K models. The game was written by Chris Stamper with graphics designed by Tim Stamper. The game was followed by a third instalment, Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship, released for the NES in 1990. The game was met with critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its addictive gameplay and wide range of colours. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co50f0.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":6104,"name":"Exerion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Exerion is a vertical shoot 'em up released by Jaleco in 1983 and licensed to Taito for distribution in the United States.\n\nScreenshot from arcade version\nExerion is a shoot 'em up game featuring parallax effects and inertia simulation, something notable for 1983.

It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz).\n\nAt first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two \"arrows\", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a \"season\" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.\n\nAlong the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.\n\nEvery so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.\n\nThe player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co306z.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":1088,"name":"Donkey Kong 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Stanley is a bugman.

The game had a parser that understood over 700 words, making it the most advanced interactive fiction game of its time. It was Infocom's ninth game.\n\nKrill, an incredibly powerful evil warlock, is spreading chaos and destruction. None of the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters dare to attempt to stop him. In desperation, the player, a novice Enchanter with only a few weak spells in his spell book, is sent in hopes that Krill will either fail to detect him or dismiss him as harmless. More powerful spells can be found on scrolls hidden in various locations, but as the player becomes more of a threat, Krill will respond accordingly.\n\nThis game features an innovative new spell system based partially on Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series and partially Dungeons and Dragons' Vancian spell system, where spells must be prepared through \"memorization\" before being cast. As in the Earthsea series, each spell is represented by some nonsense \"magic word\" which is treated as a verb by the game's text parser, so that one can use the FROTZ spell (which causes objects to glow and give off light) by typing >FROTZ BOOK, in exactly the same way as one might type >PICK UP BOOK or >READ BOOK.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5b80.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"TRS-80"},{"id":0,"name":"TRS-80 Color Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad PCW"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":40697,"name":"Save Our Ship","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You're the captain of a capital ship, sailing the Spanish Main.

It plays a lot like the American board game Connect Four, in which the goal is to line up a series of five tiles horizontally, vertically or diagonally before the other player can do the same. Two players take it in turns to place a single Go tile on the board, attempting to craft their own lines while strategically placing tiles that blocks the opponent from finishing theirs.\n\nWhile the normal board game is simply referred to as \"Gomoku Narabe\" (Five Pieces in a Row, occasionally translated as Gobang), the Renju modifier is an additional rule that makes it harder for the player with the black pieces to win. Because the black player always begins each game (like how the white player always begins each game of Chess), this additional rule is thought to even the playing field. The rule is that the black player will lose if they build a line of six or more pieces: this counts as going \"overlong\" and counts as a loss.\n\nGomoku Narabe Renju is the fourth video game ever released on the Famicom, and the first original game produced for the system (the previous three - Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye - were all ports of arcade games).

You take control of goofy as he competes in two events, the Marathon Dive and the Pogo Pop. \n \nThe Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out. As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around. Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level). Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over. If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life. \n \nIf Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air. Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below. However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough. If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion). If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim). As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically. Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again. \n \nPogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile. This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land. As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.  \n \nWhile you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points. The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zn2gajypfpwjfmzivqsp.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"}]},{"id":6140,"name":"Star Jacker","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Star Jacker is an early vertical scrolling shooter with some interesting characteristics.

Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo's spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted.\n\nFirst Officer Piggy's level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time.\n\nThe final level is Dr. Strangepork's, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek's boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5ylq.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":40442,"name":"Stinger","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Horizontal space shooter","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co82dk.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":40914,"name":"Rolloverture","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The hall is at a hush The maestro takes the baton and readies the orchestra.

The player's man can scale ladders and ropes, hang overhead from horizontal ropes, and hop from flying carpet to flying carpet (similar to Frogger's river logs) to navigate each level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ns8.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":4599,"name":"Elevator Action","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Elevator Action is a 1983 arcade game by Taito.
