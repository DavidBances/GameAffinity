In Patch Land, Kirby's body transforms into yarn, rendering his power to inhale useless. Instead, Kirby is granted the ability to transform by the magic of the Metamato, which he uses to rescue a boy being attacked by a monster. The boy, named Prince Fluff, explains that Yin-Yarn has separated Patch Land into pieces, which was tied together by magic yarn. Kirby decides to help Prince Fluff collect all seven pieces of the yarn and restore Patch Land.\n\nMeanwhile, Yin-Yarn captures King Dedede and Meta Knight and places them under his control. Kirby is forced to fight Dedede and Meta Knight after they ambush him in Patch Land. When Kirby and Prince Fluff finally collect all the Magic Yarn, Meta Knight, no longer under the sorceror's influence, informs Kirby that Yin-Yarn is turning Dream Land into fabric. Prince Fluff produces the second sock, its magic fully restored, and uses it to transport Kirby and himself to Dream Land; now completely made of yarn. Kirby confronts and defeats Yin-Yarn, breaking the spell and returning Dream Land and himself back to normal. Prince Fluff parts with Kirby, stating that he can visit Patch Land anytime via Yin-Yarn's magic sock.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1w9w.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Good-Feel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":2154,"name":"Cities XL 2011","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Imagine and conceive cities of all types and sizes on Cities XL planet.

The game takes place over five aerial stages where the goal is to survive for five minutes (stage 4) or defeat all enemies (all other stages). In normal mode stages unlock sequentially, and each stage has a set vehicle and co-pilot. Upon completing normal mode hard mode stages are unlocked, which have hardier and more aggressive enemies as well as the ability to use all vehicles, pilots, optional gear, and co-pilots in the game. The player can also toggle flight controls between Normal, where the Valkyrie jet mode moves similarly to its bipedal modes, or Real, where the jet can bank and spin like an actual aircraft. In combat Valkyries and the Large Varja units can shift between their different forms by tapping a direction on the right stick. The Queadluun-Rhea does not have alternate forms, but can still change between high speed and maneuverability modes. Units will have a primary weapon (typically a rifle), and a secondary weapon (typically missiles), a melee attack, and speed boost. Weapons have unlimited ammunition, but limited magazines, and must be reloaded when depleted. All units can dash in a direction to break missile locks by double tapping, and shoot down missiles automatically with the missile defense move as long as they have remaining Anti gauge. A Special bar is replenished by gaining sequential hits on targets, and can be expended to increase boost, turn melee into a charging tackle, unleash the vehicle's unique ultimate attack, or activate the co-pilot's special ability. Upon finishing the stage the player is graded on the number of enemies shot down, as well as time and health remaining.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co754b.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":65418,"name":"8-Bit Mini Mayhem","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An online game by Sony just before Ratchet * Clank\nAll 4 one","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5uvn.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment America","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":56771,"name":"Kana: Imouto","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kana: Imouto is a Japanese PSP game by CyberFront.\nOne of the most riveting visual novels ever created, Kana ~ Little Sister is a story from the famous Tanaka Romeo, creator of Yume Miru Kusuri and Family Project.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6wxi.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CyberFront","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Regista","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":44582,"name":"Ken to Mahou to Gakuen Mono. 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Released in Japan in 2010.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ys3.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ZeroDiv","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ACQUIRE Corp.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":42784,"name":"Ace Armstrong vs. The Alien Scumbags!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ace Armstrong vs. the Alien Scumbags! is a fast-paced horizontally scrolling shooter with a unique, slapstick take on the best of 50s and 60s sci-fi movies and cartoons.
