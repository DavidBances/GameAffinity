The game received negative reviews; criticism focused on the game's repetition and monotony. The girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller.

The player moves around the screen shooting at star-shaped Mines of various sizes and mannerisms. Each screen has many dots, which can potentially turn into Mines; once a Mine is shot, two dots on the screen will turn into medium-sized Mines, which will then turn into two small Mines when shot (note: for the most part; sometimes, perhaps due to a glitch, a medium-sized Mine will just hatch one small Mine).

Paratroopers are jumping down from those helicopters; if four or more of them touch the ground, they will form a human ladder, climb up to the turret, and destroy it.

To counter that, the player can either eliminate the plane before it has the chance to drop the bomb, or destroy the bomb itself in mid-air. Shooting bombs scores the most points (50).\n\nSurviving this stage effectively puts the game on an indefinite loop, with more helicopter and bomber plane stages alternating with increased difficulty.

Energy can be picked up as well, which will either restore lost health or, at full health, power up the attack of the ZIG and SYDs.\n\nThe arcade version uses a rotary joystick to control the turret, but the PlayStation port places the turret controls on the shoulder buttons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ivle8qv3g4oow3a63ct6.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":22556,"name":"Worm War I","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Your mission, as a master tank commander, is to drive through the city of Teriyaki and blast away as many Worms and Blocks as possible without running out of fuel.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/inafnktzqyabhwv3fn5m.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"}]},{"id":22498,"name":"Mars Cars","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A action game in which the player controls a vehicle through mazes on Mars while avoiding the vicious Mars Cars and collecting Martian treasures.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ox2.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":22496,"name":"SubRoc 3D","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"SubRoc 3-D is a shooter, where you look through a periscope and shoot at both sea and air-targets.

Perhaps the best-remembered of all TI-99/4A games, it is a side-scrolling shooter, programmed in 1982 by Jim Dramis (who also programmed the popular TI-99/4A games Car Wars and Munch Man) and Paul Urbanus.\n\nThe player in Parsec pilots a spaceship through sixteen differently-colored levels of play which scroll horizontally over the screen. The objective is to avoid being shot by an enemy ship, colliding with any flying object and/or the ground, and destroy all enemy ships without overheating one's laser cannon.\n\nThree waves of fighters attack, alternating with three waves of cruisers. Enemy ships enter the screen one at a time. A ship flying off the left edge of the screen wraps around to the right side and attacks again. A new fighter can appear with others still on the screen, whereas a new cruiser will not come until the previous one is destroyed. The fighters pose only the threat of collision, while the cruisers fire on the player's ship. The fighter types are named Swoopers, LTFs (Light Triangular Fighters), and Saucers. The cruisers are called Urbites, Dramites, and Bynites. Each level ends with an asteroid belt, in which an array of asteroids advance on the ship and must be avoided or shot. At the end of each asteroid belt, any remaining asteroids are cleared away and the color of the ground is changed, then a new wave of Swoopers begins. Starting with level 4, the Swoopers are preceded by a random number of Killer Satellites, which come without the usual computer warning.\n\nThe Urbites and Dramites appear to be named after the developers of the game, while the Bynites were apparently named after Don Bynum (the manager of TI's Personal Computer Division) or possibly named after the fact that they have invisibility (by night). In fact, Paul Urbanus signed Internet posts as late as 2005 as \"urbite\".","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ap4ltb42lektozl2kwkp.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Texas Instruments TI-99"}]},{"id":18560,"name":"Picnic Paranoia","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Armed with a fly swatter the player guards four picnic tables and has to fend of an invasion of insects trying to steal the food placed on the tables.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/veqggv7p3eipxwpzi23m.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Texas Instruments TI-99"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"}]},{"id":18559,"name":"Turmoil","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player controls a space ship which is trapped in an area consisting of seven tunnels which are connected by a vertical shaft.

There is also gender-reversed version of the game titled Philly Flasher that features identical gameplay. Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em has received negative reception since its release and is an oft-cited example of pornographic Atari 2600 games.\nPlayers control two nude women on the street who must catch semen in their mouths that comes from a masturbating man on a rooftop without missing. This can be accomplished merely by touching the women's bodies on the sperm before it hits the ground. A more difficult setting requires players catch the sperm before it goes past the women's shoulders. If any sperm hits the ground, the first turn is over. Players are allowed to miss four times before the game is over. They can gain a turn every 69 points scored (up to two extra turns). Players move both women using the controller's paddle and the game allows each player to control one woman.

On the right, a paddle (said to be a container of aphrodisiac \"Spanish Fly\" in the manual) returns the depleted bachelor to the room full of women.

The equally unclothed bachelor is propelled repeatedly into the room of women by a container of \"Spanish Fly\" used as the player's paddle. When entering the fray, the bachelor's exaggerated and pixelated penis is seen to be erect. When he returns from having collided with (and presumably had sexual intercourse with) a woman or after hitting the opposing wall, his penis sags. It returns to erect when the bachelor is successfully set moving again toward the left.\nA second version of the game, titled Bachelorette Party, also exists.

Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the passage that he wishes to unlock.

However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the ghosts quickly.\n\nThere are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only last for a number of seconds.

According to the manual of the game, tapeworms live in bean patches, love to eat fruit and are preyed upon by other critters named Beeky the Bird, Spanky the Spider and Mystery Beetle. Uhhhh, right.\nOur hero here is Slinky, a tapeworm who's patrolling the local bean patch. In order for him to get to the fruit he loves, he has to slither around the screen eating up all the beans. He consumes them by touching a bean with his head (merely a yellow square), and by doing so, another bean appears somewhere else on the screen, and then you're off again. The more beans Slinky eats, the longer he grows. Which is a problem. As you steer the worm through the bean patch, you need to take great care not to coil him back over himself because, omnivore that he is, Slinky will eat himself.\n\nDon't tread too gingerly because while Slinky is hot after those beans, a beetle is moving across the bottom of the screen, outside the patch, bearing down on something you're supposed to believe is an apple (on later levels, different fruits take the apple's place.) Trust me when I say that it takes a great imagination to believe the block graphics resemble anything you'd find at a farmer's market. Anyway, if the beetle gets to the fruit before Slinky eats his bean, two more beans appear on the screen and Slinky has to eat them, too. Other predators include the Mystery Beetle, Beeky and Spanky. They bleep across the bean patch at random intervals. If they happen to touch Slinky's head, it's curtains for the worm.\n\nTaken as a whole, Tapeworm isn't too bad. It borrows elements from Atari's Surround and Rock-Ola's obscure Nibbler. But what where Tapeworm fails is in its presentation (i.e. - crap graphics) and unresponsive controls.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/a0wq5rnzi4zsauf6orfh.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":11149,"name":"The Challenge of Nexar","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A single screen crosshair shooter written by David Lubar.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ax9y5efiev3sypr3lkb1.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":24937,"name":"Nautilus","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A 1982 game by Synapse Software, the player controlled a submarine to destroy or rebuild an underwater city.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mlc0ulnnmc0ymfvfulh3.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"}]},{"id":22413,"name":"Infiltrate","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are a secret agent on a mission of crucial importance.

For example, there is Activision's Enduro: Race for Riches, Data Age's Bermuda Triangle Replica Artifact, and Parker Brothers' Super Cobra Flight Jacket. Not surprisingly, Imagic also held several contests, one of which is \"Defend Atlantis\".\n\nUnfortunately for Imagic, there were a lot of good Atlantis players. In fact, more than four individuals maxed out the score, so Imagic had to figure out a way to decide who the top four would be. They created a special contest version of Atlantis, that they called Atlantis II, that these top scorers would use for a tie-breaker.\n\nAtlantis II is basically the same as Atlantis, except that it's faster, harder, and lower scoring. Contestants were sent a letter telling them that they qualified for this shoot off. They were to recieve in the mail the Atlantis II cartridge, along with the snorkeling set and t-shirt.\n\nAccording to Imagic, \"We've designed this contest version of Atlantis just for you experts. Those tricky Gorgons will still thwart you at every turn, but now the battle will be more fierce and the points scored for direct hits will be less.\n\nAre you expert enough to meet this challenge and save Atlantis from the dreaded Gorgon death ray? If you're brave enough, read on.\" Contestants were to play the game for only two days and then send in their high scores.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5vji.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":40771,"name":"Space Canyon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Space Cavern is a 1982 shooter video game for the Atari 2600 developed and released by Games by Apollo.
