Use simple, two-button controls to pilot your rickety rocket and save endangered colonists over 25 levels of increasing intricacy and menace.\nThe child-like look masks a grown-up challenge; each collision risks losing a piece of your rocket, turning a mission of precision flight into a chaotic struggle to survive. Master the controls and learn to fly “smooth” – fast, close, and free of injury – to make your way up the leaderboards.\nLoose Nozzles is free to play to completion, and a one-time purchase unlocks: unlimited lives, restarting from any level, rocket upgrades, skins that look and fly differently, and alternate play modes for even greater challenge.\nLoose Nozzles is a labor of love from Foster and Family Games. We hope you like it!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co689v.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":219916,"name":"Lettermon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Meet lettermon! the monster-catching... word game?\nyou're familiar with word shuffle games, where you rearrange letters to make as many words as you can. enter lettermon - you'll have 26 cool new friends, each representing a letter from a-z. your lettermon will be an extra letter you can bring in to any word shuffle level, so you can make even more words!","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":219917,"name":"Laser Space","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"We like to spark new ways of thinking.
