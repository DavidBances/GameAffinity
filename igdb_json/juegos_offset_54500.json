Bands of survivors live on without ever knowing the warmth of sunlight, and whether or not they are the last ones left on Earth. The Moscow Metro is the reluctant home for this new humanity and one you protect at all costs.\n\nMetro Stations have become city-states run by new and emerging Factions, uniting its members around ideas, religions, water, or simply the need to survive. Your daily existence centers around gathering resources necessary for survival, repelling attacks of mutants, exploring and conquering new metro stations and developing armed mercenary units when the need arises. To survive, you'll have to build necessary facilities at Stations, establish diplomatic relations with your neighbors and uphold the economy of your little underground state.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5eko.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DaSuppa Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Windows Phone"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":59065,"name":"Yelaxot","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An open world adventure / puzzle indie game developed by Barkalar Games.

Hostile areas are populated by enemies who are visibly walking on screen.\n\nUnlike most Japanese RPGs, there are no separate \"battle screens\" in the game; the monsters are fought on the same spot they are encountered on, like in action games. However, unlike most action RPGs, there is a party in Ruin. The player controls only Jan, while the other party members act according to AI routines: attacking, casting offensive and healing spells, etc.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is traditional Japanese RPG style: acquiring better weapons and armor, automatic leveling up, linear story development, etc.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8nv1.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":59326,"name":"Ansatsu Kyoshitsu: Assassin Ikusei Keikaku!!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ansatsu Kyoshitsu: Assassin Ikusei Keikaku!! is the second game based on the Ansatsu Kyoshitsu (Assassination Classroom) manga and anime.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7n0f.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Three Rings Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":59327,"name":"Sugoro Chronicle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Compile Heart developed card based game released exclusively on the Wii in Japan","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mvny87hctpbhjpvhezve.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":59328,"name":"Musou Tourou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Nippon Ichi Software published strategy game released exclusively for the PlayStation Portable in Japan","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ysm.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":59329,"name":"Magatama","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Set in a medieval Japan, Magatama tells the story of a war between the forces of the Yamato and the Shogun Bakafu forces.

The game is similar to other robot/mech games by Masaya/NSC, such as Vixen 357 on Sega Mega Drive.At the end of the 24th century, humanity recovered from a devastative World War and humans started to colonize the galaxy. In 2384, unknown invaders attack the Jupiter base and finally reach Earth. Although the Earth Federation has prepared a counter offensive, the chances of success are very slim. But the Asian Federation has a secret weapon, the SERD Squadron, and its mission is to find and destroy the invader‚Äôs bases and drive them out of Earth. Hiso Kihei Serd is a turn based war game at its core and in any given mission the player must deploy and control a number of Serd giant robots on an overhead map ‚Äì each mech comes with its own characteristics, some are fast and have long-range attacks whereas others are bulkier, slower but use more powerful weaponry. When a fight between two opponents is triggered, the screen switches to an animated sequence. Each Serd gains experience in battle which may be used to enhance its attack and evasive capabilities. However, should one of the Serd be destroyed during a given mission, it is gone for good but more (up to seven) can be acquired as the game progresses. Hiso Kihei Serd consists of ten missions and is single player only. A password system also allows the player to save his progress (although the backup RAM can also be used).\n\nIt is important to remember that some units possess a special ability, many of which can easily turn the tide of the battle. Using them wisely is a key to quick victory in later stages. Overall, this is an enjoyable game, and a prequel to Vixen 357. One can easily notice the similarities between these 2 games, and it‚Äôs easy to pick up one if you‚Äôve ever played the other one at some point.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6xfj.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NCS","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":59350,"name":"Zero Pilot Zero","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The final PlayStation 2 release in the Zero Pilot series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jut6m04ci8xp70ik7f3r.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":59351,"name":"Victory Wings: Zero Pilot Series","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An entry in the Zero Pilot series published by Sammy Studios.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/klob3exxmqrd3y9zqc9m.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":59352,"name":"Zero Pilot: Fighter of Silver WIng","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The first game in the Zero Pilot flight simulation series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xiej3amudhxhzmrx3lwt.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":59353,"name":"iGP Manager","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"iGP Manager is a massively-multiplayer online motorsport manager game.
