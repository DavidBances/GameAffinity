The expansion comprises an assortment of otherworldly planes that do not exist in a planetary sense within the EverQuest universe. \n \nThe expansion added content to the game aimed specifically toward the high-end player. In addition to adding new zones to the game, the expansion also introduced a network of portal points through the game realm. Players could use them to quickly travel to and from various regions through a central plane, known as Plane of Knowledge. \n \nThe primary goal, or end-quest, of The Planes of Power is access to the Plane of Time. Access to this plane can only be obtained through vanquishing the four elemental deities or avatars of such: Fennin Ro, The Rathe Council, Coirnav and Xegony. To gain access to all of the zones of the expansion and successfully enter the Plane of Time, the players needed to complete 28 flag events of all sorts, involving the death of planar deities and deific creatures. These encounters can only be completed with the organized effort of up to 72 players working together simultaneously. \n \nIn order to enter the expansion's basic zones, a player had to reach the former set planar level of 46. From there, one had to complete tasks to gain access to the more advanced zones. It was later changed so that once the character reached level 55 they gained access to two more zones which are the Plane of Valor and the Plane of Storms. At 62 the Bastion of Thunder then became available. Those level limits can be bypassed by completing the progression of the expansion, allowing for example to be level 46 while adventuring in the Bastion of Thunder. The maximum level was increased from 60 to 65 with this expansion and new Particle Weapons were added, when before only epic weapons had such visual effects.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1h4s.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Online Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":79301,"name":"X-Man","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8oxd.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Universal Gamex","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":79302,"name":"Turtle Bay","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"After alien octopuses have taken over several bays in the Caribbean, Amazon and Antarctica, abducting and freezing Kroet's fellow sea creatures in the process, it is up to the player to stop their spread by propelling Kroet into the octopuses while they are pupating.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7m9f.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Astragon","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Phenomedia Publishing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Snowstep Development","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":79303,"name":"Knot in 3D","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9h6l.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":79304,"name":"EastEnders","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"EastEnders is an action game based on the BBC tv show also titled EastEnders.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co61kk.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Macsen Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":79305,"name":"QuestMania","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Questmania is the third game in Nadeo's \"Mania\" series of user-generated content-focused games, this time with an RPG slant!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/m485xkaleft4a7kdcexy.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":79306,"name":"Lovely x Cation 1 & 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Lovely x Cation 1&2 comes with both the 2011-launched Lovely x Cation and the 2013-launched Lovely x Cation 2.

Be warned: you can only carry one money bag at a time, and the weight of the bag makes you move slowly, making it a lot easier for miners to catch you. Also remember that time is against you, but if you manage to dump a bag in the wheelbarrow, you are given more time.

Levels are unlocked by completing previous levels, but can be replayed at any time afterwards. The game has no plot, and new concepts in-game are introduced through specific levels and not explicitly.\n\nLevels are made difficult through the usage and placement of obstacles - mostly spikes - which all kill the player immediately upon contact (and shred the creature into bones and gibs). Most obstacles are static, requiring only accuracy in movement and careful jumps, but several include interactive objects or moving platforms - or, in one of the few concessions to the player, checkpoints. Levels are not timed, and there is no scoring, but the game displays a continual tally of the player's deaths throughout the levels.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vzxbza4wmdewud0pafi4.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":79488,"name":"I Want It!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"I Want It! is an Xbox Live Indie Game featuring an unruly child and his mother.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kn3nsm1bzfnpyyck1mgv.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":79489,"name":"Taito Variety Pack","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A compilation of four classic Taito games for Game Boy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jpw3lncgho5kgc2avph9.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mani","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":79490,"name":"Snooker","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2sgq.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Visions Software Factory","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":79491,"name":"Press Your Luck","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based off of the 80s game show of the same name, Press Your Luck allows you to play as one of three contestants in both a quiz round, and a shot at the \"big board.\" Correct answers in the quiz round give spins for the board round.
