Just ask Dark Soulman.\n- Meat Boy and Bandage Girl can fight back. It’s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris.\n- Bigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this.\n- Brand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don’t sit too close though. (If your parents aren’t home you can sit as close as you want we won’t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.)\n- A soundtrack composed by Ridiculon so intense that the state of Wyoming has issued a ban on all audio devices capable of playing it out of fear that just a single note will cause the dormant super volcano beneath Yellowstone to erupt ushering in a new age of darkness.\n- Frame by frame artisan crafted in game animations, and animated cutscenes that will make you experience procedurally generated emotions.\n- A story so rich and moving that it makes Citizen Kane look like an unboxing video for a dehumidifier.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5qlr.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Thunderful","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team Meat","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":44004,"name":"Fatal Fury First Contact","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Those legendary wolves stake their claim on a new stage!
