It makes the game much more violent than before. There's much more blood, plus it adds unique gibs, death animations, dismemberments, headshots, executions, fire and explosion particles, flares, and much more.\n\nThe whole world becomes more real and interactive.You can kick severed limbs and heads (and sometimes, use it to activate some traps in the map earlier, or even kick them against enemies to do some damage), you can shoot enemies' heads to deal more damage (and cause more gruesome deaths) you can destroy most things in the the scenario (trees, lamps, hanging bodies, etc), you can paint the floor, the walls, and even the ceiling with blood, you can push the explosive barrels to make traps, or grab them and use like an explosive weapon, you can silently take down enemies from behind and perform stealth kills, the chainsaw actually cuts the enemies in two. When you find the berserk pack and get super strength, you can perform cinematic executions and RIP AND TEAR your foes with your bare hands. Some enemies will scream in anguish and try to crawl away when near death, and they can be used as human shields, and much, much more.\n\nEverything in Brutal Doom is extremely intense. Everything sounds louder, looks bigger, moves faster, and hits harder. You can even fell the impact of explosions. Enemies are harder and smarter, and weapons and explosions are much louder. Your weapons have been upgraded to a deadly arsenal, completely throwing the vanilla Doom's \"progressive weapon system\" through the window. Every weapon is powerful and have it's pros and cons, a a weapon will never be outclassed when you find a new weapon, but only find a different use for different situations, making Brutal Doom more balanced and more strategic than Vanilla gameplay. You have new abilities too. With any weapon selected, you can press Q (default bind) to kick enemies at close range and send them away. Every new feature and weapon is cautiously balanced, and added in a way that makes sense in the universe of Doom. Many of the features can also be disabled/enabled to provide the best personal experience possible.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4m90.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Marcos Abenante","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":93517,"name":"Mass Effect: Infiltrator","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mass Effect: Infiltrator is a third-person shooter developed by IronMonkey Studios for mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 and BlackBerry 10) set in the Mass Effect universe.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co31p0.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"IronMonkey Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"BlackBerry OS"},{"id":0,"name":"Windows Phone"}]},{"id":54393,"name":"Spooky Mall","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pack your stores with the items ghouls crave in Spooky Mall, a colorful endeavor to serve the undead.

The game was developed by Maurice Guégan of Stabyourself.net, who has previously worked on parody games such as Not Tetris. Mari0 was developed with the LÖVE framework, and is cross-platform. The game was released on March 3, 2012 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux under a Creative Commons license (BY-NC-SA). The source code is also available to download.\nThe core game of Mari0 plays directly from the 8-bit Super Mario Bros. 2D platform game, where the player controls Mario via the keyboard, running and jumping through levels, avoiding or jumping on enemies to defeat them, while collecting coins to earn points towards their score. The game adds the concept of the \"portal gun\" from the Portal series; the player can click with the mouse device on two separate surfaces on the level to create a portal between them. This can be used for a number of gameplay options, often using vertical momentum entering one portal to \"fling\" the Mario character horizontally out of the other portal, but will also affect enemies and other game elements in similar manners.\nThe core game uses the level designs from the original Super Mario Bros. as well as sets of test chambers inspired by Portal '​s Aperture Science, but a level editor, along with different graphic sets and shaders are provided to create new content. Up to four players can cooperatively play in the game. Online multiplayer is to be released in a future version.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co22jz.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Stabyourself.net","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":173810,"name":"Cryptic Caverns","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are stranded on an island after a terrible shipwreck in which you are the sole survivor.
