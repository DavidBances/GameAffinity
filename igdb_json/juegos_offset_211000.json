Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their stalves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.\n\nPower-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life).

Hanson and published by Mindscape for the Commodore 64. The game is based on the Indiana Jones series, and was released in North America around January 1985, while a U.K. version was released in March 1985.\n\nGameplay requires the player to think like fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones to solve the puzzles of each level, as the game does not provide the player with any rules or gameplay information; the game's cover advertised, \"Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you.\"\n\nIndiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom features six levels played across a \"Lost Kingdom.\" Playing as Indiana Jones, the player must solve a puzzle in each level to progress through the game. The player's ultimate goal is to retrieve a valuable artifact that contains the secrets of a lost civilization, before Jones' arch-rival, Ivar Reiss, can take it for himself. Indiana Jones is armed only with a mystical cane, and must battle against numerous enemies and perils throughout the game, including bats, monsters, steep cliffs, twisting mazes, and \"killer snowflakes\". Joystick movements vary between each level, requiring the player to relearn the control scheme throughout the game. A two-player option is also available.\n\nNo rules or gameplay information is provided to the player, who is left to use logic and intuition to solve each puzzle, as Indiana Jones would. Solving each puzzle requires the player to pay close attention to subtle changes in each level's surroundings or musical score, as well as other possibilities, testing the player's \"Indiana Jones Quotient\" (IJQ). However, the game's instruction manual does feature clues at the bottom of each page. Each clue is presented as a hieroglyphic, and must be deciphered by the player using a magic viewer, similar to 3D glasses. A \"clue hotline\" was also available for players, providing them with pre-recorded hints on how to finish each level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co97rh.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":25860,"name":"Felony!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An additional set of 12 cases to solve.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zdl7qgol4of7bo1mpogw.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":25841,"name":"Fred","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The game consists of 6 levels, on which you must obtain treasures and - of course - a map that allows you to leave the labyrinthine pyramid alive.\n\nYou must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8it3.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":25833,"name":"Private Eye","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You choose from five different cases to work, each with its own requirements.

Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land.\n\nNavigation\nIn navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode.\n\nTorpedo\nIf you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.\n\nSea-to-land\nIf you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see \"Dock for refueling\" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city.\n\nSea-to-air\nIf a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite. Use you joystick, or the trak-ball , if you plugged one into port 2, to aim at an incoming missile and press fire to blast it. If it gets past you but has not reached your city, you get a \"Refocusing\" message and the view switches to a short range view where you will get one more try.\n\nBe warned that ships can attack you no matter what mode you are in.

All four types are unmounted. It uses the simple \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" type of unit balance typical of the genre. Knights beat Barbarians in melee; Barbarians have the advantage over Archers; and Archers have the advantage over Knights, in addition to being effective at defending against attempts to storm a fort. Spies did not fight, but had twice the range of any other unit type in terms of lifting the fog of war.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player is able to select from a list of campaigns to play. The campaigns include both skirmishes and \"capture the flag(s)\" type missions, while the terrain layout and initial starting units provided a variety of strategic options for game play. Advanced rule sets such as Training New Units and Supply Line Lengths allow for more customization. The player can also select from among several Artificial Intelligence opponents represented by various historical figures such as Geronimo and Napoleon. Sun Tzu represents the most difficult level. These settings affected both AI behavior, as well as certain properties such as the speed at which enemy units moved through difficult terrain.\n\nThere is no element of the economic management (mining, gathering or construction) which is a common feature of later real-time strategy games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21ih.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":14588,"name":"Underwurlde","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Underwurlde is the second in the Sabreman series, following on from his adventures in Sabre Wulf.

We're all counting on you, sailor!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/t2sbwjrpz3j5z7rrn9fr.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13315,"name":"Amsgolf","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Amsgolf is a computer simulation game of an 18 hole golf course.

As the series begins, Dr. Moffet and his crew steal Airwolf during a live-fire weapons test. During the theft, Moffet opens fire on the Firm's bunker, killing a United States Senator and seriously injuring Firm deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (codename \"Archangel\"). Moffet takes the gunship to Libya, where he begins performing acts of aggression - such as sinking an American destroyer - as a service for military strongman Muammar Gaddafi, who allows Moffet to keep Airwolf on Libyan soil.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9ct4.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore 16"},{"id":0,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore Plus/4"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]}]
