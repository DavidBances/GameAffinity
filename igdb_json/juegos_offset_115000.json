It is a 2D air combat game played from a side view where the plane can fly in any direction using rotation as the screen scrolls along. Control of the plane is often based on short bursts of thrusts and it can only shoot in the direction it is facing with an unlimited number of bullets. The game consists of several levels that are won by achieving one of three win conditions, for instance killing a certain number of fighters, boats, general enemies or reaching a certain score. Combat encourages risks to build up combos. Health is represented through the border surrounding the game's screen. When it is black the plane is in good health, but when the plane is hit the border flashes, turns red and the colour then changes back to black gradually. When hit with a red border already present the plane blows up.\n\nBetween missions it is possible to unlock upgrades for the body, engine and weapons in the hangar. There are five upgrades for each type. Each combination of any upgrade leads to a new ship configuration but also to a remix of the game's soundtrack, so every tweak provides variety in the music as well. The mission objectives are also tailored to the chosen upgrades. There are 125 weapon combinations and 60 missions in total.\n\nThe game was made available both as a digital download and as a cartridge. The game is PAL only with compatibility for C64, C128 and C64GS. The music was composed for the more recent 8580 SID chip. The download version is optionally bundled with a pre-configured Linux, Mac and Windows version of the VICE emulator. The file can also be brought over to the real hardware using 1541 Ultimate II or Turbo Chameleon.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5mw7.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"RGCD.DEV Ltd","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Vlambeer","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":145256,"name":"The Assembly / Perfect Double Pack","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wql.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":91409,"name":"Ukrainian ball in search of gas","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You play as a man turned into a ball and you need to steal all the gas from the forest at all costs.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4snu.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nikita \"Ghost_RUS\"","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ghost_RUS Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":89846,"name":"Tokyo Xanadu eX+: Limited Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tokyo Xanadu eX+: Limited Edition includes:\n- New side stories, characters, modes, dungeons and quests.\n- 9-inch Deluxe White Shroud Figure - top-quality, hyper-detailed poly-resin sculpture of the mysterious White Shroud character, fully assembled and painted, with detachable display base.\n- 60-page Exclusive Art Collection - full-color book featuring over 300 of dazzling images of characters and settings plus important information on the world of Tokyo Xanadu.\n- Blade Card Game Deck - includes boxed set of 44 printed cards and 2-player rules, so you can take the Blade game into the real world.\n- CD Soundtrack - with 10 music tracks from the game, including the opening song \"Seize the Day\" (lyrics by Kyo Hifumi).\n- Collector's Box - everything immaculately packed, including a separate printed carton for the White Shroud figure.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1kd2.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":83773,"name":"tinyBuild Thrill-Seeker Bundle","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Woah is that tinyBuild's thrilling new bundle!??

Is a throw back to the Classics of RTS where you can build up your base and build up your massive army. Ranging from Ground units , Air Units and Sea Units. We also take you on a story base RTS where a faction has a meaning to the map or why its in-game. We are a balance focus on PvP, PvE and Story/Campaign. We don't want focus on the PvP Competitive or ESports side of things. Since i feel like RTS games are ment for Story and Campaign. We also understand that alot of players don't even want to PvP so they expect great PvE so we hope to have the right Balance between all those 3 core gameplays. We want make a RTS thats plays from the Classics but has the Graphics of New Gens for the players that haven't experienced the great RTS games we had in the pass.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":38802,"name":"Into the Ice: Nazis of Neuschwabenland","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"4 years in the making, finally coming to your PC: Into the Ice - Nazis of Neuschwabenland - the official sequel to the multiple GOTY and award winner \"Into the Dark\".
