So get off your date's corpse, put on some clothes, and get to work. But remember: achieving your dreams might cost more than you think.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67we.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":240242,"name":"Pixel Puzzles Ultimate Jigsaw","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pixel Puzzles Ultimate, The Number 1 Jigsaw Game On PC.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8rlh.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Pixel Puzzles","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":240243,"name":"FIFA 2001: Major League Soccer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"PlayStation port of FIFA 2001: Major League Soccer.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7yee.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EA Canada","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":240244,"name":"Gênio Quiz","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gênio Quiz is a free browser trivia game with 50 questions that challenges your brain, developed by André Birnfeld and released on his defunct website, lol.net.br.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67wl.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"André Birnfeld","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":240245,"name":"Genius Quiz","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Genius Quiz is an expanded version of the first game in the trivia series, now featuring 100 questions, a three-lives system, and a leaderboard.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67wo.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"André Birnfeld","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":240246,"name":"Genius Quiz 1","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Genius Quiz 1 is a port of the original Gênio Quiz for mobile devices, now translated into English.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67wq.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"André Birnfeld","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":240247,"name":"Angry Birds Kingdom","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Angry Birds Kingdom is an upcoming game advertised by Rovio Entertainment on Facebook.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67wr.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Rovio Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":240248,"name":"Angry Birds Double Crossed","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Angry Birds Double Crossed is an upcoming action-reality game show that was advertised starting on April 6, 2021, surprisingly only on Instagram.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co67ws.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Rovio Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":240249,"name":"Secret Spy: Operation Love","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As the world's top special agent, your job is to save your target and yourself from a deadly plot that could end your career—permanently.

Released in 2008, it was the first Lemmings game to mention the tribes at all since The Lemmings Chronicles in 1994.\nDespite being about the tribes, the game lacks any real story. Much like The Lemmings Chronicles, the game only features 3 tribes.\n\nClassic Tribe, featuring 14 levels.\nMedieval Tribe, featuring 13 levels.\nSpace Tribe, featuring 16 levels.\n\nAdditionally, there are 4 separate Tutorial levels that teach the player the 8 classic skills, including a playground level with infinite time and infinite skills to play around with.\n\nUnlike its predecessor Lemmings Return, the mechanics are significantly different from the J2ME version of Lemmings. The 8 classic skills, for example, all function a bit differently from how they do in either of the former 2 games. The level structure, however, is entirely identical to Lemmings. The number of lemmings in each level does not depend on how many the player saved in the previous level; each level simply has a save requirement the player must meet. The levels can have anywhere from 1 to 20 lemmings.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co680t.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Glu Mobile","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":240379,"name":"LemminGS","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"LemminGS is an unlicensed port of Lemmings for the Apple IIGS.\n\nThe graphics were pulled from the Atari ST version, the midi music from the PC version, and sound effects from the Macintosh version.

The player can launch another if a ball is destroyed or offscreen.\n\nThe levels contain obstacles and elements such as fans which block the way, sharp fans which destroy the ball, bubble jets which propel the ball in a specific direction, and others. Solving the level often involves carefully hitting switches to deactivate inconvenient obstacles. There are several different types of balls, in addition to the basic one: the metal ball is heavy and hard to control, but it can shatter glass barriers; the seltzer ball slowly dissolves in water and thus has a limited lifetime, but it can fit in tight spaces and avoid obstacles when shrunk, and it can be made to float upwards at any time. There is also a helicopter ball, which can move freely in any direction but cannot exit the level.\n\nThe game includes a built-in level editor and some unlockable bonus content.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6895.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Vertigo Gaming Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":240535,"name":"Ore no Ryomi 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ore no Ryomi 2: The Restaurant is a restaurant management game. Similarly to its predecessor, it's an action-strategy game where the player must manage his funds and personally prepare all the dishes for the customers.\n\nBefore the start of each day, the player can spend money to purchase expansions for his restaurant, including new food menu items and proper equipment. Once the day starts, the player must manage his time carefully to cater to all the customers and the restaurant's needs from morning till closing hours.\n\nThroughout the day, new customers keep coming in and ordering food, and events (such as the need to wash dishes or a fire in the kitchen) require the manager's attention. Each customer and event is represented by a gradually vanishing bar. Preparing food and caring for problems is usually done through a simple, action minigame. The player can only take on one of these at a time, but it is possible to serve prepared meals to customers in the middle of something else.\n\nEach customer expects his food to be prepared strictly according to order. If the player messes something up by adding the wrong ingredients or by under- or overcooking the food, the customer will pay less. And if a customer waits too long without their order being attended to, they get furious and leave, causing a minor monetary penalty. Things get even more hectic during the \"Rush Hour\" that comes twice daily, during which large crowds of customers keep coming in.\n\nOre no Ryomi 2 also contains several \"Challenges\": the player, invited to the Iron Chef TV show, tries to complete a specific difficult task, such as preparing many perfect dishes in a limited time.
