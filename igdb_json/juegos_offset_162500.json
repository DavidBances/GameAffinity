The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to Guitar Hero's Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.\n\nA single player career mode is available, as well both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes (\"DJ vs DJ\"), playable locally or remotely. Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with Guitar Hero and other compatible guitar controllers in a \"DJ vs Guitar\" mode. Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix. A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ri1.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Exient Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"FreeStyleGames","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":2480,"name":"Torchlight","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this ARPG you control a hero who explores a series of randomized dungeons, fightinghordes of enemies and collecting equipment, gold, and loot while doing so.

The game was officially released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine. The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game.\n\nIn Gears of War 2, the COG continues its fight against the Locust horde, who are attempting to sink all of the cities on the planet Sera. Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \"Horde\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \"chainsaw duels\" and the ability to use downed foes as \"meatshields\" were added to the game.\n\nOn its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies. It was the seventh best selling video game of 2009 and received several accolades. The game received similar praise as its predecessor, with the new gameplay and multiplayer modes seen as outstanding additions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5eyc.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Epic Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":29045,"name":"Art Style: Digidrive","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Digidrive (also known as Art Style: Intersect) is a puzzle game for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare service.

One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called \"one of its silver linings\". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010.\n\nBackbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade. A patch released on 6 August 2010, alleviated many of the issues critics had with the game upon release and included upgrades such as: improved AI, new play books and an enhanced replay feature.[1]","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4k6j.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"505 Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NaturalMotion","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":5255,"name":"Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The lands of Eldar have long been known as the origin of chaos, a place where monsters and demons wreak havoc, indiscriminate in their madness.

The game is divided in three main sections. The first is a hidden object challenge with a time limit, where the player has to search for objects on rooms from the house, to sell them later. Instead of the usual list at the side of the screen with names of required items, the game shows slots to store a general type of object, and the player has to click on things that correspond to the category or theme (for example, \"Babies and Kids\" for toys, \"Yard and Garden\" for gardening tools, and so on). Some objects need an extra item to make them work, like power chords and batteries, before they can be collected. Next comes the yard sale, shown in a isometric view, with all the items set on tables and the customers roaming around them. A list at the left side shows clues to what every patron wants (\"woman in red wants to cart some rocks\"). The player has to drag and drop the customers to their items. The final component is the decoration screen, where the money accumulated on the yard sale is spent on curtains, floor covers, furniture and other things. Clues appear that indicate the necessary items to improve the final rating, that goes up to 5 stars.
