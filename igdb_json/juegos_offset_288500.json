The gameplay builds on the classic formula of controlling a paddle near the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball and remove bricks from the field, but it adds some new elements. There are two types of paddles and they are divided into three parts. When the ball hits one of the paddle's three sections, it becomes warmer and when it is hot, bullets are shot automatically, destroying the bricks above. Particles have physics and will collide with the paddle or the walls. The player is rewarded for clearing columns and that increases the speed of the ball.\n\nThe game can be played in an endless mode or in a set of procedurally generated levels where the difficulty level is gradually increased. Destroyed bricks often leave behind power-ups such as additional balls or explosions. Diamonds can be collected as a currency to upgrade the paddle multiple times, improving the fire power.

The postcards and packages have vowel sounds and words. At the Powerstation kids put letters together to sound-out words. This is a great phonics activity. Kids hear all the letters sounded out as they form words.
