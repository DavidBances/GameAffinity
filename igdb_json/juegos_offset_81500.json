Exploration in open-world style with the strenght of enemies and players limiting the movement to only same-or-lower level fights.\n\nCharacters can craft various gear to help in their quest, and this is also the main way to gain power.

Pokémon Mezastar was officially announced in the May 2020 issue of CoroCoro released on April 15, with more details revealed in a press release on August 12. It was intended to be launched in Japan during summer 2020, but was delayed until September 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe game incorporates similar features to the developer's previous titles and continues the use of physical peripherals, in this case tags, to operate Pokémon in battles. These battles are conducted with three Pokémon on each side and take place in a variety of environments. Players can capture Pokémon while playing the game, which are dispensed as tags from the machine.\n\nEach Pokémon Mezastar machine consists of two adjacent stations that share a large monitor. This monitor displays the user interface for individual stations, simulating the borders of the display with on-screen graphics while single-player games are in operation. Players can also partake in cooperative battles, during which the interface is expanded to cover both stations. This was previously featured in the arcade title Pokémon: Battle Nine, despite being promoted as a first for a Pokémon arcade machine.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6n08.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Marvelous Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Takara Tomy Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":238053,"name":"Fairy Tail: Additional Dungeon - Rift in Time and Space","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":222173,"name":"G-Mode Archives 16: Beach Volleyball Girl Shizuku 2: Hishou-hen","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Beach fairies fly to the world!\nTake the victory against the world's powerhouses!\n\nThe second easy-to-use beach volleyball game in which a cheerful high school girl, Shizuku Asagiri, is active.\n\nOne year after the previous work, the \"Cinderella Cup\" that determines the No.1 in the country...\nShizuku and his partner Haruna will go on a world expedition and challenge powerful players from various countries.\nLet's win a hot rally that unfolds with famous places around the world in the background and seize the victory!\n\nIn addition to unique characters and gorgeous swimsuits, this work introduces a \"tanning system\"!\nDepending on the swimsuit you are wearing, you will leave healthy sunburn marks on the water.\nYou can enjoy the combination of swimsuit collection and sunburn marks.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co79tg.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"G-MODE Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mobile & Game Studio, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":209096,"name":"Touhou Spell Bubble: Gensokyo Holoism Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gensokyo Holoism Pack includes all the popular \"Gensokyo Holoism\" arrangements.\nThe challenges in this release contain special mini-stories!\nAll the mini stories are Shichijo Lettuce (IOSYS) originals,\nbased off \"Touhou Spell Bubble\" and \"Gensokyo Holoism.\"","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4yyr.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":184288,"name":"Half-Life 2: Deeper Down","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In 2013’s Half Life 2 mod Deep Down, Jim Partridge took several key aspects from Episode Two, Alyx and the car, and expanded on these in an attempt to re-create that amazing Half-Life 2 feeling that everyone is looking for.

Godron wants to gain power over the whole land and transform the world according to his will. But there are the brave heroes Bernard and Celestine with their friend 2weistein who want to put a stop to Godron to keep Trillion peaceful and beautiful, and no on is ever to be afraid again!
