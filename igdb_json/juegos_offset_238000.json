The funds generated from the sales of \"Muffins on Stream\" will be used to further develop the game, improve its graphics and gameplay, and add new features and content. Additionally, the success of \"Muffins on Stream\" on Steam will help demonstrate the potential popularity of \"Muffin Tour Legacy\" and attract additional funding to bring the full game to fruition.\n\nMore about the game we want to make: In Muffin Tour Legacy, players take on the role of Molly, a skilled baker who owns the popular \"Muffin Legacy\" shop in the fantasy world of Flourden. Known for her exceptional muffin-making skills, Molly's world is turned upside down when a mysterious old man appears in her shop and offers her a rare ingredient called \"bake dust\" that can make her baking taste out of this world, but with the wrong usage, it can cause great evil.\n\nAs Molly embarks on a quest to save the universe from the Evil Bearclaw King and his pastry army, players will have to navigate the dangerous world of Flourden, uncovering clues and secrets about the \"baker dust\" and its potential to unleash great power and evil. Along the way, players will encounter various colorful characters and challenging obstacles as they strive to become the ultimate muffin-making hero. With fast-paced gameplay, an engaging story, and a unique fantasy setting, Muffin Tour Legacy offers players an unforgettable gaming experience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co66vc.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":239303,"name":"Box Office Boss","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Box Office Boss puts you in charge of your own movie studio.
