Eight playable characters stories intertwine when three characters enter Final Layer and two vanish without a trace. One returns back from Final Layer but claims to not remember what happened. Who do you trust? Who is telling the truth and who is lying? Who is friend and who is foe? \n \nKey Features: \nStrategic turn based combat involving balance. \nBattles happen on the same field as movement, no switching screens when combat starts. \nAffliction and buff system, for example, players cannot run away if they have stuck affliction. \nDouble and triple Jin techs allow party members to combine attacks with each other to form stronger attacks. \nTraps can be set in combat for strategic purposes such as delaying an attack for later. \n \nJin Conception is NOT like Among Us. Jin Conception is a single player game where you have to figure out who is friend and who is foe.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2tvw.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jin Wave Studio LLC","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":116020,"name":"Retro Machina","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Retro Machina is a single-player action game and exploration with elements of RPG, set in a retro-futuristic universe.
