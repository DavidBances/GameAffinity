Once the fourth largest lake in the world, the Aral Sea is now an arid wasteland, a victim of decades of Soviet cotton irrigation. To some, it is the prime example for humanity to stay out of nature's business. To others, it's a world waiting to be saved.\nReal-world setting: The vanished Aral Sea in Central Asia, peppered with artifacts of an all too real history.\nA world imagined: Eerily detailed, vibrant HD art, closely based on photos from the Aral Sea and filled with secrets.\nSomething to say: Experience a non-violent, thought-provoking, fully voiced story concerning the cost of saving worlds, without giving up control.\nExploration: Explore an interconnected game world using three characters with very different abilities.\nVariety, variety, variety: From climbing to exploring to diving to navigating pitch-black corridors, integrating new gameplay elements at every turn.\nCaptivating Soundtrack: With many vocal tracks and an ethnic vibe, composed and produced by Joel Bille\nFrom every disaster, new heroes emerge. This is the story of a suicide mission, an impossible attempt at restoring the Aral Sea. In the late 90's, a disgraced Russian oil tycoon found an underground secret that could save the dry basin. The sea would not be changed. But for the team assembled to work the miracle, life would never be the same again. Ten years later, the survivors' paths begin to converge. Something is pulling them back to the Aral Sea.\nSee every side of the story\nResidue has a story itching to be told. We have done it in the way that only video games can – by putting you in the middle of the action at all times. Resisting the temptation of a clear-cut protagonist, Residue carefully juggles you to let you see every side of the story, alternating between three characters with very different abilities - each one able to reach places the others can't - and very different ambitions. At times they help each other, at times they are in opposition. Sometimes both. Nobody said things weren't complicated.\nDid we mention Residue is crazy about the little details? While the main story may take you between two to three hours to complete, you can search for hours for all the little hints and references to real world events, as well as dozens of hidden collectibles and all-round secret content.\nAlways in control\nAs seen in our previous, much smaller game They Breathe, The Working Parts are devoted to telling stories in new ways while keeping interactivity at the forefront. That's why Residue isn't a point-and-click, but rather a visceral platform adventure where you're always in control, whether you're monkeying around the ship graveyard or diving through underground tunnels, navigating old Jumagul through dark corridors with a flickering flashlight, or ascending the side of the gigantic stranded drillship with Nikolai's makeshift grappling hook. Around every corner, Residue will show you something new.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2014,"developer":"The Working Parts","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC"}]},{"id":11174,"name":"Invisigun Heroes","genre":"Action","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f00f49ba599bf7e8b3c09e6bebfe572.jpg","description":"Invisigun Heroes is a multiplayer, single-screen stealth battle arena with a twist: everyone’s invisible!

A spin-off of the Final Fantasy series, the game shares several traits with 1997's Final Fantasy Tactics, although it is not a direct sequel. The player assembles a clan of characters, and controls their actions over grid-like battlefields. Players are mostly free to decide the classes, abilities, and statistics of their characters.\nThe game's story centers on four children; Marche, Mewt, Ritz, and Doned, who live in a small town named St. Ivalice. The children are transported to a realm of the same name as their town, \"Ivalice\", after discovering an ancient magical book. The story then focuses on the exploits of Marche as he attempts to return to the real world while facing opposition from those around him.\nTactics Advance is one of the initial products from the cooperation of Square and Nintendo made for the Game Boy Advance console; it was developed by the team brought over from the game company Quest Corporation. Following its release, Tactics Advance-themed merchandise was introduced. The game was positively received. It has a sequel, Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift for the Nintendo DS.\nTactics Advance was re-released for the Nintendo Wii U Virtual Console on January 28, 2016 for Europe, Australia and North America with Japan on March 30, 2016.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2003,"developer":"Square Enix","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":50572,"name":"Fade to Silence","genre":"RPG","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6eb/6eb391c7209b82eda963e6ba6eac69ce.jpg","description":"As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive.\nIn order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons.\n“You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today.\nThe wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?”\nFade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming.\n“You’re out hunting. The barren, snow-filled landscape is endless and unrelenting. A Ripper comes out of nowhere, and you fight it off, narrowly dodging its gigantic claws.\nThen you see it: a distant fire. Another person? Impossible. But there’s a strange noise—a voice?  Wild hope sears your heart; you won’t be alone anymore. The voice in your head steps in, discouraging you from investigating. “Anyone living must have done terrible things to survive”, it says. You quiet the voice, defying it this time, and move in closer. Another person could help you rebuild, gather food, harvest deer. You see someone—yes! Someone else is out here. Then, you hear a scream. But you hesitate. How can you trust them? Another scream, desperate. There’s only one way to find out.”Features:Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8km² area.\nWolf Sled Expeditions: Pack your sled, take a follower with you and engage in long term expeditions into the farthest regions.\nFight System: Tiered weapon system, melee and ranged combat.\nMoral choices: Save and recruit various NPCs to join your group. Harsh choices have to be made; who do you take, who do you leave behind.\nBattle increasingly dangerous Eldritch creatures that roam an apocalyptic world.\nTrust your inner voice. It is your friend.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2019,"developer":"THQ Nordic","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":47480,"name":"Granado Espada For SEA","genre":"RPG","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b43/b43f17b48f0147ed6c89c402fe53449f.jpg","description":"Founder's Server Open on October 25, 2017!\nPre-download from October 16, 2017!\nFounder's Server Open on October 25, 2017!\nOpen to all (F2P Transition) on November 1, 2017!\nAbout the GameCharacteristics\nMore than 170 game characters\nActive automatic hunting mode for gameplay support\nControl up to 3 characters simultaneously\nMore than 300 extensive areas to explore\nUp to more than 3,000 different quests\nOver 3,000 types of weapons, armor and costumes\nMore than 190 different missions, with over 7,000 types of regular monsters and over 100 types of raid monsters\nReal-time faction wars with Clique Battles, Colony Wars and other PvP and RvR contents\nElegant, medieval Europe-inspired graphics\nMore than 200 alluring background tracks","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":-1,"developer":"IMCGAMES Co.,Ltd.","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC"}]},{"id":45560,"name":"XXZ","genre":"Casual","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef9/ef9c5bf46b5ea652143ddea4a44d7743.jpg","description":"Zombie Apocalypses turned out to be somewhat different from what science fiction authors used to write.

All of this leads to the implementation of the Divine Education Act.\nNow, a year has passed and numerous goddesses and humans have had the chance to learn about each other, get to know one another, and come to a mutual understanding.\nIn Akihabara, the very heart of the Divine Idol culture and home to various subcultures, seven lucky goddesses dominate as the idol group L☆SEVEN.\nNext-Generation Goddess Auditions!\nDivine Idols, spread your wings and take flight!\nA glamorous contest, containing everything that goddess’ dreams are made of, is being held!\nLaugh, grow, and even cry together with goddesses who descended from the sky and are aiming to become top-level idols.\nThe younger sister of Bishamonten, who is a member of the top idol group comprised of the seven lucky goddesses, L☆SEVEN.\nShuri has always looked up to her older sister, performing on the streets with the aim to become an idol as well.\nBubbly and while seemingly full of confidence, there are times when she ends up comparing herself to her more-successful sister and doesn’t give herself enough credit. She’s down-to-earth and usually hardworking, but can quickly lose interest in things and isn’t afraid to show it.\nKisshouten represents prosperity and good luck, along with happiness, beauty, and wealth. She is worshipped in hopes of gaining respect and sometimes in the hope for bountiful harvests.\nAme no Uzume is a deity found originally in Shinto mythology. She appears in some of the oldest legends, such as the tale of the missing sun deity, when Amaterasu Omikami hid herself away at Amano-Iwato. She's said to be Japan's oldest performance artist.\nShe works part-time in a Divine Idol-themed cafe while building up her career from the grassroots level.\nKagura likes to have fun, but that doesn't mean she's a slacker. Her unique sense of rhythm and expressionism when she dances are both hers alone; no one else can duplicate them.\nIn true ‘Ame no Uzume’ spirit, she usually ends up giving the audience a little more of a risque performance as she easily gets worked up. But there are also times when she relaxes and can stay calm. Her personality is carefree and playful, which easily comes across in how she interacts with others.\nAs one of the more naturally seductive goddesses, she is not opposed to wearing more revealing costumes when she performs.\nBenzaiten's blessings are plentiful; she is the goddess of music, good fortune, the arts, victory, and even water. She holds the center position in L☆SEVEN.\nShe loves singing, but since she hasn't fallen in love yet, and with the abundance of love songs in the idol music genre, she often becomes doubtful of her ability to sing love songs convincingly.\nShe tends to play acoustic guitar when singing casually.\nEven though she's always at the center, at heart she's just a regular girl.\nShe can always be found smiling, which matches her cheerful personality.\nHer manner of speaking is calm and collected, but she sometimes lets her playful side show during conversations.\nJapanese Animated Novel / Visual Novel HD\nThree character routes to play through\nFully Voiced characters (only the protagonist isn't voiced)\nAnimated Sprites","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2016,"developer":"MoeNovel","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC"}]}]
