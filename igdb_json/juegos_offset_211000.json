It contains 120 stars and requires Mario to collect every last star before he can enter the final stage, Bowser in the Sky. As the name suggests, this hack is intended to be a much more difficult version of the game. This hack does not alter the level geometry of any of the stages, but instead adds difficulty by moving, adding, and replacing the objects within the stages. In general, this hack was not designed with glitches in mind, so many stars can be collected easily with trivial glitches or skips.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5tp8.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"OmegaEdge29","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 64"}]},{"id":227729,"name":"The Game of Life 2: Under the Sea","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Swim through a new life adventure in Under the Sea world!

From there you can select it like any other building or add it to your Hotbar. Blueprints have some unique build modes of their own, one focused on detailed control and the other on snapping with other Blueprints.\n\nCreature Game Modes\nPassive and Retaliating\nThese are the two new modes we added for Creature hostility which allow you to adjust how to interact with the combat aspect of Satisfactory. If you do want to fight, but want more control over the when and how, the Retaliating mode is for you. Creatures will only attack you if you attack them first, and this works per single creature. So, if you want to fight a group of Hogs or other creatures one after the other, you can do that now.\n\nPassive mode is exactly what it says: All creatures will remain passive, no matter if you attack them or not. If you want to enjoy Satisfactory without the action aspects, Passive mode gets the job done.\n\nYou can set your preferred Creature hostility in the Escape Menu under ‘Advanced Gameplay Settings’.\n\nIn the future\nThis is mostly what we have in mind for allowing you to customise your experience with Creatures. In the future we are planning to implement more game modes that allow you to adjust how you play Satisfactory.

Obviously not a WAD for everyone, the core target for such a mod is mainly people who are in video game glitches, corruptions and to some extent, creepypastas (whether that love is ironic or not). Nothing works as it is supposed to. You can hardly understand most of the things that are happening to you. Some of the custom monsters (like the hitscanning corrupted pinky) will put you on edge and keep you paranoid about the ruleset of the game.\n\nThe aesthetic of lilith.pk3 is one of a kind, horribly mangling the rendering engine of old ZDoom beyond belief to disform sprites, textures, text and even sound effects. The end result makes close to no sense, your Doom marine sprite is heavily dislocated and looks more like one of those creatures from Alien than a human being and the list goes on and on. The confused looks obviously doesn't always make for clean or concise gameplay, especially in later levels which crank the confusion up to eleven and manipulate the level geometry to do things you thought weren't possible in the game. Even basic things like crushers, slime pits or a turnstile look horribly out of shape and makes the player uncomfortable.\n\nThis is essentially what lilith boils down to: an unfamilarity to something we thought we knew by heart, a rising sense of uncomfort as the level design makes less and less sense and offering the player a new perspective on what Doom is. Don't play lilith expecting top-notch Doom gameplay, but play it for the one of a kind experience it offers you. For the better and for the worse, there are no WADs like lilith anywhere and there will never be.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5twu.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"anotak","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":227769,"name":"Divinity Fatum","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The protagonist wakes up in a cold rainy city not remembering anything.
