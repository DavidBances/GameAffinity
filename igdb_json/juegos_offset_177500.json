The cards from the previous two Power of Chaos games, if installed, are included. New game features include a ranked difficulty for the computer opponent, denoted by a star gauge in the Duel menu, which ranks from 1 star to 9. As you win duels, the difficulty increases, and the opponent swaps his Deck for a more potent one every time this happens. Later difficulty levels (8-9) allow the opponent to use different Decks in that same level. Losing consecutive duels results in decreased difficulty for the first time in Power of Chaos games. Other options include allowing the opponent to use cards from the previous two games, increasing the difficulty. Also, the option to make many Limited cards Forbidden is given, making the game more balanced. One other new addition to the game is that when you win cards that you already have, you may have a choice of getting different cards, or keep the ones you've earned.

Similarly to its predecessor, it's an action-strategy game where the player must manage his funds and personally prepare all the dishes for the customers.\n\nBefore the start of each day, the player can spend money to purchase expansions for his restaurant, including new food menu items and proper equipment. Once the day starts, the player must manage his time carefully to cater to all the customers and the restaurant's needs from morning till closing hours.\n\nThroughout the day, new customers keep coming in and ordering food, and events (such as the need to wash dishes or a fire in the kitchen) require the manager's attention. Each customer and event is represented by a gradually vanishing bar. Preparing food and caring for problems is usually done through a simple, action minigame. The player can only take on one of these at a time, but it is possible to serve prepared meals to customers in the middle of something else.\n\nEach customer expects his food to be prepared strictly according to order. If the player messes something up by adding the wrong ingredients or by under- or overcooking the food, the customer will pay less. And if a customer waits too long without their order being attended to, they get furious and leave, causing a minor monetary penalty. Things get even more hectic during the \"Rush Hour\" that comes twice daily, during which large crowds of customers keep coming in.\n\nOre no Ryomi 2 also contains several \"Challenges\": the player, invited to the Iron Chef TV show, tries to complete a specific difficult task, such as preparing many perfect dishes in a limited time. Throughout the game, the player receives trophies and awards, which he can proudly view in his Trophy Room if he has purchased them.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6896.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Vertigo Gaming Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":121365,"name":"Astro Boy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An action sandbox game by Sonic Team with emphasis on aerial combat and vertical movement.
