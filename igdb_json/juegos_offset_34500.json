This new update, coming to players for free on September 18, is a landmark moment for the game – not just offering a swathe of new content for the game’s most dedicated players and newcomers alike, but marking a new era in State of Decay 2’s development through the work of Wushu Studios.\n\nWushu, from Liverpool, England, will continue providing support to State of Decay 2 as much of original studio Undead Labs transitions to work on the next entry in the series – but where you might expect that support to be incremental, Wushu is making a very big splash. Curveball is a major update, touching almost every element of the game, and designed to consistently offer brand new challenges, even to those who have been playing State of Decay 2 since release.\n\nAvailable after the fifth in-game day, curveballs can change the world around your settlement in some very interesting ways. Housed in a new menu, curveballs will periodically appear – each with their own narrative attached – offering new objectives, rewards, enemy types and much more. Curveballs can be positive (like finding increased loot) or negative (like buffing regular zombies in multiple ways); they can be timed or objective based; they can affect enemies, your survivors, or other NPCs. Effectively, any element of the game you may have gotten comfortable with can, and often will, change.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7369.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Undead Labs","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Wushu Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":266117,"name":"Fortress Defense","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"'Fortress Defense' is a cartoon style defense game.

The goal is to terminate Crocomire in the Dissolvery, which is locked behind 4 Security Locks, (Similar to Fusion) however one unique thing that this ROM hack does it that you have a great choice of which order you want to do things in. You could get Space Jump before even touching the Varia Suit, get the Plasma Beam as your second beam upgrade, everything is possible if you’re clever enough.\n\nThe major items also move around during a “CORE-X” playthrough, (This game’s equivalent to Hard Mode) granting even greater replay value, especially to get those nice ending pictures. And yes indeed, the player sprites have been changed to those of the SA-X from Fusion, making the hack the second one to ever have custom Samus graphics in Zero Mission. The length of the hack is pretty short, (Around 2 hours) but going through all the endings and exploring the different paths of every difficulty could more than quadruple that. A full map is included with the download, with two different styles (And two different ones to reflect the changes in Hard Mode)\n\nThere are also other various ASM tweaks thanks to the talented ASM hackers of Metroid Construction, such as the Crocomire final boss being very close to Super Metroid’s, and the Fusion beams being ported back into Zero Mission.\n\nSo if you are looking for a refreshing Zero Mission hack with a Super Metroid vibe, this hack is for you!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co93hr.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Metroid Construction","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":270732,"name":"Deltarune: Rouxls Kaard","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Witness the Duke of Puzzles, the Crafty Box-Maker, the...
