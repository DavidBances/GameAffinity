The journey, in which Akka, the leader of the wild geese, has to be freed, leads through eight different locations, from the farm to the forest and river to Kullaberg, before finally ending up at the treasure chest. Naughty Nils always annoys all the animals and he certainly doesn't listen to his parents. One day, however, he has a bad time when an elf enchants the boy into his own kind. As such, Nils flees into the straw pile and from there continues on the back of the pet goose Martin.\n\nNow begins an exciting and, due to the adversities of nature, dangerous journey. Again and again, the players have to defend themselves against foxes, sometimes with cunning, sometimes with force, by asking the ram to drive the fox away with his horns.
