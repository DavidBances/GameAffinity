Inspired by the novel \"The island of Doctor Moreau\" by HG Wells. \n \nThe English expedition \"Peary & Scott\" discovers an island populated by strange and ferocious creatures. Half-human, half-animal, they were created by the famous Dr. Moreau. Peary, a scientist and biologist, resumes his work. \n \nAt a time when the abolition of slavery continues to grow worldwide, Scott, a wealthy industrialist and close to the royal family, sees huge potential in those \"beasts\": Cheap, hardworking manpower, easily renewable, and gifted with remarkable physical abilities. \n \nIn just 20 years, in secret, Peary and Scott will create hundreds of these \"beasts\" and build an empire. Inevitably, however, humans will lose control of the island: The north is occupied by humans, trapped and hidden behind their wall; while the rest of the island is populated by various generations of \"beasts\", which are often hostile towards each other. Most degenerate very quickly, and fall in bestial madness. \n \nThis is where your story begins: you are one of those \"beasts\". Your task will be long and difficult: Explore, develop, understand and reclaim the island, while respecting the law of Moreau. \n \nWill you keep your faith in humanity until the end of this journey ?","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1kb2.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"The Box Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Frog Factory","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":104621,"name":"One Word by Powgi","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The word search puzzle with a difference - there's only one word to find!

Their ravenous appetite “devour” and remarkable adaptability earn them first dread, then awe, and finally the name “Aragami”. In the face of an enemy completely immune to conventional weapons, urban civilization collapses, and each day humanity is driven further and further toward extinction.\n\nOne single ray of hope remains for humanity. Following the development of “God Arcs”—living weapons which incorporate Oracle cells—their wielders, the “God Eaters,” appear. In a world ravaged by mad gods, these “God Eaters” fight a desperate war...\n\nCreate your character, and fight for the survival of human-kind in GOD EATER 3. Select your weapon from a wide range of God Arcs and face brand new Aragamis in dynamic high-speed battles. Explore devastated areas you have never seen in the previous GOD EATER games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1hg9.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Marvelous First Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":22917,"name":"Gris","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gris is a 2D platformer developed by Nomada Studio and published by Devolver Digital.
