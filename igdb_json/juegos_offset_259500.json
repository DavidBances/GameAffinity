After many wars and natural disasters the location of The Guardian eventually slipped from people's memories and was lost forever from maps. Only legends remain telling of the trial and the strange machines that seem to crackle with the power of the skies.\n\nFor years you have dreamt of finding the Vault and gaining the treasure of the ancients but the mountain paths have just led you round in circles. One day, while searching the northwest mountain peaks, you discovered a hidden trail marked with small piles of stones covered in unusual symbols. Something looks familiar and you suspect you have seen these symbols before in ancient books, but your memory is fading and you are not sure anymore.\n\nAfter days of walking past countless marker stones, the trail eventually descended from the higher peaks towards a misty valley. Far off in the distance you could see a small hill with what seemed to be a man made structure on the top but you will need to get closer to find out.\n\nThe trail leads down into a dense forest shrouded in a thick miasma that chills you to the bone. The boughs creak and groan but there is no wind, just the fog blocking out the light above. Several days pass and eventually the winding trail leads upwards again, out of the mist.

Players will face many dangers in their travels, including horrible beasts like the Maple Goose or the Surly Caveman.\n\nBut the residents of this world are here to help, even if they sometimes need bribing or assistance themselves. If players can decipher the engaging puzzles, like which sandwich a guard might prefer as a random example, a world of possibilities will be revealed!\n\nThe game features 95 locations to explore, a plethora of enemies to battle, and a user interface developed specifically for the Rainbow 100 computer. Running in the Rainbow's rarely (possibly never?) used 66 column mode, the game caters to one of the most memorable personal computers of the 1980s that nobody actually uses anymore for anything. Developed entirely on an actual Rainbow 100, this game reflects dedication to a never-really-popular platform!
