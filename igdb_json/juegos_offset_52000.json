It seemed like a good idea at first - nice house, low price, fully furnished, quiet neighborhood… but when she comes across a locked room on the second floor, she starts to realize there's more to the house than what she was told. Why is that room locked? Why did the previous tenant leave the house so suddenly, leaving his things behind?

The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan.\n\nSamurai Spirits - Kenkaku Shinan Pack is a compilation only released in Japan that includes the first two Samurai Spirits games.\n\nSAMURAI SPIRITS:\nSamurai Shodown, known as Samurai Spirits in Japan, is a 1993 competitive fighting game produced by SNK for their Neo Geo arcade and home platform. In contrast to other fighting games at the time which were set in modern times and focused primarily on hand-to-hand combat, Samurai Shodown is set in feudal-era Japan (similar to Kaneko's Shogun Warriors) and was one of the first fighting games to focus primarily on weapon-based combat after the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II.\n\nWhen SNK released the game for the home console version of the Neo Geo system, the AES, the fans bought it up in droves, and it still stands as the most successful run of home Neo cartridges ever produced. The game was ported to multiple other platforms, including the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive, Sega Game Gear, Sega CD, Sega Saturn, 3DO, FM Towns, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.\n\nSTORY:\nIn early Japan, a man named Shiro Tokisada Amakusa preaches a heretic religion. Little does anyone know that Amakusa is really a servant of the evil Ambrosia, who took over Amakusa's body. Ambrosia wishes to shroud the world in darkness.

The game was a massive hit in Europe (except in Germany, where it was worse received due to some similarities with managers produced by local software houses such as Software 2000 and Ascaron), although it gained little support in Japan. \n \nThe series was noted for its micromanagement, where the player had to do the job of the team manager and much of that of the chairman, from player training up to bank balance management. Other well-known features were to bung an opposing team for preferential market treatment, rig or betting on the outcome of the players' team matches. Interviews after the match where some answers were printed with different interpretations on the next days' newspaper (the player could reply a question about the game with \"It was a game of two halves\", and \"He amazed us after the game by giving us an insight into the rules of football\" would be printed on the newspapers). \n \nIn all three games, the game always kept the same visual style: the main screen is a bird's eye view of the stadium facility (where clicking on the grass brings the squad selection screen or in the stands for the stadium builder) and all screens are presented like the player was inside an office (TCM 2004 used a similar interface option). To increase the feeling of \"being there\", tables are accessed via teletext, news from a newspaper and fixtures are available by clicking on a sheet attached to a clipboard. \n \nWhile improving with each game, most features were the same from the start of the series. The game compared favourably in all areas but AI against its leading competitor, Championship Manager.

It is similar to the PC and console versions of the same name and by the same developer. Those versions are not identical and described as an \"upmake\" of the NES version. The game borrows elements from Windjammers, which served as an inspiration.\n\nPlayers select one of six characters from a cast with names such as Rad Carlton, Bruiser Bogardus, Hot Foot Francis, Sparerib Boneapart, Mayo Monsoon or Ollie Oilsack. There are also multiple environments and different game modes. The characters are described as lumberjacks. Matches take place on a fixed screen view shown from an elevated position. Characters are standing on rolling logs and throw an axe that acts like a ball.\n\nIn a typical tournament different opponents need to be defeated one after the other. Points are scored by throwing the axe into the goal area behind the opponent. This zone is different for each environment. Sometimes there is only a single, large goal area, while another environment has three zones for five, two and five points respectively. In some levels like North Pool the middle part is entirely open, while in others like Mount Olympus the axe can only be thrown through a few open passages.\n\nThe opponent guards these areas and attempts to catch or bounce back the axe to try the same on the other side. A set is won when someone reaches twelve points. The best of three sets wins a match. Special items appear during matches such as stars (use a signature throw different for each character), magnets (increase catching range for five seconds), ice cubes (decrease the opponent's movement speed for a short amount of time) and oil (the axe cannot be caught for five seconds and will bounce back instead, and at a reduced speed). There are counters for some power-ups. For instance, when the signature throw is caught by the opponent, their signature throw becomes active right away.\n\nThe game supports competitive multiplayer against another opponent on the same screen. The game comes in a box with a green cartridge and a full colour manual.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3j6y.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mega Cat Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Plug In Digital","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":56696,"name":"Wolfpack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wolfpack is a co-op U-boat simulation game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3nc5.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":56697,"name":"Coffee Crisis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Coffee Crisis is an arcade-style beat 'em up full of caffeinated carnage!
