They eventually began allowing people to use custom music, but this is not factored into their score. Once they finished designing their level, they would submit an IPS file, it would get judged + ranked, and that would be the end of it. This year, however, S.N.N. decided to assign resources (secondary exits, Map16 slots, etc) to users with the intention of putting all of their levels into a ROM and essentially creating a full hack out of it. The hack features 82 submitted entries and 4 switch palaces, which makes a grand total of 86 levels for you to beat. All of the levels are open from the start - you can play them in any order you’d like. To help you keep track of your progress, the game autosaves on the world map and beating a level will give you an “M” in the top right corner of the overworld. As a disclaimer, the levels are organized on the overworld by theme, and not by ranking. This means that the quality of the levels might fluctuate dramatically from one to the next (e.g. having a 70th place entry directly before a 12th place entry). The bottom 8 and top 8 each have their own world, however, so it’s easy to distinguish them from the rest.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5v07.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SMW Central","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":228393,"name":"Tower of Pain","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tower Of Pain is a small roguelike game with simplified mechanics and small assets (very small assets)… made for fun only!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5v08.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arduboy"}]},{"id":228394,"name":"Turtle Bridge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A fan-made remake of the classic Game and Watch game Turtle Bridge.\n\nCarry the package to the awaiting truck by jumping across the turtle’s backs.
