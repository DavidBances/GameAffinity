Set in the Elder Scroll’s Third Era, during the cataclysmic Oblivion Crisis, you must help to restore the Imperial throne and repel the demonic Daedric invasion.\n\nSkyblivion will feature the remastered entirety of Oblivion’s mainland, Cyrodiil, from the wintery slopes of the Valus and Jerall Mountains to the swamps of Blackwood and warm-beachy shores of the Gold Coast. Skyblivion will bring the return of many classic Oblivion mechanics like spell crafting, a complete class and attributes system, underwater combat, and NPC disposition.\n\nIn addition to recreating Oblivion’s systems and porting them into the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim’s engine the project has taken great care in providing new improvements and additions. Skyblivion offers fans remastered graphics, weather, and lighting, an expanded soundtrack, new gameplay mechanics, and even a limited selection of bespoke minor quests with original voice acting to further flesh out barren areas of Oblivion—all for free!\n\nOnce Skyblivion is released in 2025, fans will have access to the entirety of Oblivion’s pre-DLC world space, systems, and quests available for play.

In this game, however, the protagonist was a strange cross between a dolphin and a bird. Speaking with the animal it was possible to became his friend, feed him and explore the world.\nFor many it will be a shocking news, but “Teo” is not the name of the dolphin / bird, but of the planet where he is living. Known under the title “FinFin on Teo, the Magic Planet”, the virtual puppy FinFin made his first appearance on a PC game released in 1996. According to the producers, the 64DD version was not a porting, but a completely new game. The development of Teo for 64DD was probably stopped because of the failure of the Disk Drive, and it is likely that we will never know how different the 64DD game was supposed to be.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co854h.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"64DD"}]},{"id":299563,"name":"DT Bloodmasters","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"We don't have much information on DT 64 (also known as “Bloodmaster”): the game was supposed to be an Card RPG with an interesting connection-mode between the 64DD and the Game Boy. The game was in development by Marigul and Media Factory and probably it would have been published by Nintendo. The player had to collect a series of cards to use them in combat as in Magic The Gatering.\n\nDT 64 was shown at the Space World 1999 in a non-playable form: there was just a logo and some text , with the GameBoy Link Cable, that would have been used to connect the two Nintendo consoles. The GameBoy could have been used as a controller for the 64DD game, to check the card statistics and share data with a presumed Bloodmaster GB version. The two games, one for the 64DD and one for the GB, would had exchanged data to integrate parts of the story and unlock new levels / cards. Players would have been able to play online with the 64DD Randnet Network, to trade cards and complete their collection.\n\nIn a scan from a Japanese magazine, we can read: “A controller with a brain.” Even if the translation is not accurate because an ideogram is hide by the reflection of the light, making it unrecognizable, the concept is certainly intriguing. Sadly DT64 was cancelled and it vanished without any more screens or info.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co854e.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"64DD"}]},{"id":299558,"name":"Toasterdog in Dreamworld","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Your shift as the Toaster Dog has started, yet you yearn for the appreciation you deserve for your passionate work.
