And as it's a sequel to Metroid Fusion, it presumably would have carried the plot point of Samus being on the run from the Galactic Federation.\n\nNo prototype builds or ROMs have ever surfaced for this DS version, and it is unlikely Nintendo will release any. It's a possibility that concept art or screenshots of this early version will be revealed in the upcoming art book, as Nintendo is open to talking about Metroid Dread's development history.\n\nLiam Robertson of Unseen64 claims that a synopsis of the game was given out to select members of the press. And in 2010, IGN's Craig Harris said in a podcast that he had seen a complete script for Metroid Dread, and that \"Nintendo could use it anytime they wanted.\" It's possible that this was the synopsis that Liam Robertson was referring to.
