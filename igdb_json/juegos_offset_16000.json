They can accomplish this by controlling as much areas of hyperborea as they can, or just crushing the opponent in battle.\n\nPlayers have a mixture of ground and air units to spread terror across the lands of Hyperborea. Also, they have a lot of surprises that can change the fate of any battle. The options are endless.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zngtqllwd9qg8bod7wkc.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kardfy Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":17326,"name":"Kraven Manor","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kraven Manor challenges you to explore an expansive manor and discover the mysteries that lurk in its dark corners.

The world draws its inspiration from history, mythology, and prophecies of the Apocalypse. Most aspects of modern life are now gone. Modern vehicles, weapons, appliances, computer and even the books that describe these things are practically nowhere to be found.\n\nYou are a survivor. Your youth was spent lost in times of war. Your memories of the past with its machines, computers, bright lights and buildings reaching for the skies are vague and ever fading, a distant and unreal dream. You grow accustomed to ancient ways that now once again rule the world.\n\nXsyon is an ever changing dynamic world. Players affect the environment by gathering resources, chopping down trees, hunting animals, building towns and developing trade. Players hold the power to create and destroy, to maintain a balance with nature or to cultivate a new civilization. The game is built around environmental, natural, economic, questing, and social systems. These systems are in constant flux and it's the players interacting with these systems that determine the current state of the virtual world.\n\nXsyon is a fantasy world, but is heavily based on reality. Set in an uncertain apocalyptic future, the virtual world draws upon real life geography, history, science and medicine, fauna and geology are slightly twisted versions of what is real. Whether you are determining what materials to use in a set of armor, trying out ingredient combinations in a recipe or gathering information on the local geography, there is always something new and real you can learn from the Xsyon world.\n\nAs a player, explorer and settler of this new virtual world you have many choices. You can play as a warrior, a trader, a craftsman or a cultivator of crops. You can specialize your skills or become a jack of all trades. You can play as a clan leader or town official, socially involved with many other players, or you can explore the world as a lone adventurer. Xsyon is a game for all kinds of players from casual to hard core. The path you take is up to you.\n\nWhether you are a first day scavenger or a grizzled veteran, Xsyon should be fun. Players begin with a decent set of statistics rather than evolve from a weakling to a super human. You enter the world inexperienced and lacking skill, with strengths and weaknesses, but still as a hero. Rather than grind levels to reach predictable goals, Xsyon is based on change, interactions and consequences. As new quests, lands and features are constantly introduced, there is always something new for you to discover.\n\nBy combining elements of different game genres and social worlds and by blurring the line between fantasy and reality we have created a unique online world. We hope you will find the Xsyon experience fresh, enjoyable, rewarding and full of surprises.\n\nExplore, learn, make friends and create the world you want to live in!

There are dungeons to crawl and loot to procure, but the core gameplay comes during the city-building. As you rebuild the cities in each province, the enemy will not make it easy. You must construct your city so that it not only flourishes, but is well defended. Success requires not only a savvy mind for strategy, but skill with your crossbow to cut down the enemy before they reach your walls.\n\nYou will not be questing alone. As you travel throughout the land, you will rescue people who have been taken by the evil forces in the land. When you rescue them, they will be available to add to your party, or to reside in the main castle where their particular talents will aid your journey outside of combat. Fans of the Suikoden series will quickly recognize its influence on Heroes of Issachar.\n\nCombat\n\nThe action takes place as a first person shooter. Your signature weapon is a crossbow. Throughout the game, you will modify the crossbow, exchanging parts for new ones that confer a benefit to your skill and damage. In addition, there are mounting points for frost cannons, fireball launchers, magic shields, and many more add-ons. How you outfit your crossbow depends on you.\n\nIn addition to your crossbow, you will have a magic gauntlet that augments your skills. Different gems enhance different abilities, like speed, jumping, and even gliding. Other gems allow special skills like teleport and invisibility. Between the gauntlet and crossbow, you have the freedom to customize your combat in almost countless ways.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Blue Mana Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":17513,"name":"Pitiri 1977","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pitiri 1977 is an adventure-platformer with much exploration in both world and story, and is paying tribute to its classic pioneers ‚Äì not only by its gameplay, but also by its background story.

In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world .

Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure.\n\nYou will be able to develop dozens of programs.
