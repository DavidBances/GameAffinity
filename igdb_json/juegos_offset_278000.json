The overall objective is to destroy the enemy base which is defended not only by a fleet, but by installations of sentry cannons, shield generators and submarine torpedo bases. To do this, the player must deploy energy rigs to rifts on the ocean floor to power their Gateship and summon a Velnai’i fleet to aid them in battle. In addition, the player may use their engineers to build new forward bases for battlefield repairs, or to take control of destroyed enemy installations.\nThe Manta itself is a fighter craft capable of “flight” underwater. When in the air, it uses a targeting system similar to modern fighter jets – using radar lock to target its missiles, and straight aiming for its twin plasma cannons. Battle in the air involves not only dogfights with enemy interceptors, but assaults on massive enemy capital ships.\nUnderwater, however, combat is more of a cat-and-mouse game. The player must use a combination of active and passive sonar to target their enemies. Active sonar gives a better view of the surroundings, but will also reveal the player’s position to enemy submarines. Additionally, the player may use the cover of the oceans to sneak up on enemies above, but beware enemy torpedo bases, mines and attack subs!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6p0w.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":118461,"name":"Rift One","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rift One is a sci-fi FPS where you, Mark maxin get stranded on a alien planet. you must try to find a way off.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1w63.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":118460,"name":"Zombie Racers","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":118456,"name":"Spherythm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Spherythm is a quick and simple rhythm game - press buttons to the beat of the music to destroy incoming arrows while the playfield is rotating, moving and changing colors!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1lav.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":118453,"name":"Winterfall","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Winterfall is an open-world RPG set in the awe-inspiring ancient wilderness of Anor, the Old Kingdom.

Gliding and wings will no doubt be there as the IP’s signature element. NCsoft even claimed Aion 2 will have features which could not be realized in the PC game, and that its vision for the game is “no longer a dream”. Such big lofty words.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is that there are no longer the 2 opposing factions, Elyos and Asmodians (due to the timeline). Players are free to choose to invade others of defend. Another eye-opener is the claim of not having “class segmentation” in Aion 2, with players able to wield different weapons without restrictions and choose their playstyle. NCsoft claims that Aion 2 will “showcase a new battle system that did not exist in the old Aion”.\n\nFinally, another huge change is the removal of gliding constraints found in Aion. While this was not explained in detail, NCsoft is aiming to make gliding part of the combat loop to create a “three dimensional battle system”. NCsoft did not mention what engine Aion 2 is developed on, but my guess is Unreal Engine 4.
