But in the reclusive village of Homaran, a tentative peace is sustained amongst its people.\n\nEir lives simply with her father; her life plain but fulfilling.

Taking refuge in the hands of her allies and a planetary ancestral power that roots itself deeper within her than even she knows, Eir must learn to wield the might of Eathral herself in this tale of magical discovery, devotion, betrayal, and adventure.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7kvb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DragonClaw Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":123663,"name":"Finding Dory: Just Keep Swimming","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123664,"name":"Otona no Gal Jan 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co48lv.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123665,"name":"The Curse of RA","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Curse of RA is an Amiga logical game arcade game released in 1990 by Rainbow Arts.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co796j.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":123666,"name":"Meijin-sen","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123667,"name":"Yosaku","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123668,"name":"Jongbou II","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123669,"name":"Bakenou V3","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9gyk.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":123670,"name":"Baken-ou TV '94","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5v67.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Asmik Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":123671,"name":"Future Noir","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Future Noir is an adventure game that combines elements of first-person shooters and walking simulators.
