Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.\n\nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld.

Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities.\n\nArmed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline.\n\nIn Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7nl6.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":22897,"name":"Chocobo Stallion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Japan-only game centering around the Chocobos.\n\nThe game was inspired by the Chocobo racing minigame at the Gold Saucer in Final Fantasy VII.

Perfects are worth twice as many points as Greats, and steps toward the end are worth progressively higher points than steps toward the beginning.

This color scheme is called \"vivid\" mode, whereby the old scheme of all arrows being the same color is henceforth referred to as \"flat\" mode.

The gameplay of DOA2, and all subsequent Dead or Alive games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds.The other defining feature of DOA2, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. In DOA2 many attacks upon hitting will inflict a stun on the opponent. While stunned, the opponent cannot attack, and cannot guard, but they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6t3o.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":227756,"name":"Dungeon","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dungeon is a VMU game released with Time Stalkers.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Memory Unit / Visual Memory System"}]},{"id":227755,"name":"Stuff","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Stuff is a VMU game released with Time Stalkers.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Memory Unit / Visual Memory System"}]},{"id":227754,"name":"Nanwaka Legend","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Nanwaka Legend is a VMU game released with Time Stalkers.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Memory Unit / Visual Memory System"}]},{"id":227753,"name":"Yogurt's Big Adventure","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Yogurt's Big Adventure is a VMU game released with Time Stalkers.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Memory Unit / Visual Memory System"}]},{"id":227752,"name":"Moonlighter","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A VMU game released with Time Stalkers.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Memory Unit / Visual Memory System"}]},{"id":209353,"name":"Pocket GT Racing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pocket Racing: the definitive racing game for the Gameboy Color.\nSuper smooth real time 3D racing on 32 courses stretching across 4 areas will have you entertained for hours!\n32 cars to customise as you progress.
