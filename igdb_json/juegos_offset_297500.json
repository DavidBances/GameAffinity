Would-be adventurers must be simultaneously cautious because enemies can win by using the same tactics! Each class behaves differently when used. Some classes have abundant movement capabilities and can hit a lot of enemies, while others remain stationary and can safely attack from a far. The gameplay is simple to understand yet savvy players will need to use their warriors and the battlefield strategically to progress farther. \n \nCurrently, Knight Slinger allows players to control up to 500 warriors across multiple game modes including real-time PVP.
