Next time when you park somewhere, keep the following tips in mind to maintain your car properly. Follow the below parking tips in our new free 3d parking game.\n1.For parking, First and the foremost thing you need to do is to reduce the speed to minimum when you have found the place. Then, decide whether you want to go reverse or nose first. Go slowly as this greatly decreases your chance for mistake. In addition, it will get you time to think all your movements and correct your mistakes on the go you can learn this in our 3D parking simulation\n2.While parking your car, leave enough space between your car and adjacent cars. This will help the fellow drivers to move their car out of park easily and without striking yours.\n3.In packed parking lots, drivers get competitive for parking space. This can be very risky. Keeping your vehicle in control is important at all times. Don’t show an offensive behaviour while parking your vehicle. This can annoy other car drivers sharing the same parking region.\n4.Don’t ignore things that make the job of parking easier. If you’re moving backwards, turn around and look behind you; if you’re moving forward, look straight ahead of you. Also ensure that your fellow drivers are aware of your presence.
