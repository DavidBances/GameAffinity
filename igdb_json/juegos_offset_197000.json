The game progresses through a series of land battles over various kinds of terrain -- and the terrain gives varying combinations of advantages and disadvantages. The game has some limited representation of Europe's real-world geographical features, which gives a sense of why they are militarily important. For example, you can see the importance of the Fulda Gap, just as it was important in previous World Wars, and just as it would have been important if the Cold War had become hot.\n\nEach battle has one or more objectives, and also a time limit. To win, you must accomplish your objectives while stopping the enemy from accomplishing his, and you must do this before time runs out. Each objective accomplished earns you a certain number of victory points. At the battle's end, the winner is the player with the most victory points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co42jd.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":176097,"name":"Jeopardy!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based on the TV quiz show of the same name.

The player's putty can stretch in a variety of ways: sidewards to cover ground faster, squash flat to absorb pick-up items, stretch upwards to climb, morph a fist to attack, or inflate to float upwards.\n\nPutty can collect stars that increase his attack power: at first increasing the potency of his punch, but later allowing him to blow darts, electrocute enemies or throw bombs. This star power is reduced every time Putty is hit by an enemy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4amw.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":38850,"name":"ESPN Baseball: Interactive Hitting","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Secrets to becoming a better hitter.

If you're on target, you are rewarded with military archival footage of helicopters shooting rockets, and close up footage of models exploding.\n\nThe on-foot sections follow an identical pattern, though with hand-held cameras placing you in the \"eyes\" of Joker, and black-clad guards taking the place of helicopters. Otherwise, the idea of having a few seconds to react and aim crosshairs is the same. The plot is expanded through occasional cutscenes in both the helicopter and foot sections.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zxouzmnoofs6cesodaot.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD 32X"}]},{"id":19705,"name":"Merchant Prince","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Merchant Prince is a DOS strategy game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jptieboczy4ueiq80y9b.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":19703,"name":"Hammer of the Gods","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hammer of the Gods is a strategy / tactical combat hybrid released in 1994","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gwvo3ri7tcnl4knxwq8l.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":19689,"name":"Stargate","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based on the movie of the same name, a mystical circular portal called a \"Stargate\" has been uncovered and Egyptologist and linguist Daniel Jackson is tasked with solving it.\n\nIn the game you attempt to solve Stargate hyroglph combinations in a \"Welltris\"-puzzle-like manner, either in Hi-Score Skill Mode or 1 player or 2 player Battle Mode.\n\nIt's one of two games published by Acclaim Entertainment between 1994 and 1995 with the same cover art.

Some enemies will only move if you cross their path, some will kill you instantly, some move in straight lines and only turn left or right, and some will try to trap you. Rocks can be used to interpose something between yourself and your enemies, and sometimes must be used to destroy walls or barriers.

One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.\n\nThe basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...\n\nHere's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.\n\nAlso, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.\n\nUnicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them.
