The management mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own model kit based on their real-life counterparts.\n\nThere are over 100 Gunpla kits to choose from, which gives you endless building opportunities! You can colorize parts, define material types such as plastic or chrome, add decals, scale optional loadouts, and save your kits into a list to restore whenever you want to fight with that model.\n\nAside from customizing the entire body, you get a shield, melee weapon, and ranged weapon slot for your primary arsenal, 4 Ex-Actions for explosive attacks, and 8 slots for your optional loadouts which can include missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, beam sabers, axes, and all sorts of other offensive and defensive mechanisms. This is one of the most freeform combat experiences ever made in 3rd person arena combat.\n\nTwo escorts join you in most of the battles, performing healing and attack actions while also rescuing you from being knocked out. You can also instruct them to do certain actions.\n\nA new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode, players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency and all parts that have been broken off of enemy kits.\n\nThe Break Edition includes all the DLC of the normal edition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kys.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":134406,"name":"Chimney Presents","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A game by Daniel Linssen.

Dozens of versions and tributes to the game, both official and unofficial, have been created for virtually every computer, console, handheld, tablet, phone, and operating system in the decades since its original release. It is undoubtedly a classic from the golden era of arcade games.\n\nShoot The Rocks is a little different in that it runs cross-platform, on both desktop and laptop computers, as well as on iOS and Android phones and tablets. This is thanks to the fact that it runs in browser using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, rather than Adobe's proprietary Flash platform. This means that no special plugins are required and, if you have a recent version of a mainstream browser, you should be good to go.\n\nIn Shoot The Rocks the aim of the game is to defend your ship from wave after wave of incoming asteroids and flying saucers. This sounds simple but quickly becomes very challenging, and you'll need to use every trick of fancy flying available to you - plus hyperspace, shield, and flip functions - to stay in the game.\n\nShoot The Rocks combines elements of both the original Asteroids, along with its follow-up, Asteroids Plus, with its own unique spin to create an engaging and addictive game. Two modes of play are offered. Classic mode aims to play as much like the original asteroids as possible, whilst the modern mode offers a slightly different take that should appeal to both fans of the original and newer players.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pk4gnb0wmycg3umezsqb.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"arcade.ly","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":28594,"name":"Phantasmat: The Endless Night - Collector's Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"From best-selling developer Eipix comes the exciting continuation of a classic Phantasmat brand!\n\nIn this chilling story, you're on your way to take your daughter to her high school prom when tragedy strikes.
