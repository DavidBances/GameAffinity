It is the first in a series of four Nazoler games.\n\nNazoler Land Soukan-gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off.\n\nNazoler Land Soukan-gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are:\n\nRotation Maze\nA maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze.\n\nNazoler Fortune-Telling\nDespite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star).\n\nSuper Jigsaw\nIn this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge.\n\nSave Princess Momoko!\nPromoted as the \"major feature\", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error.\n\nJapan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz\nA quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it.\n\nFamicom Reaction Test\nIn this simple \"game\", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel.\n\nExtrusion Puzzle\nSimilar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once.\n\n3D Maze\nA simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance. The goal is to simply find the way out.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sbfmcq4n0rie86fd33n4.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer Disk System"}]},{"id":130828,"name":"Extermination","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co63a0.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":81493,"name":"Bermuda Triangle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bermuda Triangle is a vertically scrolling shooter released in arcades by SNK in 1987.

Before he died, he told his three sons that the talisman was stolen by the evil Necromancer, and must be retrieved at all costs... \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is a role-playing game in which the player can assume control of any of the three brothers - Julian, Philip, or Kevin. Each of the three has his own strengths: Julian is the archetypal melee fighter, Philip has high luck and intelligence, while Kevin is known for his kindness. Should the player fail while controlling one of the brothers, the next one will replace him. Each brother will be revived a few times when vanquished by an enemy, until his luck runs out, at which point he will die permanently. \n \nMuch of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring the large world, interacting with non-playable characters and building up the brothers' combat abilities by participating in battles. The fastest-growing parameter is bravery, which is comparable to experience points and strength combined. Each defeated enemy yields bravery points; as it grows, so does the hero's vitality (maximum hit points), albeit at a slower rate. Combat system is rather simple and is done in action style, with the player pressing a key or a mouse button while navigating the protagonist towards or away from the enemy. Predating Ultima V, the game has a day and night cycle, and the main character has to eat and rest. \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is notable for having a very vast world, usually considered the largest ever created for a video game at the time of its release. Players can explore approximately 17,000 screens of terrain. The world is also interconnected, i.e. there are no transitions between different types of areas. Items can be dropped by enemies as well as found anywhere in the game's world. There is also NPC interaction and quests the protagonist can undertake.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fqnqeorkpug2yob8kysy.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":47556,"name":"Blow Up!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Blow Up! the player takes on the role of Joe Kowalski who must navigate his way to the exit in six progressively more difficult caverns.

At a young age, he lost an arm and eye, and was soon ridiculed by his peers for it. Eventually, it proved to be too much, and Gaou became a thief. In spite of his corrupt lifestyle, however, he was able to settle down with a wife - for a while, at least. It all came crashing to a halt over one little disagreement, as Gaou cussed her out... and then killed her!\n\nFilled with remorse, Gaou chose to repent his wicked deeds, and turned to a Buddhist monk for help. The monk's teachings eventually led him to pursue his passion for sculpting, which led to a series of powerful works renowned for the raw emotions pent up inside him that were expressed therein. But it wasn't enough - Gaou needed to be completely reborn! Hearing about the mystical phoenix, who grants those who drink its blood eternal life, from a fellow sculptor named Akanemaru, Gaou set out on a journey to find the great bird of fire... and hopefully to be reincarnated...\n\nBased on the \"Hō-ō\" (or \"Karma\" volume) of Osamu Tezuka's famous manga Hinotori (or \"Phoenix\"), \"Hinotori\" is a vertically-scrolling shooting game where Gaou's goal is to locate the mystical phoenix across 6 stages of labyrinths, enemies and various other obstacles. As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots. In order to reach the final boss and pay a visit to the phoenix, Gaou must obtain a series of keys scattered across the stages - and must even backtrack to find others. The game is over when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has reached the phoenix's lair.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co967e.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":41722,"name":"AshGuine Story II: Kokuu no Gajou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The time had come to put an end to the long and unproductive battle.

There is no scrolling and Gordon's air supply acts as time limit.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4xmt.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":28441,"name":"Seabase Delta","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/athhnopklg6v0m6oqxru.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":28436,"name":"Spiky Harold","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bryj7p6b0sk4tg0fvrre.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore 16"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":28435,"name":"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/stofnywalrzxlig1es0t.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":28385,"name":"Super Sprint","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Sprint is a racing video game released by Atari Games and Midway Games in 1986.
