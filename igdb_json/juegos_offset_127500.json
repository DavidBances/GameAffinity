To do this, you must combine your skill in combat with your ability to build a city capable of withstanding the enemy's assault and launching an attack on the enemy stronghold itself.\n\nGameplay consists of two main perspectives: FPS and city-building. There are dungeons to crawl and loot to procure, but the core gameplay comes during the city-building. As you rebuild the cities in each province, the enemy will not make it easy. You must construct your city so that it not only flourishes, but is well defended. Success requires not only a savvy mind for strategy, but skill with your crossbow to cut down the enemy before they reach your walls.\n\nYou will not be questing alone. As you travel throughout the land, you will rescue people who have been taken by the evil forces in the land. When you rescue them, they will be available to add to your party, or to reside in the main castle where their particular talents will aid your journey outside of combat. Fans of the Suikoden series will quickly recognize its influence on Heroes of Issachar.\n\nCombat\n\nThe action takes place as a first person shooter. Your signature weapon is a crossbow. Throughout the game, you will modify the crossbow, exchanging parts for new ones that confer a benefit to your skill and damage. In addition, there are mounting points for frost cannons, fireball launchers, magic shields, and many more add-ons. How you outfit your crossbow depends on you.\n\nIn addition to your crossbow, you will have a magic gauntlet that augments your skills. Different gems enhance different abilities, like speed, jumping, and even gliding. Other gems allow special skills like teleport and invisibility. Between the gauntlet and crossbow, you have the freedom to customize your combat in almost countless ways.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Blue Mana Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":249384,"name":"Bold Moves","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"What do you get when you combine match 3, word puzzles, and inspirational quotes?

Do you agree that everything is fair in love and war? Would you like to take a chance with a new, refreshing indie strategy game? If your answer to these questions is yes, then I’m happy to introduce Diplomata the game to you!\nThis cross platform multiplayer browser based strategy game is really worth giving it a try! Diplomata takes place in the end of the 21st century, after the collapse of the human civilization we know.\nThe boundaries of the once-existed states have stayed the same, but some countries became more powerful than others. A player has to strive to build a country that’s wealthier than others, knowing that other players will try to achieve the same goal. So, it’s up to a player to use everything from diplomacy to war to develop the most powerful country. This is a turn-based game and a player gets 3 turns in every minutes (300 turns is maximum, though). Turns are made for developing of the country (improving industry, agriculture or building objects) and for interaction with allies and enemies (sending help, attacking, secret service actions etc.).\nEvery player has enough time to analyze, think and plan before they make a turn. Plus, having equal number of turns enables equal game. Diplomata is also played in rounds with every round lasting one month and first day in the next month every player starts from zero, which gives all players opportunity to plan new round from the very beginning and, of course, to take revenge on enemies. If you like games that require both social and strategy skills and allow players to team up with other players or compete against them, Diplomata might be an ideal strategy game for you. With hundreds (and counting) players from all around the globe, this game promises a rewarding gaming experience. It’s perfect for those players who don’t fancy downloading or installing anything in order to play games, since it’s fully browser based.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jjlmuzywloxcjwxslpgz.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ofanziva","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":34008,"name":"The Admin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the distant future, there are rumors of a mysterious cyborg running an abandoned hidden research facility on a planet far from the center of human civilizations.His mysterious origin attracts the Star System Governments to investigate the truth of this cyborg called The Admin and reclaim the facility with all its researches inside.
