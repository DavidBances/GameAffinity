Launch ghosts, drop an anvil on the thief's head, use evil cacti and this is the lesser part of what you have to use. MANIPULATION: It is not enough to set a trap and wait, you need to lure the thief into it. Manipulate the attention of thieves with sounds: hit vases and boxes, blow up barrels. Now they play by your rules. MECHANISMS: Sometimes traps aren't enough to defeat a well-trained thief. Then mechanisms come to the rescue. Transport belts to deliver a stone directly to the head or a magnetic wheel to remove armor from a thief. SAFE-CRACKING: Otti has lost the keys to his safes, you will need to pass the safe cracking mini-games to get the coveted gold. TREASURE: Collect all the gold to the treasury, fill it to the top. Find secret objects to replenish your treasury with unique items.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2orh.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Maksym Vostruhin","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ultimate Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":142526,"name":"Misery Mansion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Misery Mansion is a first-person survival horror game.
