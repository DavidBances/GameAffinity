Tomoya's glee at being part of the eroge industry is short-lived, as he soon learns that Flower is on the chopping block due to their first title being a massive failure. \n \nAfter playing through Flower's first title, Tomoya realizes that his co-workers don't know anything about eroge, lacking the insight and understanding needed to make a good game. After some nudging from the president of Flower's parent company and some soul searching of his own, our protagonist takes it upon himself to save Flower by teaching the four girls on staff the ins and outs of what makes an eroge good. The story thus focuses on Tomoya's role as a psuedo-consultant while getting to know the four heroines of the story as the player is given an interesting look at the world of eroge development.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1v9n.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CLOCKUP team.ANISE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MangaGamer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"AiCherry","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"AiCherry","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CLOCKUP team.ANISE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HOBIBOX Co., Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HOBIBOX Co., Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":127665,"name":"Free Friends","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1v9o.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Noesis","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MangaGamer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"AiCherry","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DVD Player"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":127669,"name":"Grimalkin: Solar Defense Force","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Command a Rag Tag fleet of Grimalkin Vessels against the evil from Beyond.
