And space is not empty: There are thousands of star systems, planets, moons, nebulas, wormholes and asteroid fields waiting to be explored and exploited. Each sector of the universe offers a unique variety of resources and procedurally generated content. \n \nSelect the right ship for your journey from hundreds of different hulls, with different size, speed and and capabilities. Customize your spacecraft further with extra skins and models. Select your loadout from thousands of modules, weapons, rigs and equipment. Players can choose from hundreds of skills and traits in an innovative hybrid character progression system. The choice of skill is entirely up to the player, there are no mutually exclusive skill branches. Skills do not limit access to modules and ships, but they augment their specialization and effectiveness. \n \nThere are four major NPC factions: The Foundation, The Tauri Dominion, The Solar Empire and The Kerrats. Together with countless minor factions they vie for control over the galaxy, constantly trying to gain the upper hand over one another on their home frontiers. But outside the core systems, in the majority of the galaxy anarchy reigns supreme and everything is free to be taken. Be careful when you venture out there and keep your friends close, but your enemies even closer.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/frfdnoyktwi94erfnjha.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":46021,"name":"Puzzle Scape","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Escape to block-busting puzzles and pulsating beats in this exciting new puzzle game for your PSP® system!

See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students learn how notes are spaced out across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tmuigrngrbiknr7cryhr.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":84636,"name":"Mike the Knight and The Great Gallop","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Join Mike the Knight and Galahad in this Great Gallop adventure packed full of fun puzzles and games!
