Ltd., takes brain exercise software to a new level and offers a whole raft of exciting new games, features and challenges all designed specifically to stimulate and improve the player's brain functions and most importantly, be fun to play in their own right.\n\nTransform gaming curiosity into powerful thinking with MinDStorm. The game features ten distinct types of challenge for players, all of which are simple to pick up and play using the Nintendo DS stylus, touch screen and microphone. Each of MinDStorm's challenges is designed to focus on enhancing the player's reason, endurance, analysis, intuition or observation. Regardless of the type of game chosen, extended play results in improved overall brain function and enhanced memory.\n\nA first for the brain training genre, MinDStorm throws additional challenges and problems into the mix. Players are rewarded with ever more complex riddles to solve as they do well in the main training mode. General knowledge and geography-based challenges are also included to accompany the more abstract trials such as sliding picture puzzles, mazes to navigate with the stylus and spot the difference games.\n\nFurther innovation is found in the way the game will adapt the tasks it asks players to perform according to the local environment it is being played in. When playing on a bumpy car or train ride for instance, MinDStorm will omit the tasks that require precise stylus action. When playing in public the game will spare players the need to vocalize into the Nintendo DS microphone.

As with most T/RPGs, positional advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and maneuvering by the inclusion of \"Formation Arts,\" which increase attack damage when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T/RPGs whose battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. \"Combination Arts\" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will increase significantly.

A new addition to Ryu's arsenal is a pair of dual-wield swords, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang. It also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ninpo, which allows him to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself. By shaking the Sixaxis controller, players are able to increase the power of their ninpo spells. Rachel, a non-playable character in the 2004 game, became playable in three new chapters, featuring the new bosses, Gamov and Alterator. Some of the design elements of the old levels was also changed and several new enemy types were introduced.\n\nIn addition to the narrative Story Mode, Sigma included a gameplay variation called Mission Mode. Focused on action rather than character development, this provides combat-based missions set mainly in small areas. In both Story and Mission modes, game scoring is based on the player's speed in clearing encounters, the number of kills achieved, the number of unused ninpos remaining at the end, and the amount of cash collected.

Instead the setting this time is Syria in the near future.\n\nAs with previous games in the series the focus lies on tactical ground combat battles. Each battle starts with a mission briefing where the player gets to study the strategic and operational maps and gets a description of the mission. After this the player is moved to the 3D battlefield and the Setup Phase where the action is paused. Here the battlefield has setup zones where the player can position his units. The player can here issue commands to his units, which will be activated once the battle begins. When happy with this the player can choose to start the actual battle.\n\nThe game features a number of gameplay styles. In it's most basic form the game is played in simultaneous time, meaning that a second of play time equals a second of real time. Players can however choose to change this to an alternative playing style. In the real-time mode the battles starts after the setup has been completed and only stops if the player chooses to pause the action. In the turn-based mode, each turn of the battle (except for the first) has three phases. It starts with an command phase where the player issues orders. After this comes the action phase where the units execute their orders. This consists of 60 seconds of real-time action. Last is the replay phase where the player can rewind and replay the action. For the first turn of the battle, the action phase is based on the commands given in the setup phase. The player is not able to issue any more commands in the action and replay phases.\n\nEach battle can have a number of different victory conditions based on different objectives. Three main types of objectives exist: terrain-based, unit-based and force-wide objectives. Terrain-based objectives include occupying an area, destroying a building, defend an area or reaching an area. Unit-based objectives can be tied both to single units or to a group of units and include destroying or spotting specific units. Force-wide objectives include the number of casualties, condition of troops and amount of ammo left.\n\nCombat Mission: Shock Force contains two campaign played from the US side: Yakima Training Center and Task Force Thunder. Yakima Training Center is a training mode for new players that teaches the game mechanics. In the Task Force Thunder campaign players take command of a battalion-sized combined arms Task Force across the Syrian border with the goal of splitting the country in two. Combat Mission campaigns are semi-dynamic which means that they consist of both predetermined elements, as well as some that are based on the actions of the player. Each battle's starting conditions depend on the result of the previous battle.\n\nThe game also has QuickBattles, which is battles where the units and the map are randomly generated depending on what parameters are set by the player. Options include environment, size and weather as well as unit types and quality.\n\nThe game supports two player multiplayer. The real-time mode can be played through LAN or Internet, while the turn-based mode can be played in hotseat (two players on the same computer) or through E-mail.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fsx.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":9610,"name":"Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Touch de Dokodon!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Touch de Dokodon is a rhythm game for Nintendo DS by Namco Bandai where you play a Taiko drum to the beat of several songs.

The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University. \n \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level. \n \nThe main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of \"moves\" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results. \n \nObstacles in levels include: \n \nBoxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled. \nGlass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through. \nLaser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level. \nSwitch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them. \nTeleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points. \nPolice officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior. \nDetectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles. \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a \"weekly quiz\" that can be downloaded through the Internet.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2hhw.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":17456,"name":"Bomberman Live","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Classic Bomberman on the Xbox Live arcade.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5u5v.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":862,"name":"Sam & Max: Save the World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The characters can travel between a variety of locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which, when selected, will present the player with a list of available destinations.

It puts one contest against a banker. At the start of the game, the player choose one of the 26 briefcases. They contain prize money ranging from $.01 to $1,000,000. The different amounts are shown on a game board. Each round the player has to open a number of the remaining briefcases which are then marked on the board (six in the first round, five in the second, four in the third). Based on the remaining amount of money, the banker offers the player a deal, a certain amount of money, based on odds. The player can choose to accept the deal when large sums are gone, or decide to go through. After the third round the briefcase is opened and if it contains a higher sum than what the banker offered, the player has made a great deal.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6n17.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Destination Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gravity-i","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":241723,"name":"Zynga Poker","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Zynga Poker is a popular online card game that falls under the casino genre.

As in other match-three games, the player is presented with a grid of tiles (here called tokens) that can be removed by making matches of three or more tiles of the same colour. What makes this variant of the concept different is that the objective isn't just to remove the tokens but to move Spider-Man across the grid to a special destination. Each level has a path that Spider-Man follows. The path is hidden and is only revealed by swapping and removing tokens that are over the path. Spider-Man moves automatically when the path is revealed. Each level is time-based and Spider-Man has to reach his destination before the timer runs out.\n\nThe game features some special power-up tokens that will help the player. For example, there are the scramble tokens that shuffle all tokens on the grid, the spider-sense tokens that reveal the path temporarily, and the rage tokens that can be used to plough through tokens blocking the path. Spider-Man will be chased by black goo on some levels and has to finish the levels before being caught.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5r06.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Pictures Mobile","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":219499,"name":"Timebot","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Timebot is a time traveling puzzle game.
