People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal (\"PS\") and Mind Force (\"MF\") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church.\n\nLaila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases). She can also escape at anytime as long as she can reach the edge of the fighting area. The combat items are complemented by more conventional inventory items such as medic packs, psychic pills, keys and so forth.

The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\n\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25qt.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"WonderSwan Color"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":64271,"name":"Family Trainer: Rairai Kyonshizu","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The tenth and final Bandai game to use the Family Trainer/Power Pad accesssory for the NES.

Each level consists of tiles that make out the spider's web. Problem is that the web is under siege by odd spherical creatures. This has lead to some passageways being broken and now it's up to our little spider to repair the damage done. The aim then is to rebuild these parts of each level so that the spider can move on to the next. This is done with the use of coloured tiles. The HUD shows a flashing dot that indicates what colour is needed. The spider then has to find a tile in that colour and move it to the tile that needs to be repaired. Once this is all done the spider gets access to a teleporter and can move on to the next level. The spider isn't alone however. It has to be careful not to come into contact with the balls that move around the web. Balls can be destroyed by building a web in front of them. They won't be gone for long though since they will respawn after just a few seconds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co88uq.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":300564,"name":"Formula 1","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This simple Amstrad CPC game was published as a listing in the January 1988 issue of the Greek magazine Pixel.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co86rm.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":300243,"name":"Summer Games II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The ZX Spectrum port of Summer Games II sports different graphics due to hardware limitations","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co85yp.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":298940,"name":"Bubble Bobble 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bubble Bobble 2 is a hack for the Amstrad CPC port of Bubble Bobble by someone going by U.W. representing Saturn-Soft a made up developer name.

It was followed by two official sequels, the console and computer title Mighty Bomb Jack, and the arcade game Bomb Jack Twin and Bomb Jack II, which was licensed for home computers only. The highest known score was by Mr G Jones from London: 6 746 800. Bomb Jack is a hero who can perform high jumps and float in the air. His goal is to collect all red bombs on the screen. The game's antagonists are enemies such as birds and mummies which, once they drop in the bottom of the screen, can morph into things like flying saucers and orbs that float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing \"P\" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game. There are five different screens in the game, each featuring a distinct scheme of platforms (the fifth has no platforms at all). There is a special bonus for collecting 21 or more lit bombs in a row, out of the 24 bombs of each round.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8avp.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":266945,"name":"Bomb Jack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one.

The game consists of two different soccer simulations, you can carry out a match in the stadium or indoors. The field is always shown from the top and scrolled softly into all directions. The player that is controlled at the moment can be recognized by a flickering football shirt. If you have the ball you can pass or shoot. The longer you keep the fire button pressed, the sharper the shot will be. Additionally, the trajectory bends if the joystick is pressed to the left or right. If the opponent has the ball, you can try to take it away from him with a sliding tackle. When the own keeper gets visible, you take over his controls and a press on the fire button makes the keeper jump.\n\nIndoor soccer has some fundemental changes to the rules. The ball cannot roll into the out, but it bounces from the cushion. Furthermore, the keeper can be the goalgetter himself (in contrast to the stadium where he is limited to the penalty area).\n\nIf a goal is scored, the scene is repeated in slow motion and one can watch the attack unhurriedly. Extensive and clearly arranged menus enable you to change many parameters of \"Microprose Soccer\". These range from the length of a match (2 to 12 minutes) to details of the controls. Also the weather can be changed and by this you can get a proper rain shower during the game by coincidence. With a wet ground the ball rolls further and the players sometimes slip.\n\nDifferent game modes make for diversity. Up to 15 players can enter their names and then compete with each other in a league. One can also take part in a World Cup, whereby the venue corresponds to the one of a real World Cup. The computer takes over the controls of as many teams as needed. The strengths of the teams correspond approximately to the real national teams (random exceptions can happen). Scores can be saved any time and additionally there is a \"Name Bank\", a database with names of clubs, but there is limited memory, 16 clubs can be created.
