You can be a hero or a villain depending on what tasks you wish to undertake. You can also smuggle, kidnap, assassinate, rescue, kill monsters, deliver items, and more. The game offers non-linear game-play where you can roam as you please in a randomly generated world with each game-play. The game also has Medieval Japan, Arabian, and Medieval European styled environments where you can start from or travel to. You can also recruit your own party members from each area as you wish also.

The game is set in the medieval fantasy world Castalia, and involves battle for dominance between various kingdoms and provinces. Combat is handled in a RTS fashion, with the player- and AI-controlled forces moving on an overhead battle screen and executing commands in real time. The battles occur between medium-size parties led by individual characters with unique attributes and personalities. These leaders also receive experience, level up, and learn magic spells in a RPG fashion. The game's structure and pacing are also reminiscent of an RPG rather than an RTS: there is no base-building or resource management, and the missions involves completing fairly linear stages that consist chiefly of combat and plot-advancing dialogue.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3tw9.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Samsung","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"TWIM","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":170347,"name":"Maverick Gunn and the Eye of Oggun","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are Maverick Gunn, treasure hunter and renegade History teacher.
