Experience a story-driven campaign! Fight for your Sanity and defeat the Lovecraftian horrors.\n\nLast Spartan sees you playing as the titular Last Spartan as you battle through a story-driven randomly generated campaign where keeping a grip on your waning sanity becomes increasingly difficult as you do battle with more and more enemies that draw inspiration from Greek mythology and the Lovecraft mythos.\n\nIt's a roguelike with deck-building elements. The unique part here is that your deck is actually a set of customisable dices, with each face acting as a slot for a different ability. There are over 700+ dice faces to discover, allowing you to develop and learn numerous synergies to suit your preferred playstyle, especially when god selection comes into play.\n\nAside from the dice, you will be accompanied on each run by an ally Greek god. There are over 10 of them currently, although they won't all be unlocked immediately, and each provides distinct active and passive abilities. With them, you can develop different strategies for dealing with the many foes you encounter.\n\nAccording to the developer, for the first ten hours, you will face new enemies on every run, with over 100 regular enemies and 20-plus mini-bosses to discover and fight in turn-based combat. This should keep the game feeling fresh and surprising for far longer than other entries in the genre.\n\nThe same applies to encounters with over 200 NPCs to meet and choices surrounding them to make. Depending on your interaction, they might provide you with a reward, blessings, or even curses that will remain constant until the end of that particular run.\n\nSome of those NPCs will make their way to your city. It's here where you respawn after dying and spend resources you've gathered throughout each run to upgrade the various buildings in a bid to rebuild Sparta. This is the more permanent side of the Last Spartan game and will eventually provide you with perks that increase your chance of completing a run and progressing the overarching story.\n\nThe indie game Last Spartan is set to come out in early access on PC/Mac/Linux via Steam in February-March 2024 and full release coming to all Platforms and major storefronts by April 2024 ( Coming to PC/Mac/Linux first and then to all major consoles like Xbox & Playstation & Nintendo Switch & IOS soon after PC and console release )","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7boc.jpg","releaseYear":2025,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":260390,"name":"Vault of Power","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unleash your tactical prowess in 'Vault of Power', a roguelike auto-battler that plunges you into a treacherous dungeon.
