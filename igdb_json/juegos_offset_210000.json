It’ll run you (pun intended) about as much as a cup of coffee, and is scientifically proven to give you an energy boost equivalent to about eight pounds of espresso beans. Your heart might start beating dangerously fast, but your eyes and ears (and maybe even your nose - why not?) will most definitely thank you.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7oe4.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gaijin Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":226930,"name":"Royal Romances: Battle of the Woods","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Explore additional locations and find all the hidden items!
