The similarities are numerous - some are subtle, some are easily spotted. These include combining archaic technology such as biplanes with more advanced machinery; firing and power-up system; and a medal collecting system which drastically increases scoring. The game features a similar method of earning bombs and a delay when launching them as well.\n\nA notable feature of Ibara is the inclusion of a variable, real-time difficulty system by way of the Rank system. The player's rank increases as they acquire more items and cause more damage, increasing the difficulty of the game along with it. The number of enemies does not increase but the number of bullets fired towards the user does, often reaching a ridiculous level of bullet density.\n\nThere are ways of lowering this rank system if the odds appear too much. The only known way of decreasing the player's Rank in Ibara is to die. The more lives you have, the less the rank decreases when you die.\n\nIn this later version, Ibara Kuro: Black Label, Rank can be decreased by cancelling bullets with a bomb, however Rank also increases much faster in this version, potentially increasing from minimum to maximum in a matter of seconds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/eimtrtvmouynkuaxtyjr.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"AMI","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CAVE Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":9361,"name":"American Conquest: Divided Nation","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"American Conquest: Divided Nation is the second stand alone expansion to American Conquest.

Chris Crawford puts it this way:\n\n\"Wizard was spec'd as a 2K game, but just four months later, when it was ready, the marketing people had decided that everything should be 4K, so they asked me if I could expand it to 4K. To be honest, I really didn't want to work on the 2600 -- I was eager to get going on the 800. So I told them that you don't just expand a 2K game to 4K: you start from scratch and design it for 4K from the ground up. That was true, and marketing lost interest, so I got to move to the 800.\"\n\nSince Wizard was never advertised in any Atari catalogs and it was never assigned a part number, most people don't even know if its existence.\n\nWizard can best be described as a cross between Berzerk and Wizard of Wor. You control a wizard (at least I think he's a wizard), who must attempt to destroy the swirling star shaped creature. The board layout is a giant maze, which makes it hard to run from the creature and to get a clean shot off. Unfortunately the creature can move through the maze walls, but thankfully it can't shoot through them. Once you take a shot you'll notice that your wizard dims a bit, this means you are recharging, and cannot shoot. Once your wizard is done recharging he will light back up again, and you can take another shot. You don't have to worry about aiming you shots, as you will automatically shoot in the direction of the creature. This makes it easy to run away but still take shots at the creature.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co38sz.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Chris Crawford","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atari, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":148201,"name":"McDonald's Video Game","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"McDonald's Video Game is a parody of the business practices of the corporate giant McDonald's, taking the guise of a tycoon-style business-simulation game.
