Unfortunately, a lack of features, shoddy audio presentation, and major gameplay flaws meant that WSB2K1 was not well received by critics despite its fantastic graphics. The game is notorious for its sometimes-unresponsive controls, as well as the fact that manual fielding—a staple of baseball games for a half-decade prior to WSB2K1's release—isn't even an option available to players.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the debacle that was World Series Baseball 2K1, Sega decided to bring Visual Concepts (the developer behind the Dreamcast's far more successful NBA 2K and NFL 2K series) in for the next version of the game.

Enemies will be trying to hinder your progress by firing at you, but you can cancel out their shots with your own, or even deflect them by swinging your gohei.

The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.[1] \n \nGameplay[edit] \nAt the start of the game, Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries and steal these ingredients from him.[2] After the opening level, the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.[2] Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies in the guise of walking sausages, eggs, pickles, and spoons. Players have the ability to spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds, allowing players to escape.[2] Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below.[3] \n \nThe platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle).[3] As the player progresses in the game, more enemies are added.[citation needed] Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to either trap them between the falling burger ingredients or to temporarily freeze them with pepper.[citation needed] However, players can only a small supply of pepper at any given time (4 bottles could be carried).[2] Players can pick up coffee cups or ice creams that appear on the screen (when they are down to their last pepper pot), rewarding them with an extra pepper pot.[2] Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.[citation needed]","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":46082,"name":"Rakugaki Showtime","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rakugaki Showtime is a game along the same vein as Poitter's Point (also known as Poy Poy) where in you try to defeat the opponents by throwing things at them.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3xou.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Enix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Treasure","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":46083,"name":"Zanac X Zanac","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Zanac X Zanac is a shoot'em up game released by Compile to commemorate the 15th anniversairy of the original game.

That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out.

Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two modes: Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online.\n\nThe meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000, enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races: Standard, Trial and Vendetta.\n\nStandard races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one: breaking speed limits at certain points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash flow. Trial races involve wagering: a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options. These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner taking the loser's car.\n\nThe game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks in 12 configurations), adds a \"Heavy Winter\" configuration to the Canada track and adds one new track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable.

The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided.\n\nCombat is turn-based, utilizing an \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques.\n\nThe game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9dlh.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Microcabin","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Aisystem Tokyo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"}]},{"id":46383,"name":"Tenka Fubu Eiyuu-tachi no Houkou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tenka Fubu: Eiyuutachi no Houkou is a simulation game for the Sega Mega-CD.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ec4kjmnxhre6clkinw7p.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"}]},{"id":46384,"name":"Tenbu Mega CD Special","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tenbu Mega CD Special is a Sega Mega-CD simulation game released exclusively in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72z8.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"}]},{"id":46385,"name":"Egawa Suguru no Super League CD","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Egawa Suguru no Super League CD (江川卓のスーパーリーグＣＤ) is a baseball game released as part of the Super League and a sequel to Pro Yakyuu Super League CD (?).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72yr.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"}]},{"id":46386,"name":"Pro Yakyuu Super League CD","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pro Yakyuu Super League CD (プロ野球スーパーリーグＣＤ) is a baseball game released as part of the Super League series for the Sega Mega-CD exclusively in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72z1.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"}]},{"id":46387,"name":"Quiz Scramble Special","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Quiz Scramble Special is a Sega Mega-CD quiz game released exclusively in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72z2.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"}]},{"id":46388,"name":"Mega Schwarzschild","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mega Schwarzschild (メガシュヴァルツシルト) is a Sega Mega-CD simulation game released exclusively in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co72z0.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"}]},{"id":46389,"name":"Mahou no Shoujo: Silky Lip","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mahou no Shoujo: Silky Lip (魔法の少女シルキーリップ) is an adventure game for the Sega Mega-CD.
