The game seems to act as a prequel to Future Shock, with the most advanced technology and player weapons from that game not appearing in the course of the single-player missions in SkyNET.\n\nThe multiplayer game allows for eight players over a LAN and two over IPX. The levels are contained recreations of sections or ideas in the single-player game, like a block of cityscape, a shattered freeway, or an open valley, and many can be played at either dawn or dusk. Vehicles are available in most levels, and unlike in single-player, can be entered and exited freely. You also have the option to play as a Terminator, with reduced movement speed, a little more toughness, and the classic red-tinted vision with information overlays.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2zh8.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":179910,"name":"BS Dragon Quest: Dai-4-wa","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The fourth and final episode of BS Dragon Quest.\n\nBS Dragon Quest is a version of Dragon Quest released for the Super Famicom add-on peripheral Satellaview, via broadcast, in Japan.

And you get the privilege of a great start. Indeed, an irritated stewardess decides to send you to your destination via a shortcut... by throwing you out of the plane with a parachute.\n\nAfter a forced landing through a ceiling, here you are, at Hourai High School. The year hasn't started yet and teachers already have you in their sights. You'll get to meet new friends real soon however, particularly the guys behind the school's newspaper \"Hourai Sports\". You'll even get the chance to take the place of the editor, even though you are the one who sent him to hospital by landing on his head. But the course of your new school year will soon be disrupted by the establishment of extravagantly oppressive school laws, which seem to be manipulated from behind the throne.\n\nSome may compare this game to Mother 2, seeing the delirious scenario and modern setting. They wouldn't be entirely wrong, as Hourai Gakuen no Bouken, more than its atypical universe, shares with it classical RPG gameplay and first-person battles.

It's based on the school campus's map, with each of its parts constituting \"villages\" of some sort, and to which the player will be required to come back regularly to use the services housed in the main buildings. The limits of the world map will widen as the chapters that lead us through the school year unfold, and more exotic and less \"academic\" regions will gradually make their apparition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2x7c.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":20260,"name":"NBA ShootOut","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"NBA ShootOut was released in 1996 and was Sony's first basketball game on their 32-bit PlayStation.
