A half-sized version of the distinctively styled Atari 400, emulating the whole 8-bit Atari range from the 400 to the 800XL, and the Atari 5200 home console.\nAlso included is a recreation of the classic Atari CX40 joystick, with an additional seven seamlessly integrated function buttons.\nPlay one of the 25 built-in games, including: Lee, Berzerk, Millipede, Miner 2049er, M.U.L.E, Star Raiders II, and save your progress at any point in one of four save slots per game, or even pause and rewind gameplay to help you through the most difficult parts - a feature new to THE400 Mini.\nThe multi-region THE400 Mini features HD visuals output via HDMI and with five USB ports, you can connect additional controllers or a standard PC keyboard.\nAnd as with all Retro Games releases you are free to play content you own via a USB flash drive, and learn to program in BASIC. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the world of retro computing, THE400 Mini has something to offer.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8gej.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Retro Games Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"PLAION","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Plug & Play"}]},{"id":285569,"name":"The Forgotten Villages of Gondomayit 2\" Kost Karangsari","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bagas, a native of Yogyakarta, is a vocational school student who lost a bet and received a challenge from his friends, he had to test his courage in one of the boarding houses in Gondomayit Village, whose residents had long been abandoned after the eruption of Mount Merapi.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7q5f.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":283059,"name":"Black Stone","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The game will center around two investigators who uncover a profound terror while delving into consecutive disappearances.
