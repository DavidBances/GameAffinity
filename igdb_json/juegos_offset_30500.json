Offer up the resources to Inanna and use the goats to trade for new workshops and abilities. Only the swiftest and cleverest noble will become the ruler of Sumer.\n\nA Worker Placement Video Game!\nSumer takes the board game mechanic of worker placement to a new level. Each day, you and your competitors will awaken at dawn to begin your worship. Run and jump around the ziggurat to place your workers so they'll collect resources. You only have 2 workers, so you better figure out your strategy, move fast, and claim workshops before your friends beat you to it!\n\nReal-time Dynamic Auctions!\nWhoever is willing to sacrifice the most goats gets Inanna's blessing! The auction is simple — just move left or right to change your bid in real time. Each auction is a mind game of bluffing and bravado, and you never know an item’s real price until time is up! Trick your opponents into overpaying for their bids while you snag good bargains for your own!\n\nKey Features\n1-4 players - Play local with up to 4 players. Master playing solo or try to beat up to three of your friends.\nDevious AI - A variety of personalities and skill levels makes the game a challenge for any player.\nComfortable game length - With a game experience of 20 to 30 minutes, Sumer plays in a fraction of the time of a comparable strategy board game.\nInfinitely replayable - Randomized setup and a huge variety of different auction items make each playthrough a unique strategic experience.\nNuanced strategies - There is no single key to winning. Being quick on your feet and making smart long-term investments are both crucial to victory.\nSumerian culture - We’ve worked with professional historians to bring you the ancient civilization that invented writing, beer, and board games.\nCustomizable gameplay - Play the way you want by turning on variants like Big Head mode and Hidden Auction Items.\nYour controls - The game can be played with controllers, mouse and keyboard, all at the same time!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2rgr.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Studio Wumpus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":32922,"name":"Hiiro","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hiiro is a 2D platform game focused on ambient exploration and puzzle solving.
