Rhythm Tengoku contains 48 minigames that put your rhythm to the test in a variety of crazy scenarios.\n\nRhythm Tengoku was developed by Nintendo R&D1 and released exclusively in Japan for the GBA in 2006 and in arcades with Sega's help in 2007. Being developed by the same studio responsible for the WarioWare games, Rhythm Tengoku mixes the mini-game based gameplay with rhythm game elements, featuring unusually high-quality music for a GBA game. The game started development in 2004. A 2002 prototype for a GBA drum sequencer was incorporated into Rhythm Tengoku as well: the player can freely drum within the Sound Test or take on 19 drum lessons. (Source)\n\nThe game contains eight stages with five rhythm games and one remix of the previous five each, adding up to 48 different mini-games total. Each game can be completed without hitting every note perfectly, although doing so will unlock various rhythm-related bonus games and modes, such as a drum set where you have to mimic what the drummer does.\n\nMuch like the Wario Ware series of games, Rhythm Tengoku is all about following your senses and trying to be aware of various cues in the visuals and audio. This emphasis on sense instead of language makes it quite easy for anyone to pick up and play, even though the game is entirely in Japanese (and consequently only available in the Asian region or through an import website).\n\nFor example, one of the game's levels has you rapping with a computer-controlled character. He'll speak a colour-coded Japanese phrase, and the player must press 'A' in different rhythms. Although the game explains what rhythms to do for which phrase, non-Japanese speaking players can watch hand movements on-screen to figure it out without the need for language.\n\nOccasionally, challenges will crop up, asking you to complete a level without any mistakes. Doing so earns you a certificate for that level, and a pink heart with a 'P' on it appears in that level's description.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2r4w.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"J.P.Room Recordings","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo SPD Production Group No. 1","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":274181,"name":"Testing Facility","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Esselmap I: Testing Facility is a single-level PWAD for Doom II using a limit removing source port.

Entirely original to SRB2 is its Multiplayer mode, a variation of classic first-person shooter games with Sonic elements.

It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series.\n\nGameplay\nBefore starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash.\n\nWhen one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will \"attract\" your star towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad.\n\nWhen not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it.\n\nThere are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it's red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get out of its way. Sometimes these hazards will even revolve around stars.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co525b.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Skip Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49482,"name":"Bit Generations: Soundvoyager","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bit Generations: Soundvoyager is a Game Boy Advance video game released in July of 2006.

The game features 34 characters, covering events from the Soul Society: The Sneak Entry arc to Ulquiorra Schiffer's introduction at the beginning of The Arrancar arc. Unique to Heat the Soul 3 are \"Soul Road\" and \"Karakura Heroes.\" In Soul Road, the player is to select the desired character and partner character. Afterwards, the player is set on a board game-like map where the goal is to pass through markers in order to fight enemies. After each match, the player is given an amount of \"Trust points\" (how many received depends on the mode's difficulty) which go towards leveling up partner characters and unlocking bonuses, such as alternate costumes and new partners. To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points; however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added. Don Kanonji leads a group of shinigami, initially Byakuya Kuchiki and T≈çshir≈ç Hitsugaya, on some sort of wacky adventure which involves battling several other characters. At the mode's completion, a scene shows the gang relaxing at an expensive hotel, doing activities that in some way fit their personalities and/or abilities (for example, Hitsugaya snowboarding).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pq7.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Eighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":70563,"name":"Sekai no Gohan Shaberu!

After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2vtb.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco Bandai Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CyberConnect2","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":78291,"name":"Pop'n Music Fever!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The 14th game in the Pop'n Music franchise.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6n1l.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bemani","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami Digital Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":7059,"name":"Love Football","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripci√≥n","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/evwonb196qe3du4vevsp.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":248534,"name":"X-Men: The Official Game","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"X-Men: The Official Game (also known as X3: The Official Game) is Activision's tie-in video game to the 2006 film X-Men: The Last Stand.
