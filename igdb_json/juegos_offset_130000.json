You stand on the edge of the pit. Uncle Henry hands you a container of nuclear waste, which you maneuver above the pit with the joystick. Press the button to drop it. The can falls into the pit and bounces along the pile of waste until it comes to rest. Simple, right? Well, almost... \n \nThere are three types of waste containers, each having its own distinct shape and color. The catch is that a container may not end up on or next to a container of the same type. If it does, POW-the end of your little corner of the world! \n \nMomentary contact between containers of similar waste is allowed. For example, a container of Type 1 waste may be dropped onto another Type 1 container as long as it bounces to a different location and does not come to rest in contact with Type 1 waste. \n \nAlso, you can only hold a can for a short time (depending on which speed you selected). When you are handed a can, a timer in the upper right-hand corner of the screen counts down. When it reaches zero, a buzzer sounds and you must drop the waste in your tracks. Needless to say, this could be disastrous. \n \nYou get 10 points for every container successfully dumped. If you manage to fill the pit by placing just one container of waste as high as the pit's rim, you get a 1,000-point bonus, some neat special effects and an early retirement.

With a focus on object physicality, these tasks are difficult to maintain alone, encouraging interaction with the humans who inhabit the world the players find themselves in. Different NPCs are better at certain tasks than others, and should be assigned to tasks accordingly. NPCs will develop relationships with each other based on interests, co-operative tasks, and other factors, which lead to scenarios of comradery, rivalry, affection and disdain. As time passes and NPCs grow together, families will form, babies will be born and elders will pass away.

You will quickly realize this. \n \n-Hold to charge and jump \nCan you master something as simple as jumping with the right amount of power, let alone account for angles, velocity and the rotation when you jump? \n \n-Preparation is your best asset \nWhen you're in the air, you cannot change the path you have chosen. \n \nThere's no auto-save. \nPlan your jumps. The consequences can be dire. \nMake sure your angles isn't too sharp and your velocity isn't too high. \nBe prepared to make mistakes.
