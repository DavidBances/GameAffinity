Milne's Winnie the Pooh series of short stories.\nEach character had lost an item of value to them and wanted the item returned. The player moves through the Hundred Acre Wood and collects the missing items then returns them to their rightful owners. Only one item can be carried at a time, so picking up one item means leaving behind of whatever item is currently being carried. Some screens have interactive sub elements. For example: you could \"climb\" Pooh's tree and see the limb where he kept his honey pots safely out of the reach of flood waters (a reference to a scene in the Disney animated movie \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\"and Chapter 9 of A.A. Milne's book Winnie-the-Pooh.). The game has no animation in the mode of a traditional Quest game such as King's Quest. Rather, the Hundred Acre Wood existed as a grid of connected static screens. Players move between the screen using the arrow keys and can only move North, South, East or West. The missing items are randomly assigned at the start of each new game to screens within this grid, although the various characters can always be found on the same screens. When an item is \"dropped\" on a screen in order to \"pick up\" another item, the dropped item stays on that screen until the user returns to retrieve it later.\nReuniting a character with their item results in a celebration screen.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5vq3.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50491,"name":"Thomas M.

The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; each player is differentiated by color. Thus, instead of having a \"warrior\", \"wizard\", and \"valkyrie\" (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a \"red wizard\", a \"blue elf\" and a \"green warrior\".\n\nIn addition to the new \"class\" system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features included the enemy \"It\", which upon contact would make a player \"It\" and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy.\n\nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits.\n\nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don't be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).\n\nThis sequel was also the first to feature what is now known as the Gauntlet theme tune, which resembles a simplified Baroque fugue.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5fnt.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":1873,"name":"Defender of the Crown","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Age of Chivalry!

The bolt can be small and hollow, large and hollow, small and solid or large and solid and these properties have to match with the properties of the box and the parts.

There is also the bouncer which rebounds the bolt in the opposite direction and the key which the bolt has to pass through to enter a locked box.\n\nThe game consists of 200 machines. The first 100 only uses regular parts while the latter 100 contains modified parts. These differ in that their properties change every time they are touched by the bolt.

The highest known score was by Mr G Jones from London: 6 746 800. Bomb Jack is a hero who can perform high jumps and float in the air. His goal is to collect all red bombs on the screen. The game's antagonists are enemies such as birds and mummies which, once they drop in the bottom of the screen, can morph into things like flying saucers and orbs that float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing \"P\" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game. There are five different screens in the game, each featuring a distinct scheme of platforms (the fifth has no platforms at all).

This reduction method can be used up to six times before Hayley refuses to help Eric any more. \n \nElements added in Back to Skool include stink bombs (used to trigger the opening of windows), water pistols, mice that can be released in the girls' school causing widespread panic, and sherry (which can be squirted into cups and used to \"intoxicate\" teachers by splashing it on them with correct timing).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ichjfcmole9n7cmt54tx.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":26418,"name":"Batalyx","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Five different games and an interactive pause mode form this psychedelic, multi-part experience created by Jeff Minter.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7vy8.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26417,"name":"Shadow of the Unicorn","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vjvdc3e3ygocw7qimkpj.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":26416,"name":"Space Hunter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/i73rvegdphjxknxkh84t.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26415,"name":"The Human Race","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qvuuy3tdx77kqa8jscij.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26357,"name":"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sue Townsend created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager.

It was first released in the United Kingdom for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Atari 8-bit home computers in 1985. It was later released in France by ERE Informatique in 1986, and was released in the United States by Datasoft later that year. It was also ported to the Tatung Einstein home computer in 1989, exclusively in the United Kingdom. It is the fifth instalment of the Strategic Wargames series. \n \nThe game is set during a fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, in which both sides use nuclear and chemical weapons against each other. The main objective of the game is to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code. \n \nDuring development, the developers obtained extensive information and statistics of military strength from the Ministry of Defence and the Soviet embassy in London. Theatre Europe gained national controversy upon release, receiving criticism from both the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and The Sun newspaper. Some high street retail chains refused to sell the game upon release. Despite the controversy, the game received critical acclaim from reviewers. Praise was directed at its accuracy, playability and value for money. It won the \"Best Strategy Game\" award at the 1985 Golden Joystick Awards and was nominated for the \"Game of the Year\" title.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dgdff3iuxu9sg4apbqg5.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26301,"name":"Zoids","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Seminal C64 game based on the Robot Toy franchise","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/p3qmg8sbhmy4y0bxeixf.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26289,"name":"Battalion Commander","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tdgalcgkgastmzxiz7ad.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":26286,"name":"U.S.A.A.F. - United States Army Air Force","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/d3syy4bucczssmrbggk4.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"}]},{"id":26283,"name":"Who Dares Wins II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system.

The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off.\n\nThe aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix.\n\nTo start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time. Also storms which the aircraft can not pass through show up and some aircraft have very little fuel and have to land fast or they will crash.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co74hg.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":25900,"name":"Kampfgruppe","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Turn-based strategic war game set during WWII on the Eastern front.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/a91a5ut2ukpdz74rmdqj.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":25898,"name":"By Fire & Sword","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Set in the 1600s, Fire and the Sword brings the medieval Mount and Blade games into an era of new technology and conflicts, while retaining its open world RPG gameplay.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vetxvuvszz3cofiog5gx.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":25890,"name":"Inca","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You try to find your friend Dr. Paul Jamison, who disappeared mysteriously in the deep jungles of Peru while he tried to unearth the last secrets of the Inca.

A key strategic element to the game is for the player character to travel several screens ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path for it; normally this would be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion. However, if the bomb is left in an unsafe location, it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without the player character being destroyed once.

Find the tomb and you will stand to be the sole beneficiary to Primm’s estate. The only information that you have to go by is Primm’s unpublished paper on the legend of Ahnk-Ahnk and his African diary.\n\nThe quest begins near a large port town and here you can find stores which will allow you to purchase items which are necessary like ropes and shovels. You start the quest with only $250. Use the map provided to find important landmarks and locations which the natives may name when giving you directions. The natives hold the key to your success. Not all natives behave the same to strangers. Offer them gold, copper, or other gifts to win their friendship. But be careful, not all natives see your offering as a sign of friendship. They each have their own cultures. Presenting them with the wrong gift may hinder your attempts to get needed information.\n\nUse the joystick to move about, press the fire button when you are standing still to move control to the four icons to the left of the exploration window. Click these icons for further options. The diary icon lets you page through your diary to review the clues that you get from the native chiefs. The map icon lets you see what you have explored so far. The options icon offers three choices. Two let you check on your location and condition. The third lets you drop things off to form a cache. The hand icon lets you select what you have in your hand and it lets you use items from your backpack. If you are delirious, your joystick control will become uncertain, reversed or randomized.\n\nGo to a pub in a port city to save your game. You can save up to 10 different games at once on a single disk. Each time that you start a new game, the location of the tomb and other valuables is subject to change.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5wcc.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":13866,"name":"Gyroscope","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gyroscope is based on the Atari arcade game Marble Madness, the gameplay is very similar except the player controls a spinning gyroscope rather than a marble.
