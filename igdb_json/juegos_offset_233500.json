In this 2D mobile game, you play as a brave strawberry that has been kidnapped and locked in a cage. You have no choice but to fight for your survival by battling one vegetable per day on sugar islands.\nEach battle takes place on an island made of sugar blocks that can be destroyed by either you or your enemy. As you destroy the blocks, the island gets smaller and it becomes easier to fall off. Falling off the island means falling into the cave where a worm is waiting with a plate to eat the loser of the game.\nTo survive the day, you must knock down the vegetable off the island before the vegetable knocks you down. You can use your gun to shoot at the enemy, knocking them back. But that's not all - each character, whether it be the strawberry or the vegetable, has a unique superpower that can be used during the battle. These superpowers are much stronger than getting knocked back by a gun, and they can be the key to your survival!\nWith each passing day, the battles get harder, and the vegetables become stronger. Can you survive the challenge and become the ultimate Fruit Battle champion? You'll have to rely on your skills, wits, and strategic use of your superpowers to come out on top.\nBut it's not just about surviving. \"Fruit Battle - Survival\" features cute and colorful graphics that will keep you entertained for hours on end.
