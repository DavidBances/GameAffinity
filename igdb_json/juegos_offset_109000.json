Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal.

The twelve numbers engraved on the Chronos Gauge are the key to victory!\n\nVedley, who lost his parents in a sad incident, hears from Achieitz about the existence of the Letoiles, who are able to make any wish come true.\nIn order to turn back time and try to save his parents, Vedley makes a pact with a Letoile and becomes her Maschelle, and they throw themselves into the battles to steal Sertzes from the other Letoiles.\n\nControl time, baffle enemies, and turn the course of battles! After all the ferocious fighting... What awaits Vedley?\n\nSkill Gems have many different powers, and when fitted into a Skill Plate, a Gem makes it possible for a character to use magic or a skill.\nBy combining Gems, characters may also be able to use special skills.\nAlso, by flicking a Skill Plate, it can be rotated, and it is easy to change the positions of skills already fitted directly corresponding to the Chronos Gauge.\n\nThe outcome of every battle comes down to the tactics you choose!\nDuring battles, the character icons are shown on the left-hand side of the screen, and next to them, a range of effects are sometimes displayed.\nThese are known as Field Effects, and if a character’s turn comes while one of those effects is shown next to their icon, the character can gain the benefits of that effect.\nHowever, Field Effects are not always advantageous. There are also disadvantageous effects. Also, effects apply to apply to both enemies and allies. However, by raising the level of the Chronos Gauge to 100% or more, you can launch Interrupt Actions. When an advantageous effect is attached to an enemy, or when a disadvantageous effect is attached to an ally, you can use an Interrupt Action to change the order of the characters' actions, and avoid these unfavorable situations.\n\nThe Chronos Gauge holds the key to victory!\nThe Chronos Gauge is necessary for characters to be able to use the Particular Skills they each have, or to be able to launch Interrupt Actions, with which the order of the characters' actions can be changed. The Gauge has a display like a clock, with the numbers 1 to 12, and at the start of a battle one of the numbers will glow. The glowing number will move clockwise each time an ally or enemy performs an action. At this time, if you use a skill corresponding to the glowing number, a Just Time Bonus will be triggered, and the level of the Gauge will recover by a large amount. Also, the level of the Gauge increases, although only by a little, when enemies are defeated.\n\nThe Gauge is shared across all party members, so it's a good idea to pay attention to the level as you use Particular Skills and launch Interrupt Actions!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7hc9.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kemco","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Magitec","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"}]},{"id":118167,"name":"Tennis World Tour: Roland-Garros Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Players can step into the shoes of Rafael Nadal, 11-time winner of Roland-Garros, and Kristina Mladenovic, a French player ranked amongst the top 50 in the world, for matches on the clay courts of Roland-Garros.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":118168,"name":"Museum of Other Realities","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An immersive art showcase in VR, the Museum of Other Realities is a space to connect, share, and experience virtual reality art with others.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3pg3.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MOR Museum Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":118169,"name":"Himno 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":118170,"name":"The Things We Lost in the Flood","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The world's dampest and least efficient chat room.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6g46.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Awkward Silence Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":118171,"name":"Missed Messages.","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"‘goth gf’s iPhone’ airdrops you - accept or decline?\nA romance/horror story about life, death, and memes.\nA shift in perspective can change everything.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co28l8.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Angela He","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Zephyo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":118172,"name":"The Interlude","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In over your head with no easy way out, you find yourself stuck in the parking lot nervously awaiting your fate.
