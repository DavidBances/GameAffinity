Dr. Robotnik (AKA Eggman) is yet again up to his no good tricks. Factories and pollution are spreading like wildfire as he's once again trying to take over the world. Fortunately, the Sonic Heroes are never at rest, and once again wage their battle to defeat Eggman's evil forces.\n\nHowever, the heroes have landed in double jeopardy. Eggman's madman descendant, Eggman Nega, has escaped from the Ifrit's dimension, and is wreaking his usual havoc in an effort to destroy the world. He's even captured Eggman's top three lieutenants, the ruthless Team Metallix, and reprogrammed them to do his even more evil bidding.\n\nUnlike previous instances of Nega's destruction, Eggman is not fazed. He figures that once he's in control of the world, he can take care of Eggman Nega as he pleases. Unfortunately for Eggman, Sonic the Hedgehog isn't having that. Before he can decide who to dispatch where, he receives a call through the communicator Tails gave him. The message: someone's already on the case. Not just someone, but someones!\n\nApparently, Sonic's very own sister, Sonia the Hedgehog has already caught wind of Nega's evil and is out to stop him. Sonic is a bit eased, knowing full well of his sister's strength and agility. She also lets him know that she has found and teamed up with a mysterious young hedgehog who can move things with his mind. Sonic instantly recognizes that Sonia is with his newest ally: Silver the Hedgehog. Silver has once again traveled through time to ensure that the future is free of Nega's tampering (though he really ought to just stay here in the present, you know). Knowing that the two hedgehogs are more than capable of handling the situation, Sonic leaves it to them, and resumes dealing with Eggman.\n\nEggman Nega is well aware that Sonic is busy with his dimwitted ancestor. However, he'd do best not to overlook a certain factor. The S Factor, Sonia and Silver! It's up to you to lead the unlikely tag team of the physically powerful Sonia, and the psychokinetic Silver on their quest to right the wrongs of the evil Eggman Nega!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4s0p.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Aquaslash","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sonic Retro","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"}]},{"id":6134,"name":"Valdis Story: Abyssal City","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a side scrolling exploration platformer with an emphasis on intricate and rewarding combat as well as deep play style customization.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co223r.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Endlessfluff Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":128821,"name":"Eternal Alien","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"diving into pits, hoping for the best, kissing your loved ones, betting it all on a slight chance…","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":83912,"name":"Skip-Bo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Skip-Bo, the popular family card game, officially licensed by Mattel, is now in the App Store!

The objective of the game is to investigate the mines underneath the old Western town Tumbleton in order to unearth the secrets lurking below. The player controls Rusty who is equipped with a pickaxe but the player is given options to upgrade the tools used for digging as progression is made in the game. Besides health, the player also needs coal for light, and water for special abilities.\nSteamWorld Dig has platform elements in that the player runs, jumps and encounter foes, but the main objective is mining. That means that the player builds – or rather deconstructs – the game world and creates platforms that way. The player collects resources and other hidden resources which can be brought back to the surface and exchanged for cash. When the player progress in the game new abilities are unlocked. Each playthrough, the mines are randomized, making items and treasure appear in different locations. If the player gets stuck there is a self destruct function, but the players can also buy ladders in the store at the surface to get out of tricky situations.\nWhen progressing deeper down in the cave, the player encounters various enemies with different attack patterns and weak spots. The game features multiple worlds, each with a completely different environment. Dying results in a reparation penalty fee, and the player respawns back on the surface. All the loot that has been accumulated when the player dies can be picked up again.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/v1jtxva0er1d25ui0o8p.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Image & Form","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"},{"id":0,"name":"Google Stadia"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1334,"name":"Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Brothers is presented from a third-person view overlooking the two brothers.
