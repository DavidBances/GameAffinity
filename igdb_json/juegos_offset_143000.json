GalCiv II focuses on the single player experience that consists of a Campaign mode and a \"Sandbox\" mode, and omits multi-player. The game is notable for its artificial intelligence, which is challenging without being given resources and abilities not available to the player, as is common in the majority of strategy games.\n\nGalactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar is the first expansion pack to the turn-based strategy game Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords. It added new features such as: Two new civilizations: a genocidal Drengin offshoot called the Korath and a civilization called the Krynn, A new campaign in which the player leads the Drengin Empire, The ability to create custom opponents, An \"environment\" statistic to planets, which will determine which civilization can innately colonize or what technologies will be necessary for other civilizations to colonize different planets, An enhanced role for espionage, special \"Agents\" being hired that can conduct various missions, such as sabotage or destabilization, on rival worlds, or act as counter-agents against rival agents attempting to conduct missions on the player's worlds, Asteroid fields to the space map, for players to mine for resources.
