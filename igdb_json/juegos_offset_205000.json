This is a different port than the title \"Darius+\", which was published by The Edge and developed by Softek for the Amiga, Atart ST, and ZX Spectrum.\n\nAmidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\n\nYes, fish.\n\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\n\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\n\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\n\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\n\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\n\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\n\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:\n- Darius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\n\n- Darius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\n\n- Super Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a \"boss rush\" mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xwp.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"},{"id":0,"name":"PC Engine SuperGrafx"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":39882,"name":"Bostilda","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A.B.

The snowball will re-bound off walls, until eventually shattering against a wall. Any enemies the snowball rolls into are eliminated and other stationary snowballs start rolling when the rolling snowball touches them.

The game is similar to other robot/mech games by Masaya/NSC, such as Vixen 357 on Sega Mega Drive.At the end of the 24th century, humanity recovered from a devastative World War and humans started to colonize the galaxy. In 2384, unknown invaders attack the Jupiter base and finally reach Earth. Although the Earth Federation has prepared a counter offensive, the chances of success are very slim. But the Asian Federation has a secret weapon, the SERD Squadron, and its mission is to find and destroy the invader’s bases and drive them out of Earth. Hiso Kihei Serd is a turn based war game at its core and in any given mission the player must deploy and control a number of Serd giant robots on an overhead map – each mech comes with its own characteristics, some are fast and have long-range attacks whereas others are bulkier, slower but use more powerful weaponry. When a fight between two opponents is triggered, the screen switches to an animated sequence. Each Serd gains experience in battle which may be used to enhance its attack and evasive capabilities. However, should one of the Serd be destroyed during a given mission, it is gone for good but more (up to seven) can be acquired as the game progresses. Hiso Kihei Serd consists of ten missions and is single player only. A password system also allows the player to save his progress (although the backup RAM can also be used).\n\nIt is important to remember that some units possess a special ability, many of which can easily turn the tide of the battle. Using them wisely is a key to quick victory in later stages. Overall, this is an enjoyable game, and a prequel to Vixen 357. One can easily notice the similarities between these 2 games, and it’s easy to pick up one if you’ve ever played the other one at some point.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6xfj.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":48117,"name":"To the Earth","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet!

Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first \"ecosim\", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject.\n\nSim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems.\n\nContrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success.\n\nBalance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load \"biased\" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5xjn.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50494,"name":"War of the Lance","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"War of the Lance is presented in a top-down view.

The Road Runner can earn points for eating the birdseed and also by making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc. The Atari 2600 version has a difference from the other versions, in that the Road Runner isn't required to eat the birdseed but can do so for the points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mp9.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":274889,"name":"Bubblegum Crisis: Crime Wave","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A game for PC-88 & 98, set in Megatokyo and featuring Knight Sabers as the main characters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7bb0.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":274842,"name":"Coke","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Developed by Swift Software and released in 1989, the goal is to shoot Coke cans to score points before the \"Thirst\" counter reaches 9.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7baq.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":274079,"name":"The NewZealand Story","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7alg.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":274078,"name":"The NewZealand Story","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7alf.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":274077,"name":"The NewZealand Story","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ald.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":274076,"name":"The NewZealand Story","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7alc.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":274072,"name":"The NewZealand Story","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7al6.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":273849,"name":"Galaxy Force","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"CAUTION: FOUR MEGA POWER!
