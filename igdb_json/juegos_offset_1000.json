The narrative revolves around Kratos, the protagonist from earlier instalments, who was once a loyal servant of the God of War, Ares. Tricked by Ares into unknowingly murdering his own family, Kratos breaks the blood oath binding him to Ares and abandons his former master. Subsequently, Kratos finds himself imprisoned and must navigate a path to freedom, severing the bond between him and Ares.\n\nThe game retains the familiar hack-and-slash combat system of its predecessors, featuring Kratos wielding the Blades of Chaos. However, a new addition, the World Weapon system, allows Kratos to wield various weapons. Additionally, Kratos can now acquire up to four magical disciplines—Fires of Ares, Ice of Poseidon, Lightning of Zeus, and Soul of Hades—each bestowing unique abilities and imbuing his weapon with magic. For instance, the Ice of Poseidon enables underwater breathing. Rage, a recurring feature, undergoes modifications; it accumulates through attacks, and when the bar is full, it automatically unleashes until the player ceases attacking or sustains damage. Three new relics provide Kratos with the ability to manipulate time, create a \"shadow\" self, and dispel illusions crafted by his guardians.\n\nNotably, God of War: Ascension introduces online multiplayer to the series. Players, before engaging in multiplayer battles, align with one of four gods—Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon—each offering a distinct set of abilities. As players accumulate experience and level up their warriors, they unlock magical abilities, armour, weapons, relics, and other treasures.

As the title suggests, a large portion of the game consists of stealth, staking out targets and firing sniper rifles. Bullet trajectories are subject to wind, gravity and flight time, all of which players must account for when taking shots. To simplify this procedure, easier difficulty settings contain indicators that highlight enemies and show precisely where a bullet will hit.\n\nThe main weapons used in the game are silenced pistols, knives and various types of sniper rifles. In missions that are played with characters who are not snipers, the stealth aspect is dropped in favor of faster-paced \"run and gun\" scenarios. An exception to this are spotting missions, in which the primary objective consists of marking targets for a computer-controlled sniper character.\n\nMost of the game takes place in a dense jungle environment. Waypoint overlays at all times display the correct routes through the areas players must traverse. While these routes need not be followed exactly, the level design usually ensures an overall linear path due to obstacle placement and invisible walls. Many waypoints trigger scripted mission events, and some waypoints act as checkpoints, which automatically save the game.\n\nThe single player campaign of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is made up of four separate acts, each of which deals with a different conflict. All acts are split up into various missions, which usually depict the same event from different points of view. For example, in one segment players may be participating in an infantry assault on an enemy camp, while the next segment has them assuming the role of a supporting sniper who backs up the assault. There is downloadable content available for the title that seamlessly continues the story line with three additional campaign missions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e42.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CyberFront","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"City Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1368,"name":"Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform, first-person, modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience.

The gameplay of DOA2, and all subsequent Dead or Alive games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds.The other defining feature of DOA2, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. In DOA2 many attacks upon hitting will inflict a stun on the opponent. While stunned, the opponent cannot attack, and cannot guard, but they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6t3o.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team NINJA","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":1389,"name":"Dead or Alive 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dead or Alive 3 is the third installment in the popular fighting series Dead or Alive.

Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ove.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix Product Development Division 6","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":1504,"name":"Front Mission 2089","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Front Mission 2089 is a tactical role-playing game developed by Square Enix Co., Ltd., MSF, and Winds, and was published and released in Japan by Square Enix Co., Ltd. in 2005 and 2008 for the mobile phones.
