It introduced real-time combat, sci-fi elements, a persistent open world with day-night cycle, and survival mechanics. This was a precursor to Falcom's seminal action RPG franchise, Dragon Slayer.

The title was initially released for the NEC PC-88 and was later ported to other Japanese computers. While exploring the Palenque ruins in southern Mexico, the player takes the role of an archeologist where they use the game's katakana text parser to interact with the world and solve puzzles. The game was technically impressive for its time due to how quickly it could load new images, similar to Falcom's Demons Ring, and for its use of digitized photographs for some of its graphics.\n\nAsteka was most likely released on April 13, 1985 according to early advertisements. However, even Falcom contradicts itself on the title's exact publication date.
