Still, his dream is to get a job at an eroge studio in hopes of creating what he loves, eroge. \n \nTomoya's luck takes a turn for the better when he sees a help wanted ad for the local studio Flower, and after a meeting with the company president (who to his surprise looks like an elementary school kid), manages to get a job as administrator of the company's website. Tomoya's glee at being part of the eroge industry is short-lived, as he soon learns that Flower is on the chopping block due to their first title being a massive failure. \n \nAfter playing through Flower's first title, Tomoya realizes that his co-workers don't know anything about eroge, lacking the insight and understanding needed to make a good game. After some nudging from the president of Flower's parent company and some soul searching of his own, our protagonist takes it upon himself to save Flower by teaching the four girls on staff the ins and outs of what makes an eroge good. The story thus focuses on Tomoya's role as a psuedo-consultant while getting to know the four heroines of the story as the player is given an interesting look at the world of eroge development.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1v9n.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CLOCKUP team.ANISE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HOBIBOX Co., Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CLOCKUP team.ANISE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"AiCherry","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"AiCherry","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MangaGamer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HOBIBOX Co., Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":85301,"name":"Music On: Retro Keyboard","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"“One will be able to perform the soundtrack of the best classic video games how they originally sounded” - said Alberto Gonzalez, producer at Abylight and responsible for over 40 original video game soundtracks since 1989","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co82pp.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":85073,"name":"Date or Ditch","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Think you’re a real Casanova?","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fuvrgis9vlngzlfssrpt.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gameloft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":84584,"name":"24/7 Solitaire","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"24/7 Solitaire features 24 variations of the most well-known and best-loved single-player card game including Klondike, Freecell, Spider, Pyramid, Yukon and 7 versions of Peg-Solitaire.

As the title suggests, a large portion of the game consists of stealth, staking out targets and firing sniper rifles. Bullet trajectories are subject to wind, gravity and flight time, all of which players must account for when taking shots. To simplify this procedure, easier difficulty settings contain indicators that highlight enemies and show precisely where a bullet will hit.\n\nThe main weapons used in the game are silenced pistols, knives and various types of sniper rifles. In missions that are played with characters who are not snipers, the stealth aspect is dropped in favor of faster-paced \"run and gun\" scenarios. An exception to this are spotting missions, in which the primary objective consists of marking targets for a computer-controlled sniper character.\n\nMost of the game takes place in a dense jungle environment. Waypoint overlays at all times display the correct routes through the areas players must traverse. While these routes need not be followed exactly, the level design usually ensures an overall linear path due to obstacle placement and invisible walls. Many waypoints trigger scripted mission events, and some waypoints act as checkpoints, which automatically save the game.\n\nThe single player campaign of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is made up of four separate acts, each of which deals with a different conflict. All acts are split up into various missions, which usually depict the same event from different points of view. For example, in one segment players may be participating in an infantry assault on an enemy camp, while the next segment has them assuming the role of a supporting sniper who backs up the assault. There is downloadable content available for the title that seamlessly continues the story line with three additional campaign missions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e42.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"City Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CyberFront","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":261294,"name":"Sonic Golf DX","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sonic Golf DX is a mobile phone game released as part of the Puyo Puyo!

Following the withdrawal from the Madrid area of the combined armies of Great Britain, Portugal and Spain after the Battle of Talavera in July 1809, Viscount Wellington retreated into Portugal and consolidated his forces. Now Napoleon’s Armée d'Espagne, has invaded Portugal once again but thus far the network of entrenchments has proved impossible for the French to successfully assail. \n \nWellington has planned a fresh offensive to drive the invaders out of Portugal and eventually out of the Peninsula altogether. Although forced back to the edges of their Peninsula by France and the traitors who helped them, Spain is not yet out of the fight. The Supreme Central Junta and its successor the Supreme Regency authorised the forming of local bands to fight guerrilla - the “little war” - against the invaders. \nChoose one of the three nations involved - France, Great Britain or Spain - and experience one the most intense conflict of the Napoleonic era.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zb8wnqblzwkswarqupye.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"The Creative Assembly","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Feral Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":66660,"name":"Densha de GO!

Although the Battle of the Bulge is ground that has been visited by wargamers before, it has never been done with this level of fidelity and historical accuracy. The most advanced and realistic model of command decision-making implemented to date in a commercial wargame, combined with thorough historical research on the battlefields and forces involved in this campaign sets Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge apart from the competition. \n \nSet during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge, Command Ops lets gamers assess, plan, order and react at the operational level just like a real Corps, Division and Brigade commander. Hundreds of hours of gameplay await armchair generals who will be challenged to fight their way across 27 scenarios that stretch from the initial German surprise offensive to the powerful Allied counter-attack. \n \nCommand Ops: Battles from the Bulge also sports some of the most advanced and impressive AI ever devised in an operational-level wargame! It is your choice whether to manage every detail of your army, or have the friendly AI manage the war on a lower level while you plan the larger scale maneuvers designed to make short work of your enemy. Just as a historical commander, you can choose where you need to step in and when you need to stand back and let your subordinates do their jobs. \n \nThe enemy AI will use its skill to launch well-timed and coordinated strikes as it probes your lines for weakness while realistically reacting to your movements! In addition, for the enthusiastic mod community awaiting Command Ops, powerful tools like MapMaker and ScenMaker allow for the creation of maps and scenarios further adding to already near limitless replayability.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/g08bkbpwvwljmtmm1x9q.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Matrix Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Panther Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":16167,"name":"Voodoo Dice","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Roll the dice in a mystical world filled with exploration, puzzle-solving, and adventure!
