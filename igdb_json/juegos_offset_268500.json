The game was developed for the multi-user interactive computer-based education PLATO system and programmed in the TUTOR programming language and utilized scalable vector graphics called linesets. A 1977 development of Panther, with more refined graphics, was named Panzer.\n\nThe game features team-based deathmatch. There are two teams, Squares and Triangles. The object of the game is to destroy the opposing team's base. Game play is straightforward; the player selects a pseudonym and a team, traverse the terrain looking for enemies to destroy on the way to their base. Perspective is maintained by the use of scalable vector graphics and visual interest is enhanced with special graphics for explosions using a custom character set to accomplish limited raster graphics animation.\n\nWhen players enter the game their tanks are placed randomly in the playing arena near their bases and are temporarily camouflaged to allow time to orient themselves with the current map and state of play. The initial view of the game is in \"on-board\" mode, which is a first-person perspective of the arena. The other main view available is the map which shows the 5 mountains (Crag, Nixon, Og, Pathos, and Red) which vary in size and placement each time a new game is started. On the map view players can see all of their team members positions and can see enemies only when they are within range. Messaging between team members is available and broadcast-style messages (insults) to the opposing team are also allowed. Team coordination and cooperation is critical to winning in this game as each player has different skills, some players are better at hunting down and killing enemies (or at least engaging and distracting them), others are good at hiding and sneaking to the opposing base to begin bombardment. An interesting capability of the game is that players can donate ammunition and fuel to other players in order to facilitate their role in the game. Ammunition and fuel are loaded at the player's base.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7w06.jpg","releaseYear":1975,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PLATO"}]},{"id":291107,"name":"Idle Champions: Spelljammer Regis Skin & Feat Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this pack: Unlocks the Champion Regis (if you don't already own them) Spelljammer Regis Skin An Epic Feat for Regis 7 Gold Regis Chests 1 Guaranteed Shiny Equipment Card 6 Epic Blacksmithing Contracts 6 Epic Bounty Contracts","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Codename Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":291108,"name":"Idle Champions: Spelljammer Pilot Briv Skin & Feat Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this pack: Unlocks the Champion Briv (if you don't already own them) Spelljammer Pilot Briv Skin An Epic Feat for Briv 7 Gold Briv Chests 1 Guaranteed Shiny Equipment Card 6 Epic Blacksmithing Contracts 6 Epic Bounty Contracts","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Codename Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":291109,"name":"Squad: Weapon Skins - Jungle Assault Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Weapon skins are cosmetic items grounded in reality that don't impact gameplay.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":291110,"name":"RealFlight Evolution: ViperJet","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This detailed scale model of the ViperJet has a 3.5m wingspan and is powered by a turbine engine.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":291111,"name":"RealFlight Evolution: Tower Hobbies ASW-28","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The ASW 28 2.0m electric sailplane is one of the most maneuverable, highest-performance gliders from Tower Hobbies.
