This package includes an AI module that modifies livestock DNA to generate edible lifeforms that area ideal to the planet conditions allowing you to focus efforts on terraforming and construction. Your settlement progress has been spectacular, and although you're nearing retirement, you've managed to expand the colony from its meager initial size of 100 adult citizens in a valley, to over 1,000 residents of all ages spread over several outposts during your tenure. \n \nUnfortunately, the 'Sustenance and Nutrient Generator' you were given seems to be malfunctioning, as the animals being created have recently exhibited violent behaviour and are now chasing down your people as they flee to the founding settlement. You need to set up defenses to slow the tide of violent animals, while you begin a search for a lasting solution. \n \nThis game is a unique fusion of tower defense strategy and visual novel, with branching dialogue and four different endings. As you play, the AI uses machine learning to discover what offense is the best against specific defenses. It takes into account the pathing, water hazards, and even the genetics of the animals which it controls indirectly by selecting the best specimens from its own evolving evaluation.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nie18l93l34wyo0bowdj.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cabrill Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":96274,"name":"Autocross Madness","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Time to tour the world!\nDrive trough beautiful landscapes and go mad into curves or just be a Sunday driver.\nChallenge yourself in driving like a mad man as you try to get to the finish line as fast as possible.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ckuzyjesvsyvg8fvlr0l.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DCGsoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":96170,"name":"Pirates: All Aboard!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sea is calling...pick a ship, bring friends and sail on!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8vaf.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"QubicGames S.A.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Qubic Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"No Gravity Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":95625,"name":"Who's in the Box?","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"What can be so strange about a simple wooden box?
