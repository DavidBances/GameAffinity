It is the first in a series of four Nazoler games.\n\nNazoler Land Soukan-gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off.\n\nNazoler Land Soukan-gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are:\n\nRotation Maze\nA maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze.\n\nNazoler Fortune-Telling\nDespite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star).\n\nSuper Jigsaw\nIn this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge.\n\nSave Princess Momoko!\nPromoted as the \"major feature\", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error.\n\nJapan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz\nA quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it.\n\nFamicom Reaction Test\nIn this simple \"game\", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel.\n\nExtrusion Puzzle\nSimilar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once.\n\n3D Maze\nA simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance. The goal is to simply find the way out.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sbfmcq4n0rie86fd33n4.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer Disk System"}]},{"id":41399,"name":"Nazoler Land Dai 3-gou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The third and final core entry in the Nazoler Land series of minigame compilations with a magazine theme.

Like its predecessors, it was developed and published by Sunsoft for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System in Japan only, and contains various minigames with diverse gameplay.\n\nThese minigames include:\n\nSugoro Quiz\nAll three Nazoler games had a quiz minigame of some kind, but Sugoro Quiz is the first to emphasize a multiplayer aspect. Two to four human players compete in a board game in which players progress by answering trivia questions.\n\nTomo Bakuso\nThe second minigame starring the schoolgirl Tomo, after Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Blast Tomo. In this game, she is trying to pass through a level of platforms, some of which will block access after being passed through a certain number of times.\n\nTanteidan Boy Nazoler\nAn early example of an \"escape the room\" adventure game, which would become very popular in browser flash games and games like 999. The player must use the items in the room they are trapped in by clicking on items strewn around it and discover the exit. As the player interacts with the room it visibly changes.\n\nBingo\nNot so much a game but a Bingo simulator. Two to four players can generate a unique bingo card and the game will randomly select numbers. The first player to finish their card wins the game.\n\nNazoler BOX\nAs with Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Nazoler BOX, this isn't so much a minigame as a response to letters sent to SunSoft about the Nazoler Land series. Tomo, from Tomo Bakuso, answers user mail. Kirk, the protagonist of SunSoft's Dead Zone, makes a cameo appearance.\n\nNazoler BOX Contest Results\nIn Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Nazoler BOX there was a way to create pixel art which users could then print out and enter into a contest. This minigame simply comments on the various entries that SunSoft received. It is hosted by cameo characters from Dead Zone and Ripple Island.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hcfjfe0y1yuirwbgusob.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer Disk System"}]},{"id":41400,"name":"Nazoler Land Dai 2-gou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second game in the Nazoler Land series of minigame compilations published by SunSoft for the Famicom Disk System.\n\nNazoler Land Dai-2-gou is the sequel to Nazoler Land Soukan-gou and is similarly a minigame connection with a magazine theme. It contains six minigames, rather than its predecessor's eight. A notable feature of this compilation is that all the minigames are represented as Famicom disks on the select screen, and once a game is chosen an animation shows the disk being loaded in the Famicom Disk System.\n\nThe minigames include:\n\nPatalick\nA panel-switching puzzle game that shares some similarities with Q*Bert (specifically, switching panel colors and the isometric perspective) but is far more cerebral and less active in nature. The goal is to use the shape-shifting protagonist (who transforms from an angel to a devil form) to switch all the panels on the screen to the same color, keeping in mind that every panel in a horizontal and vertical line will flip over.\n\nGeographic Nazoler Quiz\nLike the transportation quiz from the first Nazoler Land, this is a quiz game with a geographical theme. Rather than crossing over Japan in various types of transport, the goal is to travel the world and answer questions on different countries. Answering enough questions correctly allows the player to buy a ticket to the next location and progress forward.\n\nStraw Pistil\nA gambling game in which the player barters against AI opponents for money. The opponents are unpredictable, so the game is largely based on luck.\n\nBlast Tomo\nAs with \"Save Princess Momoko\" from Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or the Cheetahmen from Action 52), Blast Tomo is the \"major feature\" of the compilation. The goal is to help a schoolgirl, Tomo, reach the bottom of a stage with the strategic placing of a finite number of bombs to destroy blocks in the way. The player must also not any let mice touch Tomo on the way down.\n\nNazoler Boys' Detective Club\nA parody of Famicom Tantei Club, the player is the leader of a detective club currently investigating a mansion supposedly hiding incriminating evidence. Should the player make too many wrong decisions while exploring, the rest of the group will stop listening to them.\n\nNazoler BOX\nNot so much a game as a more overtly magazine section where an animated character (Tomo, from Blast Tomo) reads mail from players of the previous game as well as discuss promotional features of the Nazoler Land series. There's also a section where players can draw their own images, as part of a contest for Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xsjuagzddyy2i0gepx5l.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SUNSOFT","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer Disk System"}]},{"id":41401,"name":"Nankin no Adventure","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Famicom Disk System adventure game developed by Sunsoft in 1988.\n\nNankin no Adventure is a Famicom Disk System adventure game from SunSoft that plays much like every other Famicom adventure game of the era.

These were not high priorities since the original versions continued to sell well. In 1982, when the Keyboard Component was killed, Marketing wanted to produce a series of Super Sports cartridges for the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) to help push that system, so work was ordered halted on the non-ECS sports games. \n \nFUN FACT: INTV Corporation released the game as is, including the fatal bug and the debugging module. The game occasionally crashes, displaying the debugging screen. To explain this, INTV added the following notice to the instruction book: \n \nBaseball II, however, was a favorite of baseball-fanatic Mike Minkoff (Snafu). The game had been essentially completed, but regularly crashed, despite weeks of debugging at APh. Mattel didn't want to put any more resources into the game, but Mike, although now a Director in charge of Intellivision, Aquarius and M Network development, volunteered to debug the game himself after hours. Since the game had already been announced in several catalogs and press releases (as All-Star Major League Baseball), Mattel kept the title on the schedule and let Mike work on it, on and off as he had time, throughout 1983. \n \nMike managed to clean most of the bugs out of the game, but the cause of one occasional crash eluded him. He linked in a debugging module written by Rick Koenig (Motocross) that displayed the contents of registers and status words on screen when a game halted. Mike was still trying to trace the problem when, in January 1984, Mattel Electronics was closed. \n \nINTV Corporation ultimately released the game; it first appears in their Spring 1986 catalog. They were able to use packaging and instructions already completed for the game at Mattel, with the change of the name to World Championship Baseball so that they wouldn't have to pay for the Major League trademark.

Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a \"specialty\" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release.

This began his lifelong fascination with video games and computers. Even though the family had an Atari 2600, Ryan and his brothers were drawn to the Intellivision and its more complex games. \n \nBy 1992, the family Intellivision had long since died, but Ryan started to discover that thrift stores and garage sales were loaded with old video games. For little money, he was able to build what a decade earlier would've been the video game collection of any kid's dreams. Ryan had become an Intellivision fanatic again. \n \nAs we rolled into the new millennium, the feasibility of programming the Intellivision became possible. A handful of individuals managed to create compilers, emulators, documentation, and development hardware of the Intellivision. Ryan's attention was peaked in 2000 when Joe Zbiciak programmed an entirely new game, 4-Tris, and then managed to build and sell it as a complete package. \n \nIn 2002 Ryan found a lot of spare time to start dabbling with Intellivision programming. After experimenting with a variety of \"Hello World\" programs and learning the various features of the Intellivision one by one, Ryan adopted a Minesweeper clone as the theme of his first full game attempt. \n \nRyan chose to do MineHunter for the following reasons: \n \n1) MineHunter is a proven concept. Creating an entirely new game concept is always a risky venture and requires a greater investment of time. (This is why you see so many clones of popular games.) \n \n2) MineHunter is not very difficult to program since it requires little or no animation. (This belief changed when Ryan added the explosion routine.) \n \n3) The game concept had always been a favorite of him. Every time he came across it, he would find himself addicted again. \n \n4) MineHunter is well suited for the Intellivision's display capabilities. MindStrike for the Intellivision ECS proved that it's feasible to make a screen full of numbers look good. \n \n \nThe majority of MineHunter was programmed over the course of about 9 months from mid 2002 to early 2003. The game was about 95% finished when suddenly all of Ryan's free time had disappeared. In addition, his interest in programming the Intellivision was starting to wane due to realization that it may be impossible to ever build and sell games. Some brief research showed Ryan that building actual cartridges and producing the associated manuals, boxes, and overlays would be insanely expensive and require an immense amount of time. \n \nRyan's Intellivision programming work was falling farther and farther to the backburner when in late 2003 he was approached by the Chris Neiman and David Harley about the possibility of making MineHunter into an actual cartridge. Over 2003 and 2004 they put a lot of effort, research and investment into working out a plan that would allow for the production of new games to be published just like the originals were 20 years ago. Their efforts encouraged him to complete the programming of MineHunter in 2004.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1pid.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Intellivision"}]},{"id":41473,"name":"Land Battle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"[Unreleased 1982] Land Battle is a two player war game which utilizes both strategic and tactical modes of play.

Only USCF Chess had been approved for onboard RAM, an expensive proposition.\n\nWhen the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) was given the green light, Gabriel Baum, VP of Applications Software, proposed changing Land Battle to an ECS title; the ECS had an additional 2K of RAM available for cartridges. Marketing resisted this -- they still wanted Land Battle as a stand-alone game. Peggi Decarli was assigned to give the game a graphics makeover.\n\nAfter the makeover, Marketing still didn't find it visually interesting enough. By that time, wargame fanatic Steve Sents, having completed Deadly Discs, had started work on an ECS wargame called Desert Fox, which Marketing liked the looks of better. The decision was made to kill Land Battle and incorporate as much of its gameplay and programming as possible into the Desert Fox design.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ph2.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mattel","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Intellivision"}]},{"id":41474,"name":"King of the Mountain","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Head up the mountain, avoiding bears, boulders and inclement weather.

They were a happy couple but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole. \n \nPentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor's palace and rescuing his sweetheart. \n \nThey lived happily together for a while, far from the realms of the Emperor. But he had not had his final say. His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin. He was hoping that Pentaro's own desperation, far from his beloved and unable to escape, would become a punishment worse than death. \n \nHis cruelty knew no bounds. But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him. After overcoming numerous hazards amid the lava caverns, underground passageways and rivers, he managed to escape; not even the raging opposition from the island inhabitants who, fearful of the wrath of the Emperor, tried to keep Pentaro at any price, could hold him. \n \nIt did not take him long to realize that the unknown place from which he had just escaped was actually located on an island, thanks to the map he had gotten during his confinement.

Defeated enemies grant the protagonist experience points; once a certain amount of those is accumulated, the hero levels up and grows stronger.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ntd.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":41707,"name":"Lupin Sansei: Cagliostro no Shiro","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A video game adaption of Hayao Miyazaki's Lupin III anime film of the same name.

Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.\n\n[Personal Reasons For Remembering]\nReally loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/m7mspuzcbcxbddwwx9h7.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Pony Canyon","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Marionette","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX2"}]},{"id":41736,"name":"Shiryou Sensen: War of the Dead","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This horror action RPG revolves around a female SWAT member named Lila who must rescue survivors in an isolated monster-infested town.
