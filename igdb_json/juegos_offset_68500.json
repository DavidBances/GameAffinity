Luckily, you have three types of weapon at your disposal: standard fire, three smart bombs, and by holding down the fire- and smart bomb-keys simultaneously, a laser beam. Certain destroyed ships leave behind three types of power-ups: mint-coloured orbs add 10% energy to your energy bar, green orbs gain 100 points and red orbs gain 200 points.

It is a side-scrolling action game that follows the events depicted in the first television series from Kenshiro's battle against Shin and his gang to his final showdown with Raoh. The game consists of side-scrolling levels where the player must reach the goal while defeating numerous enemy grunts and sub-bosses along the way, each leading to a one-on-one battle with the stage's boss. Despite featuring similar gameplay, this game is unrelated to Toei's video game version of Hokuto no Ken for the Family Computer released a few months later. The game's lead programmer was Yuji Naka, who would later be known for his work on the Sonic the Hedgehog game franchise. Despite appearing on the cover artwork, Rei does not actually appear in this game.\n\nThe original Mark III version game is included along with an enhanced remake in Sega Ages 2500 Hokuto no Ken for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The game was later re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on February 26, 2008. An overseas version of the game was produced for the western Master System titled Black Belt, which lacked the Hokuto no Ken license of the Japanese version and featured altered graphics as a result.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7e7v.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":74158,"name":"Hokuto no Ken","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ecv.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Enix Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"}]},{"id":74159,"name":"Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The next great automotive adventure begins with the Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious standalone expansion for Xbox One and Xbox 360!

Before this can be done however, the continent where the Dark Castle is located must be found. To this end, the player must find five pieces of an ancient map that have been scattered across other continents. Each continent's Lord of the Land might help obtaining a piece of the map, but will request a favour or two in return, and there are other quests to complete on each continent as well. \n \nKing's Bounty 2 was supposed to be split into two parts, with the first concerning the search for the map pieces, and the second would take place on the lost continent. However, apparently only the first part was completed and released to the public. The game had been a free, non-commercial project from the start, so splitting it into parts was not done as a step towards the shareware model, but rather because of free time considerations. \n \nThe game retains many familiar elements from King's Bounty. The player roams the land, buys supplies in towns, hires troops, finds treasure chests, and gets contracts to capture castles in order to earn money and reputation to maintain a large, loyal fighting force. Additionally, the player can buy and sell different goods in towns for a profit, and hire workers to help clear the various terrain obstacles (thus, woodcutters can clear forests, carpenters build bridges over water, stonecutters lay passages through mountains). While there are no player classes in the game, spells can be either found in chests and scrolls, or bought in some of the towns to be used at any time. However, to use magic effectively the player must find a benevolent wizard whose training increases the player's spell power. \n \nThe most common enemies in the game are local feudal lords who are initially neutral to the player but will start chasing and eventually attack when get annoyed by the player's trespassing on their premises. Both the player's and the enemies' armies may consist of a wide variety of creatures, including peasants, mercenaries, soldiers and animals, as well as magical creatures and undead. Each continent has a number of creature dwellings where units can be hired into the player's army. Siege weapons are bought in towns, just like in King's Bounty. Other than direct combat, there are encounters with evil warlocks that can cause trouble for the player, and negative spells in some of the scrolls. \n \nA unique feature of King's Bounty 2 is that it uses a random map generator to create a new world each time it is played. There are four difficulty settings, the first three of which are progressively more difficult \"training\" modes, while the fourth is considered to be the real playing experience. Only the fourth difficulty level was supposed to unlock the lost continent and the final battle with the wizard.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xpgk6hyhq5n6oisup0fj.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":74330,"name":"Elderborn","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Elderborn is a Metal Action Fantasy Slasher with brutal FPP melee combat and souls-like/RPG character progression.
