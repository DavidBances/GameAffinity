The races are divided into three leagues, each one with increasingly harder opponents, and the player needs to regularly upgrade his Lamborghini Diablo in order to keep him above the rest of drivers, by using the money from bets as well as the bonuses obtained when finishing races in the first place.\nThe races themselves take place in a variety of scenarios (mountain roads, the desert, urban settings) and they include weather conditions such as rain and snow. At the end of each league, and in order to be able to join the next one, the player has to go through a \"challenge\", consisting of a timed race in a highway infested with trucks.\n\nDespite the game obtaining mostly positive reviews, a major source of complaints came from the saving system. Players are allowed to save their progress once every four races.

The player mans the advanced attack chopper Dyter-07 to drive them back and rescue scientists on the way. The game has eight levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. For each of the four tropical islands, the surface has to be cleared at first by flying around in a side-scrolling perspective, reminiscent of Choplifter. Alien opposition can be destroyed by shooting them, but after six hits the helicopter gets destroyed. \n \nThe basic goal is to destroy a number of robots which are found by using the radar. However, the chopper is not able to destroy those; that's why it carries the Battledroid, a tank. When the chopper lands, the tank is detached and can be driven over the surface of the island. A side effect of destroying the robots is the rescue of human scientists which are held hostage in said robots. They can be picked up with the helicopter and brought to the base. While this is not required to finish the level, rescued scientists net vital upgrades like better weapons, a better shield or the ability to move underwater. All those upgrades can be either applied to the chopper or the tank. \n \nAfter all robots are destroyed, a volcano opens up and the player moves right in. In the following section the game transforms into a vertically scrolling shooter. Gameplay in these sections is traditional, save for the fact that the player travels downwards from the upper part of the screen: dodging enemy bullets and shooting as many aliens as possible until the level end boss is reached and defeated. An upgraded chopper is important to survive these levels.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/esfnvfr0uo6wyakxtgwe.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":12578,"name":"Dun Darach","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jnxifkkwpcss9ku7xzvy.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gargoyle Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":12579,"name":"Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome to a new world of Danganronpa, and prepare yourself for the biggest, most exhilarating episode yet.

The game's core gameplay revolves around precise shooting, strategic grenade use, and skillful maneuvering to overcome a relentless array of enemies and environmental hazards. Known for its high difficulty level, Exolon challenges players with fast-paced action that demands quick reflexes and careful planning.\n\nWhat sets Exolon apart is its distinctive visual style, which pushed the graphical boundaries of 8-bit computers in its era. The game features detailed sprites and backgrounds that create a unique sci-fi atmosphere, complemented by a pulsing soundtrack that enhances the immersive experience. This combination of challenging gameplay, striking visuals, and atmospheric audio helped Exolon stand out in the late 1980s gaming landscape, earning it a cult following among retro gaming enthusiasts.

The sole purpose for this organization’s existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means helping the current Prime Minister keep ahead of his competition in the polls.\n\nFloor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister's polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or even the player's continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.\n\nDuring the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film \"Capricorn One\"). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.\n\nThe Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting people’s homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it's doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these \"black hat\" activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain \"Mr. Garcia\" (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/figk1uwjdgeffl4kiiio.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":12591,"name":"Fright Night","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based on the 1985 movie of the same name.

To make things even more dull, spacetrucks are fully automated, so it will pilot itself once the proper coordinates are entered.\n\nBut the task does authorize the use of a robot assistant, and coincidentally enough, Floyd, a beloved companion revived at the end of Planetfall, is one of the choices.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5vlw.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Infocom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":12625,"name":"Suspect","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Suspect is an interactive fiction computer game designed by Dave Lebling and published by Infocom in 1984.

It is Infocom's fifteenth game\n\nThe player's character is a reporter for the fictitious newspaper The Washington Representative. Veronica Ashcroft-Wellman, a longtime friend and wealthy socialite, has sent an invitation to the annual Ashcroft Halloween Ball, where Maryland's high society bluebloods rub elbows, network, and congratulate each other on their fortunes. The paper's editor suggests covering the party as a story, smelling an easy article that could either praise or mock the wealthy. Since it is a costume party, the player's character suits up in a rented cowboy outfit and moseys over to the bash. Many attendees wear masks, making it difficult to initially identify them.\n\nNot long into the party, however, Veronica is found dead—strangled with a very familiar-looking lariat, with a bullet from the costume's gunbelt lying near the body for good measure. But the player stashed the rope in the closet earlier, and the bullet is missing from the back of the belt; anyone could have taken them!

Each society's gradual expansion eventually led to an historic meeting in a backwater region of space known as the Spinward Marches.\n\nAlthough their human physical appearances were exactly alike, several fundamental differences existed between the two great powers. The Zhodani's political structure was strictly authoritarian, whereas the Imperium was governed by the rule of the Emperor, a classic aristocracy. As the Zhodani race evolved, the human brain's potential was explored and mastered until the use of powerful psionics was a way of life. Mind-reading, telekinesis, extrasensory perception and clairvoyance became common among the Zhodani. The Imperium disdainfully outlawed the use of any form of psionics, believing these strange powers to be an invasion of mental privacy. Also, because the Zhodani utilized their superior mental ability in everyday life, many Imperial traders and merchants grew suspicious of their motives and avoided negotiations with the Zhodani.\nThe Imperial race, lacking psionics, saw its development grow along creative, artistic and emotional paths. And as with any creative society, wondrous achievement and joy was often coupled with imperfections and greed. The Zhodani - viewing the Imperial race as dishonest, morally corrupt, weak and insecure - lived highly structured and unemotional lifestyles. With two powerful societies so clearly opposed in political and social beliefs, confrontation was inevitable.\n\nAs the Zhodani continued to expand into the Spinward Marches, many worlds were peacefully integrated into the Zhodani Consulate. However, several independent worlds resisted the Zhodani, believing that they would lose their freedom and be forced to live under restrictive rule. The Spinward Marches became an intergalactic 'hot spot' and the aggressive advances of the Zhodani led to the first of several conflicts known as the Frontier Wars,the first of which began in 589 - 89 years after the two great powers first established contact.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vepjlv9wahp1op5tny5p.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Empire Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":12679,"name":"MegaTraveller 2: Quest for the Ancients","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Your adventure begins outside the hotel in the Rhylanor Startown.

A block reappearing on top of P. P. Hammer kills him. P. P. Hammer can collect treasures and various power-up potions lying around the level. When he has collected all the treasures, the exit door opens, and going through the exit door completes the level.

The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.\n\nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.\n\nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost.\n\nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt.

In the game the player flies a fictional AH-73M attack helicopter.\n\nThe game consists of several campaigns for each one of ten world areas. The campaigns are themed around real events or activities in these areas (e.g. escorting a UN humanitarian convoy during the Bosnian War, fighting pirates in the South China Sea, etc.)\n\nA typical campaign consists of four or five missions. Each mission has a primary objective that must be completed to successfully complete the mission, there are other targets in each missions such as tanks and SAM launchers but these are only used to help the player boost their score. The primary target is usually a major structure like an enemy base or a bridge.\n\nUsually the player is equipped with a standard set of weapons - 16 missiles, 76 rockets, and a machine gun with unlimited ammunition. On some special missions the rockets are replaced by a weapon that is critical to the success of that particular mission, such as a runway cratering system when the primary objective is to destroy an airbase or a bomb when destruction of a bridge is the primary objective.\n\nThe control system for Thunderhawk was fairly unique for the platforms supporting a mouse. It used the mouse for basic control, plus some keyboard input for rarely used commands. Moving the mouse would tilt the helicopter in the specified direction, and make it start moving in that direction. Pressing the left mouse button fires weapons. When the right mouse button was held, moving the mouse up and down changed altitude, while side to side yawed the helicopter side to side.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3eiy.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Core Design","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":12915,"name":"Ikki","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ikki is a Japanese arcade game developed by Sunsoft.
