Players only have a certain amount of time in the towers before Elena's curse worsens (displayed as a meter on the player's screen) and the player is forced to exit the tower in order to give Elena flesh; thus it is important for the player to take shortcuts in order to reach the top as well as to go back.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co26hn.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"XSEED Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ganbarion","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo SPD Production Group No. 2","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":2248,"name":"Frozen Synapse","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Frozen Synapse is a thrilling PC, Mac, Linux and tablet (iOS/Android) strategy game.

There are six different race modes to solve during the career; e.g. regular races and \"trailblazer\" (no passenger available).

Should the player wish, they may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to accelerate actions.

Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.\n\nL.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.\n\nThe game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ldn.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Rockstar Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Rockstar North","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Take-Two Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team Bondi","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Rockstar Leeds","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"SteamVR"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":317859,"name":"Castlevania II: Simon's Quest Revamped","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Castlevania II: Simon's Quest Revamped is a fan reimagining of the NES original in a 16-bit style with added subweapons, new music, an in-game map and more!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co97le.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":305297,"name":"Bomb Fight","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A simulator of the handheld game of the same name.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8c0o.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MADrigal","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":286423,"name":"Final Fantasy XI: Ultimate Collection - Abyssea Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":216302,"name":"Blue Sphere Plus","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Blue Sphere Plus is a Sonic & Knuckles hack.

The other blobs don't want him to do so and will do anything to stop him. The game is somewhat similar to Pac-Man where the Billy has to navigate a single screen labyrinth eating all the beans while avoiding getting hit by the other blobs. To aid him Billy can release bean gas to slow down his adversaries.\n\nDesert Race: This is a simple top down racing game with check points. The player has to make it to the next check point before the time runs out while avoiding traffic. Passing a check point or shooting cars along the way will add extra bonus time.\n\nETMD - Earth Defence: Earth is being invaded by aliens and it's up to the player to stop them! Aliens keep hovering down towards Earth while firing projectiles. The player controls a space ship with which he/she needs to take down the aliens before they reach Earth at the bottom of the screen. When Earth's defenses hit 0%, it's game over! This game supports up to 4 players.\n\nFishy Fishy: This is a side scrolling game in which the player controls a hungry fish. The goal is to keep eating all the smaller fishes to constantly refill the ever draining health meter. This has to be done while avoiding big fishes and other obstacles such as toxic waste barrels.\n\nGreedy Worm: All the worms in the mud pile are hungry for cupcakes! In this Snake variant there are two modes of gameplay. If played single player, the task is to survive as long as possible while eating lots of cupcakes and gaining length, while avoiding the other snakes. If played in multiplayer, the goal is to eat the most cupcakes while trapping the other worms for extra points.\n\nHungry Hungry Toilets: What do toilets eat when they are hungry? Oranges fall down from the sky and by dashing and jumping the players have to have their toilet eat more oranges than the others. It's also possible to jump off of other toilets to gain extra height while at the same time stunning them. The toilet which devoured the most oranges when the timer hits zero wins.\n\nJet Pack Jack: Jack must go into the evil caves of planet Zog and retrieve the stolen cargo. To his aid he has his jet pack and a laser gun. The player controls Jack as he makes his way through the single screen caverns using his jet pack for propulsion and his laser gun to dispose of enemies (which will constantly respawn), while trying to get the cargo boxes to the teleporter. As the levels progress, the amount of cargo which needs to be collected increases.\n\nLame Invaders: Lame Invaders have decided to take over Earth, and it's up to the player to use his/her starship to take out as many of the intergalactic idiots as possible before they can finalize their plans. The game is a side scrolling shoot 'em up where the player has to take down endless waves of enemies in space while gathering bonuses.\n\nPoor Man's Video Poker: This game is a simple video poker machine simulation where each bet is 1 credit. The player gets dealt a hand and can choose to hold cards for a second hand. If the second hand is good enough, credits get paid out to the player.\n\nRevenge of the Blocks: Blocks have been abused by balls and bats for far too long and are out to seek revenge! Stop them before they get a change to exact revenge on you. This game plays like a mix between Breakout and Space Invaders. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen with which a ball needs to be bounced up along the screen to break the blocks lurking at the top. The difference here, however is that the blocks aren't docile blocks. They keep slowly going down while firing at the paddle. Sometimes blocks will dive down on the paddle as well. The paddle on the other hand, has an automatically increasing amount of balls to use against the block uprising.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gi9qwwub4bxhkfo3zgqe.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":65601,"name":"Thor: Son of Asgard","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Thor: Son of Asgard features Marvel's superhero in a mobile game released shortly after the movie \"Thor\" in 2011.

They had a savior. A company called 'Guardians' emerged with enough resources to help evacuate most of the population of Earth. They were heroes. A group of the highest military rank joined the Guardian, and formed the 'military council', to supervise all human activities of outer space. \n \nBut humankind had much to learn. \n \nThe first curse was radiation. While humanity was sitting comfortably on Earth, waiting to be saved, they could not even imagine that most of outer space is lethal to human life. They can't survive certain radiation types, and in the end, they did not dare to explore. They did not go anywhere. They were imprisoned in the few gigantic Star Cruisers of the Guardians. \n \nThen the Guardians claimed that humankind can only survive if they are united, and form the future together. Together, they can be safe. It was a principle that was accepted for a short while, but fanaticism started to slowly take over the Guardian leaders. When they began to see the enemy in everyone, even executing people without much reason, the humans finally started to see what kind of people were controlling them. \n \nThis was the time when more than two million people stole ships from the hangars, and left the Guardian Cruisers far behind. A few million followed in the coming years. \n \nThe Guardians declared these people the 'Pirate horde', and finally, they had a reason to unite. Everyone who remained on the Cruisers became a Guardian, and from then on, the Guardian and Pirate became factions. \n \nHistorians tend to call this separation of human factions 'The Shattering'. \n \nTwo hundred years later the Pirate Wars are still devastating, and even on the brink of extinction, humankind keeps on fighting. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing.

It’s up to you to lead an armor squad through the streets of cities like Baghdad and Tokyo, planning the route and strategically choosing which units to deploy in order to crush the opposition. Take control of the Commander, whose special abilities and quick thinking will be vital in supporting the squad in its mission as you engage in fast-paced, tactical battle across a story-driven campaign and in two heart-pounding Squad Assault Modes.\n\nEnjoy innovative game play, mixing action and strategy in a clever twist on the familiar formula--because this time you're attacking the towers. You will need to think both tactically and strategically, choosing the right squad and the best route for each mission. What worked in the last mission might lead you to wrack and ruin in the next one! Extend tactical possibilities by gathering resources to buy new units and upgrade your squad during a battle.
