Upon running out of fuel the tank was deactivated and the player had to wait to respawn. It could be replenished by collecting fuel canisters. Equipment could also be acquired; this included better weapons, protective shields, and a long-range radar. Other map features included obstacles which could be moved around by the tank, and ferries used for transport over water.\n\nThe game was originally available on the game website Bonus.com, but became defunct when the website closed in 2004.
