If you can draw a compete box without the Qix touching its perimeter, that area of the screen will disappear and get you one step closer to advancing. Adding an element of story, QIX ADVENTURE casts you in the role of Speedy, a treasure hunter who's traveled to a mysterious island. Each level that you pass will help you in your quest to rid the island of all its strange creatures. Easy to learn but extremely difficult to master, QIX ADVENTURE is addicting fun for puzzle lovers and other gamers. Are you quick enough for Qix? Find out alone or against a friend.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6it8.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":49887,"name":"X-Men: Mutant Wars","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color, X-Men: Mutant Wars is a side-scrolling beat 'em-up game and the second X-Men title for the system.

Other developers and publishers have since been brought in for spin-off titles and sequels[1]\n\nThe Spec Ops franchise was intended to introduce a realistic first/third-person shooter experience and immerse the player in a two-man team gameplay. The first two games were well received; and the PlayStation and Dreamcast sequels, developed by Runecraft, received lower review scores.[2] The latest game in the series, Spec Ops: The Line, was highly acclaimed for its narrative, based on the novel Heart of Darkness.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co43at.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":770,"name":"Links 2001","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The venerable golf simulation from Access (nee Microsoft) returns.\n\nNew features in this updated version include new graphics and ball physics, new courses and tour players, centimeter accurate greens, custom club distances; faster, easier online play and golfers that each have their own personalities.\n\nIncluded in the game are some of your favourite golfing heros, Arnold Palmer, Sergio Garcia and Annika S√∂renstam to mention a few.

Each squad contains a leader, five soldiers and one specialist (medic, engineer, PSI for detecting hidden bugs, MIST-Trooper as a sniper). During a mission there is no reinforcement and you are outnumbered by the bugs. The enemy units are not very intelligent, but they use their own special abilities like splitting acid and are very powerful. There is a wide range of enemies, from simple close-range fighters to suicide units, artillery bugs and even human soldiers. The mission objectives are also different. From simple hunting missions up to escorts or the capturing of bugs.\n\nThe game also have a RPG part. Surviving soldiers gain experience points for each killed bug / destroyed bug holes. By and by the soldiers increase their states and acquire higher ranks. Better battle suits (armor) and stronger weapons are only available for soldiers with high ranks. The basic soldier (called Cat Trooper) have no armor and is an easy prey for the bugs. Besides the experience points you gather upgrade points for your equipment for e.g. increase the damage of the weapons. Another aspect of the RPG part is that you can equip each of your soldiers individual with up to two different weapons and two tech-items (like bombs or toxic gas).\n\nThe graphic of the landscape is low on details, everything looks post apocalyptic. Much better is the combat graphic and the explosions. The cutscenes are made with the in-game graphic.

The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of MI6 agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games.\n\nThe game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence.

However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team.\n\nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Den√≠lson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning.\n\nThe club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team.\n\nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/p26lapqrmna33r2qkz5p.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":50015,"name":"Carl Lewis Athletics","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Carl Lewis Athletics is a Sports game, developed by Planet Interactive and published by Ubisoft, which was released in 2000.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":9735,"name":"Battleship: Surface Thunder","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Battleship: Surface Thunder is an updated representation of the classic board game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pj2.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":67790,"name":"Scooby-Doo: Showdown in Ghost Town","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Scooby-Doo: Showdown in Ghost Town is the first in a series of educational point and click video games by The Learning Company.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/w2kaoazcx0bbdc1hzzrh.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":45226,"name":"Danger Girl","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Danger Never Looked So Good!\n\n3rd person action-adventure has never been sexier with DANGER GIRL, the only videogame based on on the best-selling comic book series by J.

The game was developed by Fireglow based in Russia and published by CDV software of Germany. The player selects a faction (e.g. Soviets, Germans, or Allied forces) and gains control of many varied units such as infantry, tanks and artillery. The games focus primarily on tactics, eschewing traditional real-time strategy resource gathering and base development.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe main story features three campaigns (Soviets, Germans, and Allied forces). The battles are presented in an isometric perspective with line-of-sight occlusions and practical cover. Sudden Strike helped pioneer the real-time tactics genre, building upon concepts established by Counter Action for DOS, which was published by Mindscape in 1996.\n\nSudden Strike utilizes accurate in-game physics with houses and buildings obstructing units' view, line-of-sight and firing range whereas clumps of trees can provide cover to reduce the damage of tank ordnance. The game allows units to garrison a building for a stronger firing position, especially valuable for anti-tank infantry. Units can also hold their fire, providing much-needed reconnaissance. Damage evaluation is also realistic; tanks or other vehicles that take too much damage are rendered immobile unless repairs are made.\n\nSUDDEN STRIKE FOREVER:\nSudden Strike Forever was an official add-on to Sudden Strike which introduces many more historically correct units and equipment, such as the upgraded Soviet T-34 tank (1944 version). New terrains are also provided: a desert terrain for the British missions in Tobruk and Tripoli and snow terrains for Soviet missions. The expansion also polished the game engine, balanced the damage of certain units, and added a map and scenario editor.\n\nThe add-on includes 4 inter-linked scenarios for each of the campaigns for the Germans, the American, the British and the Soviets. Other units which are added into the add-on includes, but not limited to the Universal Carrier for the British; the BR-5 artillery, 160mm grenade launcher for the Soviet forces and more. The supply system has also been tweaked with artillery crews automatically resupplying themselves with ammo crates nearby instead of relying on supply trucks to do the job. The supply trucks would still be needed to repair damages inflicted on these artillery units, however.\n\nThe German campaign puts the player into the winter setting of Russian hinterlands with limited troops and reinforcements available, thus relying on use of captured Soviet artillery as well as equipment. The British campaign deals with the defense of an unnamed seaport from German attacks, whereas the American campaign probably takes place in France during the autumn season as the foliage on the vegetation suggest. The Soviet campaign involves a large armored division counter-attack on Russian soil and the storming of the Wehrmacht-controlled airfields. As with the earlier Sudden Strike original campaigns, the briefings do not explain the historical setting of the campaign, thus only issuing standardized orders to the player to e.g. dispel enemy attacks or to simply take over a designated airfield in the east and so on. The add-on also includes 5 new single player individual scenarios.\n\nRECEPTION:\nAs indicated by the cover art the game was regarded as \"The Best Real-time Strategy Game of the Year\" and generally received positive reviews.Sudden Strike holds a 69 Metascore based on 16 critics and an 8.2 user score based on 15 ratings on Metacritic. Sudden Strike Forever holds a 70 Metascore from 5 critics and an 8.8 User Score based on 46 ratings.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1o9q.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":3606,"name":"Stunt Racer 64","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Set in some unspecified time in the future, the gameplay includes more than simple racing.
