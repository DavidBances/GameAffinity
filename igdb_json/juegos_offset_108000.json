From Optical Camouflage to Quantum Barriers, from a detector that alerts you of approaching enemies, to a medical instrument that heals squad mates; anything and everything can be built, by you, and that's not all. You can choose whatever skills you think will help your strategy the most in any battle.\nWe've even created a vertical combat concept. With parkour features including climbing, gliding, and rolling, players can experience vertical battles on a variety of terrain, including mountains, swamps and deserts. In this game, the arena that hosts your battles are not just a huge, flat map, but a world where you can fly in the sky and move underground. We have also created a number of exploration points scattered throughout the world. Here, you can explore temples in the desert with a chance of finding E-Cores to unlock new skills and weapons.
