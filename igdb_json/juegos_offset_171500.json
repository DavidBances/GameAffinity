PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm. The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow. You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back. Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased. Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage. Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps. Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!\n\nThe PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.

The game follows a traditional role-playing design, based around exploration and turn-based combat.\n\nThe gameplay of Blue Dragon uses turn-based gameplay elements seen in older Japanese role-playing video games. The game world contains two major types of areas: towns, in which the player can rest and purchase items, and dungeon-like areas, with numerous foes to be defeated.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qad.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"XAX Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Artoon","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mistwalker","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bird Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":5563,"name":"IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Oleg Maddox‚Äôs world famous IL-2 Sturmovik series of flight simulators continues to expand.

At certain times the video stops and the player gets to choose what Lara should do next.\n\nThe game is mainly controlled with the remote control's arrow buttons which are context sensitive depending on what Lara has around her. What each button does in a situation appears on the screen. It can for example say \"jump\", \"climb stairs\" and \"open door\". Some commands lead to progress through the game, while others lead to a Game Over screen. Some might be harder, but will make the player earn points, for example when choosing to explore when short on time. When enemies appear it is often possible to choose between shooting or doing a stealth attack. Some puzzle-solving exists as objects are picked up and then have to be used at the right location. In some situations a \"play safe\" option can be chosen. It is essentially a skip feature where Lara will automatically solve the problem.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3lyn.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Little Worlds Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bright Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DVD Player"}]},{"id":75085,"name":"Star Wars: The Best of PC","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Star Wars: The Best of PC is a compilation of five computer games. \n \nStar Wars: Battlefront \nStar Wars: Empire at War \nStar Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic \nStar Wars: Republic Commando","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2j26.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":7959,"name":"The Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of the Nine","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Knights of the Nine have long been disbanded.

The Amahagane are sacred jewels which grant the owners godlike powers, such as Kamui. Now, rumors are spreading of new, ungodly creatures fighting with Heishi warriors, even without the powers of Amahagane. Yoshitsune and his companions must draw their weapons again, and with the new strength given to them by the Amahagane, defeat the new evil to save all of Japan.\n\nGenji: Days of the Blade, sequel to the PlayStation 2 game Genji: Dawn of the Samurai, is an action game, based in ancient/feudal Japan, in which you must defeat a new, mysterious source of evil to save your country. You control one of four characters (changeable in real-time), each with their own weapons, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nYoshitsune Minamoto and Benkei Musashibo, the main characters of the previous game, join with Gozen Shizuka and Lord Buson to complete their quest. Yoshitsune is a young warrior who wields a katana in each hand, Benkei is a mighty warrior-monk who uses a war club and a naginata for weapons. Shizuka is a nimble priestess who is adept with chained blades, and Buson is a God of War from the Overworld who carries a double saber and can use supernatural powers.\n\nThe game play involves fighting many enemies and bosses with regular attacks, combo attacks, and Kamui. Kamui is a power that you can use to summon a magical space around you in which you unleash multiple special attacks on surrounding enemies by pressing buttons in series as they appear on the screen. Your Kamui bar fills as you land successful hits on opponents. The characters travel through both levels based on real locations in Japan and fantasy locations, defeating everything from regular Heishi warriors to giant, mutated enemy crabs. The level design involves platformer elements and solving small puzzles, such as destroying Masho flowers scattered throughout an area to open a door.\n\nThe game also has RPG elements; you collect Amahagane and Mashogane hidden around levels and from fallen enemies. They can be used to augment character stats and weapon attack power, respectively. You can also find new weapons and items such as herbs with healing properties, or scrolls that give you attack bonuses for a period of time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2902.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Republic Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":1278,"name":"Resistance: Fall of Man","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In an alternate 1951, Sgt.

The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels.

We intended to deliver these words somewhat earlier, back when we covered Football Manager Handheld. Both games are, after all, football management sims based on popular PC forebears and revised for PSP, both were released around the same time, and indeed we started our reviewing in tandem.\n\nIt's just that Championship Manager 2006 has taken a little bit longer.\n\nThere are three reasons for this. The first is that, well, it's rather extensive. Whereas Football Manager Handheld opted for a cut-down, retro approach, Championship Manager 2006 goes the other way. It's every bit as huge as its PC parent, covering 55 leagues from the 12 leading footballing nations.\n\nGranted you can only play with the leagues of one country at a time, but each country has all the appropriate teams in all divisions, as well as reserve teams and youth squads. Each of the resultant 25,000 players has the usual mountain of statistics spread over five screens, detailing their skills, form and happiness, and they can all be trained, transfer-listed, praised or damned in the media, fined, demoted or promoted through the ranks, loaned or sold.\n\nThe transfer market is equally thorough, with a filtering system that enables you to search for specifically skilled players augmented by features like being able to scout or declare an interest in a player to unsettle them, and complex deals involving player-exchanges and sweeteners. With clubs negotiating deals or pulling out and media speculation and disgruntled footballers playing their part, Championship Manager 2006 feels real in a way that Football Manager Handheld didn't quite manage.\n\nThe matches themselves are equally involved affairs. There are six different ways to view the action, ranging from quick result to textual descriptions, possession bars, and a 2D match view complete with crowd sounds.\n\nThe latter is obviously the most tantalising attraction. When you're starting as a manager watching your charges (well, coloured circles) scurry around the pitch is even more hypnotic than viewing a mute pub TV, especially at the slowest speed. Combine this with more tactical options than Mourinho could ask for (custom formations, specific team and individual tactics, and even specific runs and passes for players to make) and you'll see how even pre-season friendlies can absorb hours.\n\nYou might also comprehend why it has taken us weeks of on-and-off play (and multiple recharges) to get through just a season. And though the more casual armchair manager might want to skip through things a little more rapidly (or even take advantage of the shorter Challenge mode), the faithful should be over the moon, Brian.\n\nSadly, the second reason for our delayed review ‚Äì the interface ‚Äì isn't as positive. At least ten per cent of our play time must have been frittered away getting to grips with it, and our first few attempts to navigate the hyperlink-strewn pages without a mouse were as frustrating as watching Lampard and Gerrard trying to play the same role in the England midfield. Whilst we did learn how to use shortcuts to ease this torment, the system (like Sven's formation) doesn't feel completely right.\n\nThe final reason for our tardiness? That's the trickiest. We've been reluctant to file our final review because we wanted to be sure how we felt.\n\nIn many ways, Championship Manager 2006 seems to have all the elements of a classic, but it just doesn't entirely convince us.\n\nPrincipally this is down to the match engine, which can feel like it's trying to recreate pinball rather than football. Stray passes, interceptions and the inability to beat players or shoot on target are all part of the real game, but the frequency of these events here in comparison to moments of flowing football are rather soul destroying.\n\nWorse, there's a distinct feeling that the result you get from watching a match is different to that from a quick result, with reported matches offering far more goals than games you play through. Extreme tactical tinkering can help alleviate the situation, but the base level of difficulty seems less forgiving than Alex Ferguson.\n\nAdd to this glitches such as substituted players seeming to reappear, goals being credited to the wrong player and the way certain teams (like Chelsea) seem unbeatable, and what could have been a life-consuming joy becomes an oddly addictive love-hate relationship, as your hopes are raised then dashed and still you come back for more (perhaps it should be called Football Fan Simulator?).\n\nUltimately, Championship Manager 2006 really is a game of two halves, one of which promises glory of Champions League proportions, while the other has a tendency to deliver conference fare. If next season's outing raises its game on the pitch, it really could be deserving of its 'championship' name. Right now, it remains a promising contender.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":21284,"name":"Miami Nights: Singles in the City","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Live the delightful or spiteful life you have always wanted in this groundbreaking social simulation game.
