The game is divided in three main sections. The first is a hidden object challenge with a time limit, where the player has to search for objects on rooms from the house, to sell them later. Instead of the usual list at the side of the screen with names of required items, the game shows slots to store a general type of object, and the player has to click on things that correspond to the category or theme (for example, \"Babies and Kids\" for toys, \"Yard and Garden\" for gardening tools, and so on). Some objects need an extra item to make them work, like power chords and batteries, before they can be collected. Next comes the yard sale, shown in a isometric view, with all the items set on tables and the customers roaming around them. A list at the left side shows clues to what every patron wants (\"woman in red wants to cart some rocks\"). The player has to drag and drop the customers to their items. The final component is the decoration screen, where the money accumulated on the yard sale is spent on curtains, floor covers, furniture and other things. Clues appear that indicate the necessary items to improve the final rating, that goes up to 5 stars.

There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.\n\nMost battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.\n\nThe game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5249.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"JTS","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NEC Avenue","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"JTS","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":67667,"name":"Wing Over 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sequel to the 1997's overlooked Wing Over, Wing Over 2 features a far more involved story mode and leaves behind the tournament-style gameplay which drove the first instalment.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ye8.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Beluga Computer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"JVC Musical Industries","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Victor Interactive Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":67668,"name":"Earth Eternal","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Earth Eternal is a graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game currently under development by Sparkplay Media that is playable in a browser or via a client download on Windows.

Combat and movement are turn-based, allowing the player time to select their responses in combat. The player turns at 90 degree angles and moves space by space. One step or action by the player allows all other characters in the area to take one step or action themselves. The game takes advantage of its deliberately slow pace, encouraging players to take their time and check out every little corner, read the books on every bookshelf, and destroy all the furniture to see if anything is hidden within. Levels include underground passages and weapon development laboratories plus a level involving a moving vehicle.\n\nThe game also includes two mini games: the card game War as well as Chicken Kicking, where the player is awarded points for kicking a chicken into a score area.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co49om.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Fountainhead Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"id Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":67745,"name":"NBA Live 09 All-Play","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"NBA Live 09 All-Play is the Wii-only version of EA's long-running franchise.
