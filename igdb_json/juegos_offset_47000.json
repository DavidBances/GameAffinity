New game features include a ranked difficulty for the computer opponent, denoted by a star gauge in the Duel menu, which ranks from 1 star to 9. As you win duels, the difficulty increases, and the opponent swaps his Deck for a more potent one every time this happens. Later difficulty levels (8-9) allow the opponent to use different Decks in that same level. Losing consecutive duels results in decreased difficulty for the first time in Power of Chaos games. Other options include allowing the opponent to use cards from the previous two games, increasing the difficulty. Also, the option to make many Limited cards Forbidden is given, making the game more balanced.

Heinlein.\n\nThis is one of the few strategy games where you cannot build a base and recruit units. Instead you lead up to three squads into combat. Each squad contains a leader, five soldiers and one specialist (medic, engineer, PSI for detecting hidden bugs, MIST-Trooper as a sniper). During a mission there is no reinforcement and you are outnumbered by the bugs. The enemy units are not very intelligent, but they use their own special abilities like splitting acid and are very powerful. There is a wide range of enemies, from simple close-range fighters to suicide units, artillery bugs and even human soldiers. The mission objectives are also different. From simple hunting missions up to escorts or the capturing of bugs.\n\nThe game also have a RPG part. Surviving soldiers gain experience points for each killed bug / destroyed bug holes. By and by the soldiers increase their states and acquire higher ranks. Better battle suits (armor) and stronger weapons are only available for soldiers with high ranks. The basic soldier (called Cat Trooper) have no armor and is an easy prey for the bugs. Besides the experience points you gather upgrade points for your equipment for e.g. increase the damage of the weapons. Another aspect of the RPG part is that you can equip each of your soldiers individual with up to two different weapons and two tech-items (like bombs or toxic gas).\n\nThe graphic of the landscape is low on details, everything looks post apocalyptic. Much better is the combat graphic and the explosions. The cutscenes are made with the in-game graphic.

Single player Mode offers a knock-out cup and a league where every team will play every other team, and the one with the most points at the end comes top.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co74mw.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":50985,"name":"The Conduit: Special Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As Washington D.C. is embroiled in chaos, Secret Service agent Michael Ford finds himself recruited by a mysterious organization known as The Trust, and is quickly caught up in a national crisis, an alien invasion and a web of conspiracies that date back hundreds of years.

In the party modes, you must compete with other players and find as many mistakes as possible. In the 1 Player mode, you must find the differences before time runs out in order to to beat the game’s highest scores. \n \nHow far do you think you can go? \n \nFeatures: \n \n• 5 different game modes. \n• For All Ages. Everyone can play. It is fun to play alone or in a group. \n• Fun Photos. The photos are funny and varied, and the players enjoy their content. \n• Surprising Mistakes. We have worked with over 6 different types of errors (shape, size, colour, arrangement, existence and distortion), and we have designed different difficulties. Many of the mistakes used boost the original photo. \n• Number of Photos. The game consists of over 300 photographs of different subjects and types. From landscapes to drawings, as well as everyday shapes or scenes, the variety of subjects has been a key point in the development of the game. \n• We created special algorithms that make it nearly impossible to repeat the same differences in the same photo. The game includes 333 photos. \n• Simplicity. The player controls the game in just a few seconds. The mistakes can be selected in either the left or right photo, the double cursor was enabled to make it easier to highlight the mistakes, and player aids have been implemented, such as controller vibration when the players are near mistakes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/z9yriapmxfsc1hyij8qo.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":51104,"name":"Oops!

As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa.\n\nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2zcv.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo SPD","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Koei Tecmo Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":51150,"name":"Bayonetta 2: Special Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5rc6.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":51151,"name":"NES Remix Pack","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"NES Remix Pack is a compilation of two releases of NES Remix, the game that combines all the great Nintendo games into one remixed collection of fast-paced and crazy challenges.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8fre.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":51152,"name":"TNT Racers: Nitro Machines Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Start your engines!

Each player (2 to 6, computer or human) has an army of particles and a cursor. The objective of the game is to assimilate all enemy particles. The players can only move their cursors and cannot directly control the particles. Each particle follows the shortest path around the obstacles to its team's cursor. A player may have several thousands particles at a time, giving the collection of particles a look of a liquid blob. When a particle moves into a particle from a different team, it will fight and if the opponent particle fails to fight back (it is not moving in the opposite direction) it will eventually be assimilated by its attacker. As particles cannot die but only change teams, the total number of particles on the map remains constant. Since a particle can only fight in one direction at a time (towards its team's cursor), a player that surrounds its opponents will have a distinct advantage. The game ends when one player controls all of the particles or when the time runs out. When the time runs out, the player with the most particles wins.\n\nThere are multiple maps which affect the obstacles in the battlefield. These obstacles may affect the strategies of the game.\n\nLiquid War is a multiplayer game and can be played by up to 6 people on one computer, or over the Internet or a LAN. A single player mode is available in which the opponents are controlled by the computer.

The game is the sequel to Soviet Strike and the fifth instalment in the Strike series, which began with Desert Strike on the Sega Genesis. The Soviet Strike development team also created Nuclear Strike. EA released a PC port the same year; THQ developed and in 1999 published a Nintendo 64 version called Nuclear Strike 64.\n\nNuclear Strike is a helicopter-based game, with strategy elements added to the action gameplay. The plot concerns an elite special force - the player's allies - pursuing a nuclear-armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting. It retained the earlier game's engine but added several modifications to improve graphical performance and make the game more accessible. The game features 15 playable vehicles, a large increase from previous games. In addition to the main fictionalised Apache, there are secondary helicopters, jets, armour and a hovercraft. The player also commands ground troops in occasional real-time strategy sections.\n\nThe game received positive, negative and mixed reviews. Critics noted a weak storyline, though GameSpot dismissed this is as unimportant in an action game. GameSpot called the graphics - which made use of specialised hardware such as 3Dfx Voodoo video cards and the N64 Expansion Pak - \"about as good as it gets\", while Allgame said they are \"decent\" and Daily Radar called them \"horrible\". Critics praised the full motion video as well as the music and sound effects. Reviewers enjoyed the straightforward gameplay but several complained of a close similarity to its predecessor Soviet Strike and questioned the game's value as a result.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qv5.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Granite Bay Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"EA Orlando","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":51276,"name":"FreeJack","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An MMORPG parkour racing game that was shut down.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4oh1.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":51277,"name":"BOFH: Servers Under Siege","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A group of insane activists called the \"Internet Salvation Force\" has invaded a school, taking all servers and workstations as hostages.

Players just connect to a virtual world where they have to prove their skills while advancing through all the 100 levels (Beginner, Rookie, Super Rookie, Semi Pro, Pro, S1, S2, S3, S4 - Master), based on the amount of experience points they have gathered after each game played. The player can create up to three characters of either gender. Before players can start a game, the character must have equipped at least one weapon and one skill. Players can choose between close-range, mid-range, long-range (sniping), mental, throwing, and support weapons. Players can also choose between active or passive Skills.\n\nCostumes, items, weapons and skills can be bought from the game shop with PEN or AP. PEN is virtual money, earned by playing matches, while AP is earned by paying real money (multiple methods, from credit cards to mobile text messages, specific to each country). Costumes, items, weapons and skills can be permanent or rented (hour-based or day-based). Permanent stuff needs repairs after each use, rented stuff doesn't. Day-based items follow the real life time, while hour-based items count only when playing.\n\nAfter players create and equip their characters with items purchased from the shop, they are ready to join a server based on country/language, and then join a room based on Game Mode. A room can have maximum 12 players connected: 6 players in Alpha Team and 6 players in Beta Team.\n\nThere are various modes in the game:\nIn Touchdown Mode , the most played game mode, players must take a yellow, bouncing ball called \"fumbi\", run with it to the other side of the map and put it in the red goalpost.

Only one item can be carried at a time, so picking up one item means leaving behind of whatever item is currently being carried. Some screens have interactive sub elements. For example: you could \"climb\" Pooh's tree and see the limb where he kept his honey pots safely out of the reach of flood waters (a reference to a scene in the Disney animated movie \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\"and Chapter 9 of A.A. Milne's book Winnie-the-Pooh.). The game has no animation in the mode of a traditional Quest game such as King's Quest. Rather, the Hundred Acre Wood existed as a grid of connected static screens.
