At the start of each round, three modifiers on a slot-machine style display are re-rolled, changing gameplay rules and what weapons and monsters spawn. Some of these are fairly normal, like, say, \"explosive weapons\" or \"Imps and their many variants\". Some are quite a bit less normal, like \"drive an invulnerable tank\", \"swarms of the dogs from Wolfenstein 3D\" or \"shrink to the size of a Pinky's toe\". If, after five of these rounds, you've somehow managed to stay alive, a strange and wacky boss will swing by to finish you off. Defeat the boss to achieve victory!
