This title is not meant to be taken seriously, however, it doesn't mean it's not worth playing! Instead of giving you some sort of mind-blowing result, what we've attempted to accomplish here is to simply put a smile on your face, perhaps a bit of disgust in your stomach, and unleash the inner-WTFness within all of us! We wanted to create something ridiculous, something unique, and something fun for all involved! We hope that you enjoy what we've managed to put together for you. \n \nWarning: The Confession is an adult-themed game with graphic textual details. It is not intended for younger audiences or those who are prudish in any way, shape, or form. Some of the topics involved may be deemed lewd, crude, and incredibly offensive.

Freely fly your ship from your orbiting space station down to the planets surface and disembark to play on foot and explore vast cave systems. \n \nMine ores then store them on your ship to deliver to the oribiter. Once delivered you can use them to upgrade your player, weapons and ship. Your tasks include gathering a set amount of bio material from the planets fauna and foliage, harvesting the planet hearts (bosses), and finding hidden alien relics. The more you harvest the planet the more alien threat will increase unlocking different enemy types and increasing danger on the planet. \n \nTerrene is part survival game. You have limited oxygen on the surface, explore as much as you can before returning to your ship. Upgrade your player to increase your oxygen so you can spend more time and dig deeper. Player health can only be restored by harvesting planet fauna. Dying will return you to your ship and leave behind a backpack that you will need to retrieve to get your inventory back. Dying again will mean the backpack is lost forever. \n \nUse certain ores types to unlock and upgrade different primary and secondary weapons. Weapons to unlock include, rifle, shotgun, sniper lazer, and flame thrower. Secondary weapons include grenades, shield, mines and cluster mines. Homing missiles and bombs can be unlocked for your ship. Choose which weapons you prefer and spend your upgrades however you see fit. \n \nThe Terrene world is procedurally generated by a seed of your choosing, it is 5000 blocks wide and is made up of ten different randomly generated biomes. Each biome contains its own plant and rock types, procedural textures, its own enemy spawn set, ore spawn rates and landscape style. Use your ship to quickly traverse the landscape, and set down wherever you would like to explore.
