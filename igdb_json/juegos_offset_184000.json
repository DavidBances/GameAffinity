Like those other games, Endnesia is a puzzle-solving adventure with RPG elements such as statistics, item-gathering, and character growth.\n\nThe theme of the game is sharing emotions; gameplay-wise, it translates into puzzle-solving which involves using the right emotion on the right characters at the right time. For example, using the Hunger emotion on an animal will make it hungry, urging it to find food, which will clear the path for the hero.\n\nSimilarly to Moon and its descendants, Endnesia has a day-night cycle. The hero's health meter is depleted due to exhaustion; though the game's world is quite large, the player always has a time limit for his daily activities. The player should also feed the hero; hunger makes his vision blurry and slows down his pace.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ykl.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Enix Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Vanpool","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":71518,"name":"Shades of Doom","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An audio-based game designed for the visually impaired inspired by the graphical shooter Doom.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":71305,"name":"Exodus Guilty Neos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A fully voiced port of the PlayStation game, Exodus Guilty.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/k5rfs40qqmntgmzeb9sb.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":63466,"name":"Gekisha Boy 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sequel to the cult classic PC Engine action game about photography!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5rtg.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Irem","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":58522,"name":"League Series Baseball 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second baseball title in the Magical Sports series and the only one released outside of Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/luh1ok2bbkjvslktf3cd.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":282104,"name":"The Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A trimmed-down port of \"The Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack\" for PC, including the following titles:\n\n- FreeCell\n- LifeGenesis\n- Minesweeper\n- SkiFree\n- TicTactics\n- TriPeaks\n- Tut's Tomb","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7llj.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Saffire Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Cryo Interactive Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":43869,"name":"Asterix: Mega Madness","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It's party time, and the Gauls are planning to celebrate in style by having one of the biggest parties they've ever seen.
