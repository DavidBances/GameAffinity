As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n\nHitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fgr.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Feral Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nixxes Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mi'pu'mi Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"IO Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sumo Digital","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Google Stadia"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":9987,"name":"Astroloco: Worst Contact","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the far future, humans explore and colonise space using ridiculously deadly, moon-sized trains - 'Astro Locomotives'.

Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing about action-packed mecha on mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: Gunpla aka Gundam Model Kits! For those new to this specific spin-off, the core mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own Gundam based on the many real life parts featured in the game; the previous title, Gundam Breaker 2, included over 100 Gunpla kits to choose form, which massively increased the number of options and customizations available to a total of over 10,000,000,000 different options! Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own! The SD (Super Deformed) series of Gundam will now also be available in support roles, who will take instructions from the player during battles. SD Gundams can only be set to \"Module,\" the effects of which will extend to the full team. A new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ol3.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Crafts & Meister","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ilinx Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":18367,"name":"Hard West: Scars of Freedom","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Experience a brand new tale in the weird world of Hard West during 7 new, specially crafted tactical combat encounters and overarching world map gameplay.

The king's greed knew no bounds and set out to bankrupt his people by taxing their hard earned acorns. With no acorns to any of the peasant's names they grew angrier and angrier as each day passed. \n \nOn one cold dark evening, the King had sent his loyal tax man to collect the acorns from Charles DeMontequirrel who had refused to pay the unjust nut tax. As the tax man knocked on Charles' wooden door it swung wide open. Charles stood before the tax collector visibly upset as he was scolded for not following the king's unfair decrees. Charles could no longer simply refuse to pay up and wanted only to set things right. He snatched the legal document the collector shoved in his face and tore it to pieces. A call to arms was made and a skirmish set outside of Charles' house as he began his battle with the tax man and set forth on his rodent revolution upon the king and his men. \n \nDo you have what it takes to start a revolution?","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co29ed.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"High Tale Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":20364,"name":"Split","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Split is a beautifully minimalist puzzle game where you divide yourself to explore, solve and create.

Drive a two-door, three-door, or a true-to-life articulated bus through commuter traffic at rush hour, watch out for emergency vehicles, and take detours around construction sites. But watch out, or you will get into trouble for accidents and traffic violations!\n\nYou also have to maintain order inside the bus. Calm upset passengers, repair stuck doors, sell tickets correctly, and extend the ramp for wheel chair passengers in a timely manner. You will have to be efficient if you want to stick to your schedule, as it is only by doing this that you will build up your reputation in the city, earn the trust of your passengers, and most importantly, make money! The better your reputation, the larger the contracts you can secure, and the more buses will be available to your company in the shop. Unlock additional districts of the city and carefully plan routes for the employees you will acquire in the included job exchange.\n\nAs you grow more successful, you will also acquire more and more advertising banners for your buses, which bring in additional money. If your buses are too dull, you can paint and decorate them with unlockable decals, ensuring that your passengers reach their destinations in the coolest way possible.\n\nYou think bus drivers are lonely? Not in Bus Simulator 16! Invite your friends into your game in multiplayer mode and let them take over routes for you.

Perfectly done.\n\n---\nLOVE THIS GAME!!! by Dezign09\n\"I would recommend this game to anyone! It's fun relaxing and challenging all at the same time.\"\n\n---\nIT'S REALLY GOOD by Turbo444\nFive months of daily play, and it’s still fun. Many puzzle games have levels that get progressively more difficult, until I get to the point where it’s just not fun anymore, and I stop playing. Wooden Block Puzzle has just one level. It is always the same... never gets harder to play. But it never gets boring, and has actually become more fun the longer I play, because the possibilities are endless, and the challenge is built-in. You can try to beat your own high score... or not. Very well-crafted by some genius developer. Thanks, Dev.\n\n---\nPERFECTLY DISTRACTING by MonsterNmyHead\nYou ever get really bored? Ever turn on some music but didn't wanna dance but stillllll you wanted to do SOMETHING? Get tired of waiting for a text back? Are you anxious? Is the party you're at super lame?? Play this game and none of those things will be a problem ever again. Highly addicting game. So simple. You're in competition with yourself. And honestly what's better?\n\n---\nWOOD PUZZLE by Houston Astros Fan\n\"Good thought for eye and hand. Moves fast enough to keep you interested. I love it!\"\n\n---\nLOTS OF FUN by Kym6erlee\n\"I just recently downloaded this game and after the first game, I was absolutely in love. It's challenging entertaining, and requires a degree of concentration but without too much stress. Very similar to Tetris but the tiles do not rotate so you need to place them as they appear and the set of three tiles will not be replaced until the three present are situated on the board. That's how you will either win or lose the game. I recommended it.\"\n\n---\nWOODEN BLOCKS by Merina\n\"Ok, I hate the friend who introduced this fun and addicting game to me yesterday. I sat and played for 90 minutes straight, telling myself \"only one more game... \"I LOVE this game. Just when I think I've outsmarted the game it comes back and shows me who's boss. It's an easy, clever game, much the old Tetris, just not as fast.
