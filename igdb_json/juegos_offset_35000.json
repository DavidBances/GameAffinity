The gods, touched by the sincerity of the young woman's devotion and love, decide to give Sylphia another chance... Now turned into a Sylphid with tremendous powers, the female warrior embarks on a long journey of revenge, ready to fight for her homeland. Sylphia starts equipped with a fairly basic fire weapon that can be upgraded in various ways - four different types based on the four basic elements are available throughout the game, from Fire (Red), Air (Green), Water (Blue) and Earth (Brown). Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level).

The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius' inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius' societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.\n\nThe Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.\n\nThe game is set in the inner half of the solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius.\n\nThe red/green/blue powerups from the first game return, and have the same function: respectively, upgrades to the \"missile\" main weapon and \"bomb\" subweapon, and a shield to absorb some damage. Two new power-ups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new \"laser\" main weapon that functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to all the players weapons.\n\nActually acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is completely different from Darius: a formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a given formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Further, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade the same as before.\n\nAnother new feature in Darius II is the appearance of minibosses known as \"captains\"; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss. In Darius II, these are all smaller versions of bosses from the first game, with similar abilities.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xx5.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NEC Avenue","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":37642,"name":"6-in-1 Fami Collection: NES Collection Nr 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":37643,"name":"15-in-1 Mega Collection: Backtracking Ten Years","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Contains fifteen different games originally released for the VIC-20.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":37644,"name":"5-in-1 Fami Collection: NES Collection Nr 1","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"5-in-1 Fami Collection: NES Collection Nr 1 is an unlicensed multicart released for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 in 1993.

Equipped with the legendary axe ‘Sting’, he braves the six zones of Jagu’s territory to defeat the cult and save his love. \n \nThroughout the zones are breakable Jagu idols which drop various sized gems for points leading to extra lives, health revitalizing orbs of differing strength, crown-like crystal containers, and wing icons. Four crystal containers can be earned which charge the destructive power of Sting’s strike, while up to two wings can be collected increasing the speed of subsequent strikes. \n \nEach time you use the axe, the power meter drains completely then recharges as long as you don’t continue to swing. The added strategy of - is it better to dodge and charge the axe for a crushing blow, or is it better to hack away as fast as possible – sets this game apart from most other hack-n-slashers. When you die, one level of speed and axe power is taken away and you must re-find an icon to get it back. The game doesn’t lock you to only scrolling right, so there are times where you can backtrack to find items. \n \n-http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Legendary_Axe.htm","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":37675,"name":"Makai Hakkenden Shada","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A PC Engine Action-RPG based on the famous Japanese novel series Nansou Satomi Hakkenden. The gameplay is at least partly inspired by Falcom's Ys series.\n\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.\n\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \"Eight Dog Chronicles\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \"dog\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations. Okami also contained an oblique reference to the novels.\n\nUnlike Satomi Hakkenden, which eventually allowed the player to recruit all eight of the central characters of the novel series, Makai Hakkenden Shada only has the one playable character. Instead, other characters from the novels occasionally appear to help the player.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5xoa.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"G-mode","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Data East","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":37676,"name":"Mahjong Shikaku Retsuden: Mahjong Wars","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A dual Mahjong game/RPG from Nihon Bussan.\n\nMahjong Shikaku Retsuden: Mahjong Wars (\"Mahjong Assassin Chronicles: Mahjong Wars\") is a PC Engine Mahjong game from Nichibutsu/Nihon Bussan, related to their Mahjong Triple Wars game.

It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game.\n\nSuper Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board. Every time the player fails to complete a puzzle, the player's health will deplete, as indicated by Arle or Rulue's expression gradually getting more distressed. If the player's health depletes completely, they'll receive a Game Over and can either choose to continue from the last save or quit back to the title. The player can recover completely if the gauges on the right side of the screen fills completely and rank up, with each cleared puzzle filling it gradually. On the pause menu, the player has the option to skip a puzzle at the cost of health.\n\nThere are five game modes: Arle's Roux, Rulue's Roux, Road to Chains, Endless Puyo, and Editor. In the first three modes, the player must solve the presented tasks with a set of available Puyo. Arle's Roux focuses on a scenario with Arle, acting as the normal course with her puzzles only involving standard Puyo. Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area. Road to Chains acts as a challenge mode where the player is given a series of puzzles to solve at a gradually increasing difficulty, with the player being unable to restore health.\n\nThe Endless Puyo mode is a regular endless mode except that 6 next Puyo are shown instead of 1 next Puyo, and that nuisance Puyo will fall in the higher levels of difficulty. The Editor mode allows you to place Puyo freely in a manner similar to Practice Notebook in Puyo Puyo 7. You can also set a list of next Puyo and the task to be solved.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3jha.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Compile","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Banpresto","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"St. GIGA","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"}]},{"id":37807,"name":"Sugoro Quest++ Dicenics","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sugoro Quest++ Dicenics is a Miscellaneous game, published by Technos, which was released in Japan in 1994.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jd1.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Technos Japan","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":37808,"name":"Turf Memories","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Turf Memories is a Sports game, published by Bec, which was released in Japan in 1995.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vvxjnucx8g9v72wnprsz.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"BEC","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":37809,"name":"Super Naxat Open","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Naxat Open is a Sports game, developed by Kuusou Kagaku and published by Naxat Soft, which was released in Japan in 1994.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":37810,"name":"Super Momotaro Dentetsu II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Momotaro Dentetsu II is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Make and published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1992.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4c7f.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Make Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":37811,"name":"Super Mahjong Taikai","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Mahjong Taikai is a Miscellaneous game, published by Koei, which was released in Japan in 1992.

A Japanese man and woman portrayed in the distinct business man/woman (\"Kaisha-in 事務員\") satire comedy Kotobuki Shiriagari \"Heta-Uma へたうま\" style, turn up at work but they can't understand the greetings their co-workers are saying.

Logos Panic pits players to scramble Japanese Kanji in a sort of Tetris puzzle style scenario; kanji must be correctly put together in time, simultaneously as new kanji pop out at the bottom of the screen.

It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz).\n\nAt first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two \"arrows\", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a \"season\" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.\n\nAlong the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.\n\nEvery so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.\n\nThe player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co306z.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":37946,"name":"Super Uno","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Uno is the video game adaptation of the card game of the same name.

This is a different port than the title \"Darius+\", which was published by The Edge and developed by Softek for the Amiga, Atart ST, and ZX Spectrum.\n\nAmidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\n\nYes, fish.\n\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\n\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\n\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\n\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\n\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\n\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\n\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:\n- Darius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\n\n- Darius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\n\n- Super Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a \"boss rush\" mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xwp.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bits Laboratory","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NEC Avenue","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"},{"id":0,"name":"PC Engine SuperGrafx"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":38079,"name":"Strip Fighter II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Six fighters from around the world fight for supremacy and the prestige of being the strongest and sexiest fighter ever to grace the arena.
