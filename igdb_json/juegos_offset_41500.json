It was also released on the Sega Saturn.\n\nThis compilation includes the classic games:\n\n- Konami's Tennis (1984):\nReleased in 1984, Konami's Tennis plays much like Atari's Realsports Tennis but with ladies instead of men. The game can be played by one player against the CPU, two player singles or two player doubles. A referee in the tower tells whether the ball is in or not. Serving and shooting is a simple matter of timing against the 3D animated ball, and you need not worry whether it is to the left or right of your player. Certain features uncommon at the time, such as net balls and a ball fetching boy, are also supported.\n\n- Konami's Soccer (1985):\nSoccer is an action game for two players or one player against the computer. You can play the game in one of five skill levels, choose from several different teams, and select the amount of time the match will take. Soccer features throw-ins, goal kicks, corner kicks, penalty kicks and an overhead view of the field which scrolls to follow the action.\n\n- Konami Rally (1985):\nA basic racing game in which you have to finish within the time limit and reach the finish with a given ranking. You 'll start as the last driver in the field and you will have to fight your way forward by over taking your competitors. The number of cars you 'll have to pass will increase each stage. The car has two gears, low and high and tends to slip in curves.\n\n- Comic Bakery (1984):\nA baker tries to bake and deliver bread while fighting raccoons. Pieces of bread are moving along a factory line. The raccoons try to eat your bread and also try to switch off your machines. You have to keep your machinery running and also scaring away the raccoons. If you do that your delivery truck will be loaded with bread and drive off.\n\n- Pippols (1985):\nA young farmer go in search of the pipul, the sacred tree of Buddah, to get the jewel that is hidden inside of it (a rare flower) and take it back to his home.\n\n- King's Valley (1985):\nKing's Valley is a puzzle game in which you need to collect all the treasures by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck. You'll then have to play the whole level over again.\n\n- Penguin Adventure (1986):\nPenguin Adventure: the main character - a male penguin - must save the penguin princess from a sickness that has spread across the penguin world. The cure to the sickness can be found in the Golden Apple of the Golden Apple Tree. In this action packed game, you take control of the male penguin and travel across the lands and seas in search of the Golden Apple, fighting different types of enemies including bats, thunder-striking clouds, and environmental obstacles such as rocks, until finally reaching the princess. The stages feature different types of landscapes such as forests, mountains, caves, and water stages. As you fight your way through, you can also catch flying fish which you can trade at the different types of shops for new equipments and a weapon.\n\n- Time Pilot (1983):\nTime Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.\n\n- Parodius (1987):\nThis is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms. The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.\n\n- Salamander (1987):\nIn a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7jk5.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":44778,"name":"Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This game is based on the boxing Manga and Anime series \"Hajime no Ippo\" created by Jyoji \"George\" Morikawa.

It is the sequel to Dragon Spirit, released 3 years earlier. \nSTORY: The human beings have repeated their own foolish history, because of their own desires. And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" \n \n- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. \n \n- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. \nYou control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. \n \n- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. \nThe player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. \n \n- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. \nThe players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. \n \n- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. \nThe player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. \n \n- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. It runs on the Namco System 86 hardware platform and was licensed for US distribution to Atari Games.

Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York. \nAlbatross must travel through two different segments or \"stories\", each comprised of five stages, for a total of ten stages.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rhfo9kscsrrlnfwshas3.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":44786,"name":"Namco Anthology Vol.2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This is the second volume of one of the series of Namco game compilations, released only in Japan.

Meanwhile, Susumu's father, Taizou Hori; Susumu'selder brother, Ataru Hori; Anna's Robot Assistant, Horinger Z and Susumu's roomate, Puchi, were all digging to the depths of the earth, aiming for the resolution of this disaster.\n\nWhat is the probable cause of this latest incident?\nAnd, among the 6 Drillers, who will be the one to resolve this disaster?\n\nOur hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller.\n\nIf all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his progress even further are brown \"X-blocks\" that take five drill strikes to disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller's air when broken.\n\nThis game is a Japan-only port of the original Arcade game of the same name.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ox5.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":44789,"name":"The Master's Fighter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It was very popular in America and Europe as \"MASTERS FURY\", but now, the PlayStation \"MASTER'S FIGHTER\" is released as a remake!\n\nBig-scale character made overseas!

One major disadvantage is that the game was only aimed at the readers of the manga, so if you haven’t read the manga, you won’t understand anything of the characters and the background story.\n\nBastard? Destructive God of Darkness is a manga by Kazushi Hagiwara. It first appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump, in 1988, and continues to be published irregularly today in Ultra Jump. Currently, it spans 25 volumes.\n\nIn Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren.\n\nBastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers.\n\nIn the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world.\n\nThe story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society. The episodes are rather disjointed, with scenes missing in between episodes making it hard to follow, but taken at face value it makes enough sense.\n\nManufacturer's description:\n\nHagiwara Hazime solstitial popular comic \"BASTARD!!\" based on an original story developed in RPG.

Each unit has its own \"judgment\" ability\"; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn.\n\nThe story of Langrisser V is closely connected to the one told in Langrisser IV - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe.\n\nThe game's plot revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard...\n\nLangrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\".

It was also released on the Sega Saturn.\n\nThis compilation includes the classic games:\n\n- Konami's Boxing (1984):\nA boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option.\n\n- Konami's Ping-Pong (1985):\nFrom Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.\n\n- Hyper Sports 2 (1985):\nThree tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - skeet shooting, archery and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.\n\n- Mopiranger (1985):\nThe peaceful land of the Mopira have been invaded by the Razons. In this platform game you 'll play Mopiranger and you have to save the young Moplits, who have been kidnapped by the dastardly Razons. The levels are build in a maze-like pattern in which you have to find and rescue the young Moplits from the hostile Razons. Using the obstacles present in the game you can block the Razons, but also lock yourself in...\n\n- Antarctic Adventure (1984):\nAs a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France, New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that enable you to fly over those hazards.\n\n- Yie Ar Kung-Fu (1984):\nBased on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong's quest to become a Kung-Fu master. Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones.

The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. It released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in October 2010.\n\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the area of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The player takes control of the character known as Courier 6, who, preceding the start of the game, is hired by a delivery service called the Mojave Express to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip. The game starts during the delivery, where the Courier is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, the player becomes caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants.\n\nEven though it directly succeeds Fallout 3 in order of Fallout game releases, offers a similar action role-playing experience, and shares its engine and legacy content with Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a direct sequel.

Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ye9.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Take-Two Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Lost Toys","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":45232,"name":"Asterix: The Gallic War","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Asterix: The Gallic War is a light-hearted action-strategy hybrid game featuring the popular Asterix comic book characters.
