He has the Boost, the ability to slide under obstacles, jump off walls, and the Homing Attack. After the second era, Modern Sonic learns the Stomp. Modern Sonic's levels use the 3D effect of depth on the 3DS version more actively as well as to giving a better view for when Modern Sonic jumps into the background, although the console versions are 3D-TV compatible. In the HD version, Modern Sonic is only able to wall jump off certain panels (similar to the DS version of Sonic Colors), but in the 3DS version, he is able to wall jump on any wall (much like Sonic Unleashed and the Wii version of Sonic Colors).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zya.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Dimps","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sonic Team","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":128799,"name":"Taur","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Taur is an action-strategy sci-fi game.
