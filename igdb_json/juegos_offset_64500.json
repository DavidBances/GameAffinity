The gameplay is centered around 9 six-sided dice that feature all 54 playing cards from a traditional deck (including two WILDS).\n\nThe cards are distributed across the dice faces in a patented mathematical formula allowing players an incredibly fun and much easier way to play games that require making traditional playing card hands.\n\nThe mobile game has a familiar but fresh player experience of rolling all 9 dice a total of 3 times while getting to hold what you want to achieve a goal (like Two Pairs, Four of a Kind, Full House, etc). Players play head-to-head against friends, random opponents, and bots to achieve the most goals by filling out their scorecards and receiving bonus points for achieving a higher hand than their opponent. There is a classic 9-Hand Game mode as well as a 3 and 1-Hand game mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5uue.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Deck of Dice Gaming","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":227408,"name":"Hypercharge: Unboxed - Complete Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The complete edition is for true Hypercharge action figure enthusiasts.
