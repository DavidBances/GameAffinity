An apparent technical malfunction has caused the O'Brien's computer to believe that it was in a real life war situation, and select the planet Calliope as a target for destruction. Like all of the human fleet's Cerberus-class destroyers, the O'Brien carries a weapon known as \"Iron Helix\", which is capable of destroying all life on a planet in a single act. An attack on Calliope, a peaceful Thanatosian planet, would cause the war to go \"hot\".\n\nThe player is on board the scientific exploration ship Indiana, and is contacted by the Earth's forces in an attempt to stop the O'Brien, as it was the only ship nearby.

The green one is the Silver Hawk of Darius. The blue one is the Silver Hawk of Darius II. The red one is a new prototype of Silver Hawk that exists only in this game.\n\nThere are three power-ups in this game, which can be obtained in three ways:\n- Destroying a complete formation of ships like in Darius II and Darius Twin or amoebas.\n- Destroying a flashing meteor during a meteor rain.\n- Destroying a futuristic cage on the floor and/or ceiling of an area.\n\nThe power-ups for this game are the red bubble (shot and bomb power up), the blue bubble (shield regenerate and level up), and the green bubble (randomly gives a bonus point or an extra ship). There is also a special power up that can destroy all enemies on screen if it's destroyed (like Darius II) or can make the Silver Hawk shoot a powerful laser beam if its grabbed by the player.\n\nThere is no power up bar, which means that if a Silver Hawk is destroyed, the shots and bombs are powered down to the minimum level. Also, when the player loses a ship on a stage, it is returned to the 'check point' (not identify in game) of that stage, if the ship has lost during a boss also return the last 'check point' before the boss appear.\n\nLike Darius Twin, the player uses (by default) the Y button for shot and the B button for dropping bombs. As long as the player keeps pressed both buttons, the shots are powered down one level. The player can switch between bombs and side laser guns by pressing the R button.\n\nThe stages map for this game is very different of the rest of the Darius games. This map contains 15 stages, but only allows the player to take the forward or up paths, until the player reaches the L, N or O stage. Each one of those three stages contains its own boss and ending.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co91pn.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":42274,"name":"Go!
