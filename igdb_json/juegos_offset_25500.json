The arsenal consists of single or dual pistols, shotguns, machine guns, shotguns and other items such as a scope, dynamite and boiler plates.

Weapons can only contain a small amount of bullets (unless an additional ammo belt is bought) and need to be reloaded regularly. Different body parts can be targeted for different damage and when hit players notice a small slowdown in movement. \n \nSingleplayer is also available with all the team modes, but with the same maps and game modes to be played against bots with customizable skill levels.

The player takes control of Aarzak (Kenshiro in the Japanese original), who fights against his enemies using his punches and kicks. Aarzak can attack while standing, jumping, and crouching, for a total of six basic attacks. In addition to his life gauge, Aarzak has a power-up meter that will gradually fill as he defeats enemies. When the meter reaches a certain point (depending on the stage), Aarzak will transform into a super-powered state, allowing him to perform rapid punches and kicks for the rest of the stage. The game's levels (with the exception of boss battles and maze stages) feature a time limit at the lower-right corner of the screen; but unlike other time limits, instead of killing the character immediately when it reaches, it will instead gradually drain the player's life gauge until the player completes the level.\n\nThe game is divided into four stages or chapters, each featuring several levels. After completing a level the player will be shown a map which displays the player's current location and the paths they can take. Most of the levels are linear side-scrolling segments where the player must simply walk from one to side to the other while fighting every enemy who gets in the way. Other levels are dungeon mazes in which the player must figure out the correct path to the goal while avoiding traps. The player will encounter various allies throughout the game that will increase Aarzak's offensive or defensive strength, or replenish their health. The game features several one-on-one encounters with bosses as well. The player must sometime complete levels in a certain order in order to finish a chapter.\n\n'Last Battle' is also notorious amongst gamers for its harsh difficulty throughout.\n\nThe original Japanese version is based on the Fist of the North Star mangas/animes. During the translation process all references to Fist of the North Star were removed - similar to its predecessor Black Belt.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5ntj.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega R&D 2","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Elite Systems","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Images Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tec Toy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Creative Materials","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":27973,"name":"The Tenth Line","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Guide the princess of the tiny nation of Easania, along with her unusual but reliable companions, and explore a vibrant world of humans, beasts, and dragons, while escaping the clutches of a mysterious cult in hot pursuit.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co23fi.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sungazer Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":27974,"name":"Macbat 64: Journey of a Nice Chap","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Macbat 64 is a low poly 3D Platformer and 4:3 loveletter to the late 90s.\n\nAll the 3D platforming goodness from the late 90s is back!\nSearch, Collect and Jump (multiple times in a row even!) like it's\n1998!\n\n3D Platforming is not enough?

It incorporates a 'good/evil character' morality/alignment system. Like its predecessor Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985), the player has a morality meter that can be aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of experience points, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a statistic called \"MF\" (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps will appear across the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear in the form of random items found around Fairyland. The player can also kill good monsters, which usually lowers the morality meter. Unlike Hydlide II, however, the morality meter no longer affects the way in which the townsfolk react to the player. \n \nThe game also features an in-game clock setting day-night cycles, where the character must eat two times a day and sleep regularly. If the characters stay up late or fail to eat regularly, their HP and attack power gradually drop. Every item in the game (including money) has weight. If the total weight of items the player character carries exceeds their \"Load Capacity\" (LC), they will move slowly. The game uses cut scenes for its opening and ending sequences, a combat system similar to Ys, a choice between four distinct character classes, and a wide variety of equipment and spells.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2srm.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Asmik Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Seismic","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"T&E Soft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"T&E Soft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco Limited","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"}]},{"id":27988,"name":"Planescape: Torment - Enhanced Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"Discover an incredibly rich story and a unique setting unlike anything else in fantasy.

Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors.\n\nAs a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities.\n\nArmed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline.\n\nIn Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7nl6.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"K2 LLC","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":28056,"name":"Rush Hour","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rush Hour is a racing game in the style of Ignition.
