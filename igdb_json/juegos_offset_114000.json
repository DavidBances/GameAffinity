The player can further the plot by travelling to various locations, investing in new companies by buying stocks, and interacting with various characters.

Both the player and opponent have a spirit meter that increases or decreases depending on how successfully one guide's their stock graph during a match. If a meter decreases too much, the player or opponent must recover before continuing to trade, potentially allowing the other to get ahead.

First aid kits and painkillers can be used to restore lost health points, but only painkillers are light enough to be carried and saved for later. The player is also outfitted with a retractable helmet which can be used to reduce incoming damage to the head and a gas mask which is vital for traversing areas contaminated with toxic gas.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3kmm.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Xash XT Group","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kunst-Produkt Laboratory","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":123593,"name":"That's How Sumireko's Roach Stomping Mafia Works","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A platformer game jam project featuring Sumireko Usami from Touhou Project, where she must stomp on cockroaches consecutively using air dashes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2rkh.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"LAME Dimension","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":123594,"name":"Hampton Court","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome to the court of Henry VIII, where your choices decide your fate!
