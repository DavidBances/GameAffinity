Initially this version of the game was exclusively available through a crowdfunding action with a physical release containing a cartridge, but in the spirit of the original game both the game and the source code were eventually made available as a free download afterwards.\n\nThis release improves the original game by correcting a number of map bugs and imperfections. It also adds new colours and tweaks the movement to optimize it and make it more responsive. By completing the game two additional playable characters can be unlocked. Completing it once unlocks Zazelle and a second time Johnny Limite. They each have different moves providing different gameplay.\n\nThe crowdfunded version comes on a cartridge with a box and manual. The cartridges are numbered with a unique serial number. Based on the tier different extras were provided, such as having your name listed in the manual. There is also a tier with a blue cartridge limited to six copies. This tier comes with two bottles of Gik Blue wine.\n\nAlthough not directly confirmed, the CPC version of the game called Sir Ababol: NES-OM Edition listed here is most likely based on this 2017 NES version.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6oux.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"The Mojon Twins","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The Mojon Twins","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"1985 Alternativo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":194642,"name":"LittleBigPlanet: Pirates of the Caribbean Level Kit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Get Sackboy ready for adventure with this downloadable collection of Pirates of the Caribbean goodies, including tons of stickers, music and a Cannibal costume.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kph.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Media Molecule","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":194643,"name":"Banjo X","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Banjo X was a remake of Banjo-Kazooie that Rareware were developing for the Xbox in 2005, which was eventually cancelled and redeveloped into Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5zdz.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Rare","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":194644,"name":"9-nine-: New Episode","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Enjoy short after stories for the heroines of the 9-nine- series in 9-nine-:NewEpisode!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5cwu.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"PALETTE","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sekai Project","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":194647,"name":"State of Decay 2: Daybreak Pack","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":194648,"name":"Coloring Pixels: Retro Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This Retro Book brings 20 new images to Coloring Pixels, each image depicts items or icons that represent the old-school cool retro history!
