Projectile Fighter is like a fighting game but mainly projectiles are used to determine the outcome of a match. Projectile fighters can use a variety of elements for projectiles including light, dark, wind, magma, earth, lightning, aqua, fire, ice, plant and unique. Unique would apply to any projectile that does not fall under any of the other elements. All elements with the exception of unique have a weakness(an element they are weak to) and a counter(an element they counter). All characters have an affinity/element that determines their strongest element, elements they are resistant to and elements they can absorb. Projectile fighters can use basic techniques to attack by throwing projectiles in various directions(horizontally or diagonally upwards while standing and diagonally downwards while jumping) and they can defend themselves by deflecting, dodging jumping over and/or absorbing projectiles. Projectile fighters can also use a long list of special techniques for attacking, defending or powering themselves up. All characters are capable of using any technique but they are most likely to use their favorite techniques. Read the in-game guide/manual to get more information about the mechanics, techniques and terminology associated with the game. Projectile Fighter includes music and features a soundtrack with 7 tracks. Various types of projectiles include light energy, dark vortex, tornado(wind), magma ball, meteor(earth), lightning bolt, aqua ball, fire ball, ice spike, leaf(plant), wood(plant), ki energy, diamond, energy beam, eye beam, shock wave, shuriken, twilight energy, twilight vortex and star. Various classes/types of characters include normal, android, mage, swordsman, ninja, hybrid, alien and deity. Projectile Fighter is a very hard game that requires good reflexes, reactions, patience and focus in order to succeed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qtxttr4jdct8fgrxrphr.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hardai Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":109491,"name":"THE Card: Poker, Texas hold 'em, Blackjack and Page One","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This game includes Poker, Texas hold 'em, Blackjack, and Page One.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4k24.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"D3Publisher","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":109492,"name":"Puzzle Girls: Lingerie","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Join the all girls Dark Research Club and learn about your inner powers and help to bring forth everything you can ever want for yourself.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3y5m.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Dharker Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":109493,"name":"Spider Solitaire F","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The classic card game Spider Solitaire is now playable on PC!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jk8.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Flyhigh Works","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":109494,"name":"Omvorm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome to Omvorm!

Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8he3.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Telenet Japan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shin-Nihon Laser Soft Co., Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":109600,"name":"Lineage II Classic","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Enter the classic world of Lineage II and rediscover the magic of how it all began.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tzdptpt6lyzpazynbie6.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NCSOFT","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":109601,"name":"Summer in Mara","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Take care of your own island.\n\nSummer in Mara is a single-player summer adventure, with an easy-RPG system and exploration elements.
