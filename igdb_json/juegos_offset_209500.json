The battle was an Axis failure, and the Germans considered the operation finished by the middle of July.\n\nFor the Soviets, the early July battles were but the defensive phase of the Battle of Kursk, designed to wear out their German opponent. The Russian offensives that followed, first, Operation Kutuzov in the north, lasting from 14 July to 14 August, and Operation Rumyantsev from 3 August to 23 August were the culmination of the Soviet summer strategy.\n\nFacing the Soviet Union's forces to defend Kharkov were the post Kursk, depleted 4th Panzerarmee and Army Detachment Kempf, soon renamed as 8th Army. Crisis both to the north at Bryansk during Operation Kutusov and on the Mius River to the south on the Azov Sea, saw the Axis forces at their weakest as the Soviets prepared to take back Kharkov in the fourth and final battle for the largest city in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn Rumyantsev '43, as the commander of the three Russian Fronts - Voronezh, Steppe & Southwestern, you have multiple armies at your disposal to defeat the vaunted but battered German Wehrmacht. As the German commander you will have at your disposal the still powerful panzer forces able to wreak havoc upon their Soviet foes.
