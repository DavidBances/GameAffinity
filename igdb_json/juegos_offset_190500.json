It was also released on the Sega Saturn.\n\nThis compilation includes the classic games:\n\n- Konami's Tennis (1984):\nReleased in 1984, Konami's Tennis plays much like Atari's Realsports Tennis but with ladies instead of men. The game can be played by one player against the CPU, two player singles or two player doubles. A referee in the tower tells whether the ball is in or not. Serving and shooting is a simple matter of timing against the 3D animated ball, and you need not worry whether it is to the left or right of your player. Certain features uncommon at the time, such as net balls and a ball fetching boy, are also supported.\n\n- Konami's Soccer (1985):\nSoccer is an action game for two players or one player against the computer. You can play the game in one of five skill levels, choose from several different teams, and select the amount of time the match will take. Soccer features throw-ins, goal kicks, corner kicks, penalty kicks and an overhead view of the field which scrolls to follow the action.\n\n- Konami Rally (1985):\nA basic racing game in which you have to finish within the time limit and reach the finish with a given ranking. You 'll start as the last driver in the field and you will have to fight your way forward by over taking your competitors. The number of cars you 'll have to pass will increase each stage. The car has two gears, low and high and tends to slip in curves.\n\n- Comic Bakery (1984):\nA baker tries to bake and deliver bread while fighting raccoons. Pieces of bread are moving along a factory line. The raccoons try to eat your bread and also try to switch off your machines. You have to keep your machinery running and also scaring away the raccoons. If you do that your delivery truck will be loaded with bread and drive off.\n\n- Pippols (1985):\nA young farmer go in search of the pipul, the sacred tree of Buddah, to get the jewel that is hidden inside of it (a rare flower) and take it back to his home.\n\n- King's Valley (1985):\nKing's Valley is a puzzle game in which you need to collect all the treasures by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck. You'll then have to play the whole level over again.\n\n- Penguin Adventure (1986):\nPenguin Adventure: the main character - a male penguin - must save the penguin princess from a sickness that has spread across the penguin world. The cure to the sickness can be found in the Golden Apple of the Golden Apple Tree. In this action packed game, you take control of the male penguin and travel across the lands and seas in search of the Golden Apple, fighting different types of enemies including bats, thunder-striking clouds, and environmental obstacles such as rocks, until finally reaching the princess. The stages feature different types of landscapes such as forests, mountains, caves, and water stages. As you fight your way through, you can also catch flying fish which you can trade at the different types of shops for new equipments and a weapon.\n\n- Time Pilot (1983):\nTime Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.\n\n- Parodius (1987):\nThis is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms. The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.\n\n- Salamander (1987):\nIn a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7jk5.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":323662,"name":"Train Simulator: Nagoya Tetsudou 1","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An entry in the Train Simulator series of FMV games by Ongakukan, featuring two lines of the Nagoya Railroad.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co93du.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":228633,"name":"Love Escalator","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The third high school year is about to begin, and Takashi Kurosaki decides that it should be a memorable year - at least from the point of view of romantic adventures.

This provokes much jealousy in Asuka, who also suspects that Kirishima is a spy who is trying to get information from Shinji about NERV and the Evas. Rei Ayanami is present but plays a rather background role in the story, though she seems to agree with the suspicions of Asuka. Gradually, a relationship between Mana and Shinji unfolds and they end up going on a date. It turns out, however, that Mana is one of three test pilots for the TRIDENT (alternatively named the \"Country Crawler\") units, a new competitor to the Evangelions, similar to Jet Alone; thus the name Girlfriend of Steel. Eventually, the TRIDENT goes berserk and the Evas have to destroy it. \n \nThe interactivity in most of the game is limited to walking around areas until the next plot event is triggered. However, the one true branch occurs at the end of the game, where the player may choose to focus on Mana, Asuka or Kaji. This choice determines which of the game's three endings are shown, with a fourth exclusive to the PS2. \n \nIn the Mana ending, Mana is discovered not to have been killed in the battle. Shinji rescues her and brings her back to his apartment. She showers, emerges wearing only a towel, and teasingly asks Shinji if he would like her to remove it (which she eventually does). In discussion with Misato, however, it is agreed that Mana has to leave Tokyo-3, and she says a teary goodbye to Shinji who has won her heart. \n \nIn the Asuka ending, Asuka helps Shinji to get over Mana and the two children grow closer as a result. This ending contains romantic images of Asuka and Shinji together, including a moving scene where Asuka hugs Shinji emotionally. \n \nThe third ending with Kaji does not focus on any one character as much as the other endings do. Mana is also discovered not to be killed, and says goodbye, with Shinji replying \"I'll be waiting for you\".","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wlv.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":19666,"name":"Burning Rangers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sonic Team brings you the fire fighting heroes of the future...
