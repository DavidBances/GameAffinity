Fearing for their future, the project's head scientist, Hiodoshi, escaped with the two prototypes to a nearby kingdom, but time after were found by Shinra's troops and Hiodoshi was killed by the attack of the imperial army, the power of the galuda has awaken.\n\nYou have the option of controlling one of two siblings each with different skills, Ageha faster but with narrower shooting capabilities or Tateha slower but with a wider attack. As you fly through the various stages various mechanical enemies attack with a high number of bullets, often nearly filling the screen. Aside from the regular shots, Ageha and Tateha also have additional abilities which help the player navigate through the numerous bullets. The first is a guard barrier; when activated the player is immune to collisions and as a bonus when the barrier button is released a more powerful laser shot is fired. A meter at the bottom of the screen indicates how much power is left in the barrier. The second ability is called the Kakusei mode; when this mode is activated your character gender is altered and is able to fire a more powerful shot. More importantly, when this mode is activated all of the enemies and their bullets slow down considerably while the players speed remains the same making it easier to navigate through a tricky pattern of bullets. Activating Kakusei mode will rapidly deplete the players supply of green gems; since the number of gems isn't limitless the player may not be able to remain in Kakusei mode for long. When not in Kakusei mode additional gems can be collected by destroying the various enemies. If the player completely runs out of gems, enemy bullets begin travelling faster than usual. Another bonus in the game is gold inguts which greatly increase the players score. These are found when in Kakusei mode; when an enemy is destroyed, all of its bullets will turn into ingots which can be collected by the player.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27ks.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"AMI","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"CAVE Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arika Co., Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":83809,"name":"Galactic Civilizations III: Intrigue","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Assemble your cabinet of advisors, choose a form of government, and earn the trust and faith of your people.

A young apprentice of Xerxes gets the opportunity to leave the peasant life and take a stab at gold and glory by challenging mythical figures and gods. The gameplay is based on anagrams. Games start with a mix of six letters used to construct words of different length. Letters are selected by moving an arrow-shaped cursor. When a word is formed, points are awarded, a meter fills up, and new letters appear on the tablet.\n\nNext to the story mode, the three game modes can also be played in the Quickplay mode:\nClassical: find as many words of different length as you can before time elapses.\n6-Letter Challenge: find the 6 letter word in a given number of tries.\nEvolution: find words of specific length before time runs out.\nWhile playing, players can earn bonuses that provide additional time or freeze it, guess a word for the player, or shuffle the letters. The player can also receive penalties from his opponent. These empty the bonus gauge, mirror the letters or even hide them. Bonuses become available by discovering the six-letter word multiple times, and penalties arrive when it takes too long to form a word.\n\nThere is a high score screen for each mode and a tutorial explaining the basics. The game offers sound effects and music, along with an overview map in the quest mode, and pre-game screens where the opponents offer some pearls of wisdom.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mgq.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gameloft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":83914,"name":"The Heist mobile","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":83915,"name":"Myths of the World: Behind the Veil - Collector's Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It’s Dia de los Muertos, and you’re heading home to celebrate!

It is set on the continent of Corondor, where a planeswalker named Ravidel forces the most powerful mages to fight each other, so that he can eventually destroy them and conquer the land. The game had a poor critical reception due to its unfair AI, unfriendly interface, and unbalanced gameplay.[citation needed]\n\nSpectrum Holobyte filed a lawsuit after Acclaim published the PC version in January 1997, claiming Acclaim had violated an agreement the two companies made in November 1996 which established a release schedule for the game, with the two companies publishing it for different platforms.
