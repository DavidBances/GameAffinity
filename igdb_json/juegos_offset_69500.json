His specials tap into his Devil Gene with moves like the beam-shooting Devil Blaster and high-flying Devil Wings. The son of Tekken icon Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya has a chip on his shoulder and destructive power.\n\nWhat makes Kazuya Mishima unique in this game are his standard attacks—rather than 4 directional standard attacks, he has 8. This addition of diagonal inputs mimics his abilities in the Tekken games and make him an unpredictable fighter with a lot of combo options. The stage added with this fighter is the Mishima Dojo, which starts out with all four directions closed off.
