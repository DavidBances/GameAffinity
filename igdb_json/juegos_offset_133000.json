It is known primarily for being composed of short, fairly straightforward levels, a possible progenitor of Erik Alm's Scythe.\n\nDemonfear is a compilation of small episodes released by Windsor between 1995 and 1999, known otherwise as Demonfear 1-6. An early, alternate version of Demonfear 6 was partially complete in 1997, but Windsor donated the maps to Requiem when the project had stagnated due to a handful of authors failing to provide maps for slots they had claimed. The compiler dropped Windsor's levels into the previously vacant slots so that his old Demonfear 6 MAP26, 27, and 28 appear as Requiem's MAP20, 26, and 25, respectively. Windsor would go on to create a new Demonfear 6 and then compile his own megawad.\n\nDemonfear comes with a text file that describes in detail the story of the megawad on a level-by-level basis. The plot involves another surprise demon invasion of Earth; mirroring the action of Doom II, the protagonist travels through various military complexes and into a city, eventually entering Hell itself in what is apparently a twisted facsimile of the normal world.\n\nIn 2019, Doomworld user P41R47 made a MIDI pack for Demonfear, which also includes miscellaneous enhancements for the intermission, text screens, and ending.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4n49.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Adam Winsor","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":144408,"name":"Twilight Warrior","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Twilight Warrior is a tactical military Doom II total conversion created by Black Shadow Software that requires source port Doom Legacy.
