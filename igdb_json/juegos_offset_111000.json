At the end of the corrido, Juan picks Maria Blanca as his preferred wife, while the other two women became the wives of Juan's brothers, Pedro and Diego. All three women had interesting backgrounds, but the way they were treated in the story left something to be desired. This is a manuscript that is often discussed in Filipino literature classes, but the portrayal of women — either as damsels in distress or prizes to be chosen — are not empowering. \n \nAdarna: The Legend of Maria Blanca re-imagines what it would be like if these princesses' lives did not revolve around Juan or his brothers. Many regions of pre-Hispanic Philippines had matriarchal societies, and while the first Adarna game released by Senshi.Labs had a very Western feel to it, this sequel attempts to transport the players back to an indigeous pre-colonial atmosphere while keeping the language somewhat up to date. \n \nThis adventure starts off in the Kingdom of Reinos de los Kristales, where the Princess Maria Blanca learns that her sister Isabela has fallen ill. A hermit approaches Maria to inform her that Isabela can only be cured by the mythical creature of Adarna.

Powered by a massive 5-liter V8 engine and delivering more than 428hp of power and 528 Nm of torque, buyers can choose between a full manual and automatic six-speed gearbox, the latter coming with genuine shifting paddles – a first in the long history of the Mustang.\n\nBased on the Porsche 911 3.2, the 1987 CTR Yellowbird is one of Ruf’s most iconic models that has helped build Ruf's reputation for building no-compromise sports cars. The 3.4 liter twin-turbocharged flat six engine provided 469hp from two large turbo chargers & intercoolers and had been equipped with a new Bosch Motronic as well as an ignition setup originally designed for Porsche’s 962 Group C race car. Thanks to extensive weight-saving measures such as usage of fiberglass and aluminum, the CTR weighs just 1150 kilograms, resulting in a very impressive performance.\n\nBMW's 2002 Turbo road car made the history books in 1973 by becoming Europe's first-ever mass-produced road car powered by a turbocharged engine. The 2002 Turbo's two-liter four cylinder engine provided 170hp of power, a figure that made the 2002 one of the most powerful cars on the road during its time. Unfortunately, the 1974 oil crisis forced an end to the 2002 Turbo's production after just one year as gas prices were soaring across the world. Only 1672 cars were produced during the model's limited production run, making the 2002 Turbo one of BMW's most iconic and most sought-after classics.\nBuilt to the Super 2000 touring car regulations, the 320TC is BMW's weapon of choice for competition in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) and countless national touring car series around the globe.\nWeighing 1170 kilograms, the car is powered by a 1.6 litreDI-turbo four-cylinder engine and a full adjustable six-speed sequential gearbox. Driven by veteran touring car aces such as Tom Coronel, Franz Engstler & Stefano D'Aste, the 320TC clinched five world championship wins.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co834o.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Slightly Mad Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120195,"name":"Project CARS: Modified Car Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Add three limited-run custom machines to your garage with the Modified Car Pack – the Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster, Ariel Atom 3 Mugen, and the all-new Ruf CTR3 SMS-R…\n\nWith only five chassis ever built, the Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster is an open-top hypercar with a monstrous top speed, racecar levels of downforce, and extravagant beauty to match its multi-million dollar price tag.\n\nCreated in celebration of the ten year anniversary of the original ground-breaking track racer, the Ariel Atom 3 takes just 2.9 seconds to go from 0-60.\n\nFurther blurring the lines between reality and gaming, the Ruf CTR3 SMS-R is the result of a collaboration between veteran developers Slightly Mad Studios and Ruf to make a race-spec version of the already-impressive CTR3 super sports car.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co834n.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Slightly Mad Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120196,"name":"Project CARS: Audi Ruapuna Speedway Expansion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The first Track Expansion for Project CARS includes Prototype and GT cars from Audi, and a new location to race at: New Zealand motor racing circuit Ruapuna Park…\n\n- Ruapuna Park GP\n-Ruapuna Park Club\n- Ruapuna Park Outer Loop\n- Ruapuna Park A Circuit\n- Ruapuna Park B Circuit\n- Audi R8 LMP900\n- Audi R18 e-tron Quattro\n- Audi 90 IMSA GTO","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co834i.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Slightly Mad Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120197,"name":"Project CARS: Racing Icons Car Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Expand your Prototype and GT rosters with two uncompromising and beautiful machines from the prestigious heritage of Bentley – the Speed 8 and Continental GT3 - and three further racing icons: the Le Mans-winning BMW V12 LMR and McLaren F1 GTR, and the Mercedes-Benz CLK LM.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co834m.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Slightly Mad Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120199,"name":"Cyberpunk: The Arasaka's Plot","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cyberpunk: The Arasaka's Plot is a mobile game based on Mike Pondsmith's pen and paper RPG Cyberpunk.
