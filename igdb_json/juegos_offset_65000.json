Immediately afterwards he receives a call from his ex-girlfriend, who tells him a girl has been kidnapped, and sends him a picture of that girl. To his astonishment, Kojiroh realizes this is the very same girl he just saw on the street... Meanwhile, Marina encounters a young man who jumps from the roof of a high building in front of her eyes.

Disowned by his own father and forced to make his way in life, he chooses to become a Hunter, a mercenary who accepts jobs for a variety of adventures. Heading into town to officially join the Hunter’s Guild with his dragon Shell at his side, he happens across a mysterious girl who looks strikingly like the Moon Goddess.\n\nThe Moon Goddess... Ever since he was young, a beautiful girl appears before him on nights of a full moon. Because of the mysterious manner of her appearance, he gave her a unique name. With the mysterious girl Alicia and dragon Shell at his side, as well as new characters he will join with later, our hero embarks on many bold adventures.
