As soon as the column of at least 5 blocks of the same type gathers together, this group annihilates, freeing up space on the playfield, thus making it possible to continue the game.\n\nDrop-Drop was initially developed and published in Russia; the only known names attached to the project are programmers Vladimir Ryshov and Grigory Sragovich. The game was included in the Moscow Nights game compilation, which released in (at the very least) the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nData East learned of Moscow Knights and obtained a license for Drop-Drop, using it as the basis of what would eventually be known as Magical Drop.
