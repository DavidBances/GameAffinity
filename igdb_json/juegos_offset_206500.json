Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority. The battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares. Battles are displayed as animated sequences on a separate screen, their outcome calculated according to the unit's properties and parameters.
