In this sequel, the level starts over if the player gets killed before all the enemies have come in. When all enemies are killed, the player moves on to the next level.

Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the passage that he wishes to unlock. As usual, ghosts will keep chasing Pac around the maze until he has lost all his lives. However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the ghosts quickly.\n\nThere are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only last for a number of seconds. During the time that he is enlarged, a flashing star will appear besides two boxes that are located in the middle of the maze. The first box will display the current fruit or prize, and the other will display a rotating selection of them. If Pac manages to eat the star when they match there will be a large bonus score.\n\nOccasionally, after three or more stages, there will be a bonus stage where Pac automatically gets enlarged. The object of these stages is to eat everything in the maze before the time runs out and, during these stages, there will be no ghosts to pursue him.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4ta6.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Beam Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bally Midway","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":21682,"name":"Pipe Mania","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pipe Mania is a puzzle game where players must place random tiles in order to help water flow to its destiny.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co728i.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Empire Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":21683,"name":"Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this original and adult psychological survival horror, the masked protagonist must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means necessary.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gye.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Curve Digital","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Jasper Byrne","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Superflat Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":21684,"name":"Light in the Dark","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Light in the Dark is a physics puzzle game for mobile devices from Dreamgate Studios.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/inelxhna3nm2xyu9jixo.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":21685,"name":"Pain: Amusement Park","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":21686,"name":"Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Apocalypse","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Apocalypse is the fourth and final downloadable content package available for Call of Duty: Black Ops II.

In the game, the player controls two green men who carry a cannon, as they defend the king below them from getting abducted by the balloons above, which keep invading the lower part of the screen while also shooting projectiles. Once all the balloons are shot down, the game moves on to the next level.\n\nOne thing that makes King & Balloon unique is that you don't lose a life when hit. Rather, you respawn and keep on playing. The only way to lose a life is letting the king get abducted. Another interesting mechanic of note is that the balloons stop attacking and descending when one grabs ahold of the king, and they will keep still until the king is back on the ground. This creates a risk versus reward mechanic and entices you to let the balloon carry the king high enough so you can take out more balloons, then rescuing the king just in time.\n\nKing & Balloon was also one of the first games to have speech, and it still holds up better than most contemporary or even later examples. The king says \"Help!\" when abducted, \"Thank You!\" when rescued, and \"Bye bye!\" when he leaves the screen. There are actually different voices for the game in Japan and the US version, with the Japan version having a slight Japanese accent.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/guf3mn3c3hf6asnwzqc5.jpg","releaseYear":1980,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"GamePlan","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":21690,"name":"Hero of Sparta","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Take up the fiercest challenge and fight from the Oracle's island to the summit of Olympus.

You play as a hero accompanied by a witch taking on the evil Medusa, whom has destroyed many villages and towns with the monsters that stand before her.\n\nMedusa turned the witch into stone, so she is no longer able to move. So it’s up to the hero to defeat the monsters and collect their blood in order to recover the witch for a limited duration. The witch’s destructive magic easily destroys monsters, but you will have to rely on the hero’s willpower primarily. He is able to try and try again, but the witch cannot, thus the hero must protect her.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co261u.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CIRCLE Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"F K Digital Pty Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":21925,"name":"Witch & Hero 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Witch and Hero 2 is an action game that controls both little witch and little hero at the same time.\n\nTo save the lost witch and hero from the demon lord, the little witch and little hero get to fight again!\n\nWitch and Hero 2 is an action game that controls both little witch and little hero at the same time.\n\nThe little hero is physically strong and stands up forever no matter how many times he's beaten.
