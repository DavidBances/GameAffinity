The game is neither a remake nor a sequel to the original King's Bounty, but rather it expands on the ideas of its inspiration while adding new, unique elements. Custom EGA graphics that had been made for King's Bounty 2 often draw inspiration from Russian/Slavic folk tales. \n \nThe game isn't shy of its rather clichéd plot. An evil wizard has stolen an important MacGuffin (which isn't even named) from the King, and hid it away in the Dark Castle on a lost continent. The player, taking the role of the King's trusted knight, must find the castle, defeat the wizard and bring the artifact back. Before this can be done however, the continent where the Dark Castle is located must be found. To this end, the player must find five pieces of an ancient map that have been scattered across other continents. Each continent's Lord of the Land might help obtaining a piece of the map, but will request a favour or two in return, and there are other quests to complete on each continent as well. \n \nKing's Bounty 2 was supposed to be split into two parts, with the first concerning the search for the map pieces, and the second would take place on the lost continent. However, apparently only the first part was completed and released to the public. The game had been a free, non-commercial project from the start, so splitting it into parts was not done as a step towards the shareware model, but rather because of free time considerations. \n \nThe game retains many familiar elements from King's Bounty. The player roams the land, buys supplies in towns, hires troops, finds treasure chests, and gets contracts to capture castles in order to earn money and reputation to maintain a large, loyal fighting force. Additionally, the player can buy and sell different goods in towns for a profit, and hire workers to help clear the various terrain obstacles (thus, woodcutters can clear forests, carpenters build bridges over water, stonecutters lay passages through mountains). While there are no player classes in the game, spells can be either found in chests and scrolls, or bought in some of the towns to be used at any time. However, to use magic effectively the player must find a benevolent wizard whose training increases the player's spell power. \n \nThe most common enemies in the game are local feudal lords who are initially neutral to the player but will start chasing and eventually attack when get annoyed by the player's trespassing on their premises. Both the player's and the enemies' armies may consist of a wide variety of creatures, including peasants, mercenaries, soldiers and animals, as well as magical creatures and undead. Each continent has a number of creature dwellings where units can be hired into the player's army. Siege weapons are bought in towns, just like in King's Bounty. Other than direct combat, there are encounters with evil warlocks that can cause trouble for the player, and negative spells in some of the scrolls. \n \nA unique feature of King's Bounty 2 is that it uses a random map generator to create a new world each time it is played. There are four difficulty settings, the first three of which are progressively more difficult \"training\" modes, while the fourth is considered to be the real playing experience. Only the fourth difficulty level was supposed to unlock the lost continent and the final battle with the wizard.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xpgk6hyhq5n6oisup0fj.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":74173,"name":"Kuài Dǎ Chuánshuō","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Chinese fighting game often subtitled \"Street Fighter IV\" in some releases.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7t3a.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":73986,"name":"Solar Winds: Galaxy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sequel to Solar Winds: The Escape, you play the role of Jake Stone, a bounty hunter seeking to save his people from destruction.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pba.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":73839,"name":"Skunny: Save Our Pizzas!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/isqsccajvpz9ygxtmibd.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":73826,"name":"Zone 66","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A pilot is warned by a mysterious stranger that something terrible is about to happen in his town.

The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him.

You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase.\n\nBefore each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don't give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples).\n\nMissions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield.\n\nUnusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.\nThe game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.\nSince its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\".","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2rpc.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":11101,"name":"Battle Isle Data Disk II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dmno514o14gnrquwv53x.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":11046,"name":"Terror of the Catacombs","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Catacomb Apocalypse is the final game in the Catacomb Adventure Series.
