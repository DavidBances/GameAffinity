Zombies 2: About Time. It was created by goodpea2 in collaboration with Mine Power and makes numerous changes in order to bring things more in line with what many fans loved about the original.

The mod not only fixes problems with the game, but also makes it incredibly challenging - this is not a fault, but an intentional change for the appeal of those who have mastered the original game and desire more of a challenge, with a much greater emphasis on strategy. This may put off some players used to the usual skill level required of players from other games in the series.\n\nUltimately, the mod is a challenging and impressive overhaul which bares very little resemblance to the original PvZ2 game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4uoy.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mine Power","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"goodpea2","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":128013,"name":"I got a cat maid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You pick up a cat maid to live together and have physical intimacies in this mini-game. 3 H scenes with 18 variations.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co43g9.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CatBellUnion","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":110994,"name":"Spiral Clicker","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Spiral Clicker is a clicker style game in which a mysterious elf with absolutely no ulterior motives whatsoever has given you access to a magical spiral that can drain your willpower and turn it into energy you can use to build your dream harem out of the girls at your local college.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ksj.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Changer","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":108415,"name":"Koi Solitaire","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Use your solitaire skills to build gorgeous gardens in this relaxing Card & Board game!","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":108399,"name":"Danger Room VR","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Danger Room is a short and frenetic VR game.
