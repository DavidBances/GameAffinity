It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII.\n\nKingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tpy.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix Creative Business Unit I","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Disney Interactive Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Square Enix Business Division 3","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":287554,"name":"King Drift and hajwalah","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7s7w.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":271198,"name":"37th Relic Retrieval","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Huge nonlinear IKbase level with over 900 enemies.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co77oi.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":269117,"name":"Concrete Rage","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"One fairly detailed tech base which started its life as nothing too serious, but grew into a medium sized tech base.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":260478,"name":"Retro Mystery Club Vol.1: The Ise-Shima Case","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This classic-style mystery adventure game, inspired by the Famicom Detective Club series and illustrated by Famitsu's legend Kiyokazu Arai, will take you on a suspenseful journey through the beautiful landscapes of Ise-Shima.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6zuk.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Shinyuden","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Happymeal Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Undercoders","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":218535,"name":"Old Site","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Old Site is a mod of Celeste Classic using ideas from the chapter \"Old Site\" from the game's full release, Celeste.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5bi7.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Amegpo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":209282,"name":"FR3DD-Y2 p1223-R1a","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"FR3DD-Y2 p1223-R1a is a visual novel FNaF x VA11 Hall-A fangame, created for the Fangames at Freddit's gamejam event.\n\nYou play as a potential new pizza-tender for Freddy's Pizzeria going through your first day on the job; getting used to the restaurant and its odd staff, cooking various types of pizza to serve to hungry customers, and having inane conversations with whoever sits in front of your station.
