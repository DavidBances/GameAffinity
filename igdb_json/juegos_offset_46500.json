It is based on Doom3D, though rewritten for OpenGL rather than DirectX, and including some bug fixes from Boom and MBF. It aims to recreate the look and feel of Doom 64 as closely as possible, based on specifications obtained through reverse engineering, similarly to how Kaiser also created SvStrife.\n\nThe first public version of Doom64 EX was released on July 10, 2008.\n\nCompared to the Doom 64: Absolution TC, the principal difference is that Doom64 EX uses the original data. A tool provided with the port can create a DOOM64.WAD IWAD from the ROM.\n\nDoom 64 plays almost identically to earlier games in the Doom series; the player must advance through numerous levels fighting demons, collecting weapons and keys and hitting switches in order to reach the level's exit while surviving deadly traps and ambushes. Changes were made to the Doom engine for use in Doom 64, and gameplay elements were altered.\n\nWeapons\nAll the weapons from the original game are present, but redrawn with new sprites. The chainsaw was given two blades instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves on instead of brass knuckles, the plasma rifle has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back a bit, the shotgun's reloading cock is at the handle instead of under the barrel and the Super Shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil.\n\nA new weapon known as the Laser, or \"Unmaker\", was added, using the same cell ammunition as the plasma rifle and BFG. It was first mentioned in the Doom Bible and was planned to be featured in the PC Doom games but never appeared. Its appearance in Doom 64 is its only official appearance. With the power of three ancient artifacts found in the game, it becomes more powerful by shooting three laser beams (at a quicker rate than default) instead of one. The first artifact increases the laser speed, the second artifact adds a second laser and the third artifact allows the weapon to fire three simultaneous lasers which can automatically aim separately from one another, allowing the weapon to attack three different enemies at once.\n\nPlot\nFollowing the conclusion of the original Doom series, the sole Marine who survived the horrors of hell had returned to Earth, reclaiming it from the invasion that almost eradicated the human race. Demons still lingered within the abandoned halls and complexes of Phobos and Deimos. As a last-ditch effort, the military decided to bombard the moons with extreme radiation in hopes of killing off any remaining demons. Initially it was successful, however something survived the exposure. The radiation blocked the military's sensors and allowed something to slip past them undetected. This mysterious entity, possessing the ability to resurrect any demon it came across, recreated the entire demonic horde and made it stronger than ever before. A Marine strike force was ordered to contain the advancing armies of hell but was mercilessly slaughtered within moments. The player's character is the sole survivor of this group.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jmi.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Samuel Villarreal","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50251,"name":"Archage","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"ArcheAge is a MMORPG based on Eastern and Western fantasy world view.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50252,"name":"Get Lost!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Attempt to find exits in mazes in this first person 3d maze game from Tom Bombadil's Software Emporium & House of Curiosities.

But one day, their land was attacked, and the talisman stolen. A brave warrior went out to investigate the talisman's disappearance, but returned mortally wounded. Before he died, he told his three sons that the talisman was stolen by the evil Necromancer, and must be retrieved at all costs... \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is a role-playing game in which the player can assume control of any of the three brothers - Julian, Philip, or Kevin. Each of the three has his own strengths: Julian is the archetypal melee fighter, Philip has high luck and intelligence, while Kevin is known for his kindness. Should the player fail while controlling one of the brothers, the next one will replace him. Each brother will be revived a few times when vanquished by an enemy, until his luck runs out, at which point he will die permanently. \n \nMuch of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring the large world, interacting with non-playable characters and building up the brothers' combat abilities by participating in battles. The fastest-growing parameter is bravery, which is comparable to experience points and strength combined. Each defeated enemy yields bravery points; as it grows, so does the hero's vitality (maximum hit points), albeit at a slower rate. Combat system is rather simple and is done in action style, with the player pressing a key or a mouse button while navigating the protagonist towards or away from the enemy. Predating Ultima V, the game has a day and night cycle, and the main character has to eat and rest. \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is notable for having a very vast world, usually considered the largest ever created for a video game at the time of its release. Players can explore approximately 17,000 screens of terrain. The world is also interconnected, i.e. there are no transitions between different types of areas. Items can be dropped by enemies as well as found anywhere in the game's world. There is also NPC interaction and quests the protagonist can undertake.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fqnqeorkpug2yob8kysy.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50277,"name":"Don't Go Alone","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Don't Go Alone is a horror role-playing game.\n\nThe player can choose their party from a variety of 16 paranormal characters available.

Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast.

Players not only control the combat units (ranging from infantry and tanks to helicopters, fighters and bombers, armored trains, surface warships and submarines, stationary gun turrets), but (especially in the later games) also many support logistics units (ammo and fuel transports, scout and radar units, road and construction vehicles, and others). Units have various weapons and can gain experience (which in later games can be transferred over in a campaign). Fuel and ammo is limited, and logistics require careful attention. Players also control buildings, where units can be repaired, and sometimes, produced. Weather conditions change, affecting unit movements (for example, a sea or river can freeze, immobilizing ships but allowing light units to move through it). Fog of war is prevalent and players have to use scouting units to gain information about the battlefield. Some of those options were added in expansions or sequels. \n \nPlayers have various tasks, ranging from eliminating all opponent forces to capturing specific buildings or protecting certain units or places. In some missions events from outside the battlefield can suddenly change the situation, giving players new objectives, reinforcements, allies or enemies. In some battles there are more than two sides, each with their own objectives, not all of them directly involved in hostilities - some of them can be even allied. At the same time, those allegiances can change because of some events or actions. \n \nBattle Isle one had the screen divided into two parts, one for each player. The turns were also divided into move and attack phases. While one player moved his units, the other commanded his own troops to carry out his actions. Battle Isle 2 gave the player the entire screen, and merged move and attack phases, and introduced the 3-D display of combat. Battle Isle 3 was very similar to Battle Isle 2, with improved graphics, more units and a new storyline. Battle Isle: The Andosian War was entirely set in the 3-D environment and combined elements of real-time and turn-based strategies. \n \nThe AI is relatively weak, relying on mass frontal assaults. After a player survives the first few turns and the AI's overwhelming numbers using protected artillery and terrain advantage, the computer is usually unable to mount a proper defense.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50410,"name":"London Underground Simulator - World of Subways Vol.3","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"World of Subways\" is our series of the most interesting Subway and Underground routes of the world for the PC.

Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first \"ecosim\", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject.\n\nSim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems.\n\nContrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success.\n\nBalance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load \"biased\" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5xjn.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50500,"name":"Adventures of Maddog Williams in the Dungeons of Duridian","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player takes the role of Maddog Williams who wants to rescue the beautiful Princess Leoria and free her father King Thaylor.

The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game's 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O'Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game's release.\n\nThe management side of O'Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team.\n\nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Denílson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning.\n\nThe club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team.\n\nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/p26lapqrmna33r2qkz5p.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":50551,"name":"Robot Ponkottsu Star Version","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Robot Ponkottsu: Moon Version is a Role-Playing game, published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1999.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8kyx.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Red Company","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":50552,"name":"Othello Millennium","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Othello Millennium is a board game developed by Tomcat System and published by Tsukuda Original for the Game Boy Color platform.

As Conan and the others opened the Togawa sisters' request, they decided to help uncover the mystery behind their lineage and golden statue and set off on a trip to the solitary island in question where ships travel to only twice a week. As they arrive on the island of strange shape, the notice the residents of an island village appear a bit weird, and there seem to be history behind the wealthy island family. And to top it all, the murder in front of the wealthy looking western-style estate occurred just in front on them and the murderer ran away from the scene of the crime.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.\n\nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.\n\nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.\n\nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.\n\nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.\n\nKnockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.\n\nAfter Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5yoh.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EA Sports","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}]},{"id":50574,"name":"Hudson Selection Vol. 4: Takahashi Meijin no Bouken-jima","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Takahashi Meijin 3D conversion!

At this time, the game already was completely finished.\n\nIn Bound High!, Chalvo, the bouncing robot, travels through space In full 3d-D motion in pursuit of alien invaders that threaten the peaceful inhabitants of Earth. Angling from above, players control rolled up Chalvo, who must destroy all enemies on the playfield by landing on them and throwing them down from the playfield. Falling off the playfield himself, Chalvo will loose a life.\nThe playfield is in space, or high above the earth, and is made of many little squares, which are composed differently from level to level, once big plain areas, once many small, scattered blocks. Bouncing over the platforms can be quite incalculable and dangerous, while some are solid, other ones vanish after one hit or reveal puzzles, items or other objects and besides a lot of different enemies, Chalvo also has to carefully avoid winds, the deep crevices, sharp spikes and highly charged electric \"shockers\" that cause his demise. Adding to the difficulty is the rebound angle when you hit a moving enemy - you don't necessarily bounce straight up in the air.\nSometimes blocks lead to an \"Another Stage\", some kind of mirrored parallel universe with inverted colors and without the dangerous winds.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6qql.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Japan System Supply","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Virtual Boy"}]},{"id":50597,"name":"Virtual Fishing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Virtual Fishing is a Sports game, developed by Locomotive Corporation and published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1995.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ivx.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Locomotive Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Pack-In-Video","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Virtual Boy"}]},{"id":50598,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Limited Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Forget everything you know about The Legend of Zelda games.

Similar to gaining new specials in crisis mode as of the first Revolution game and beforehand Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 3, the Senzai Ninriki is a special crisis mode that provides certain effects depending on the character, for example Naruto and Temari's backward strong attacks no longer use up chakra, Hinata can chakra cancel her attacks with no chakra cost, Kakashi deals damage through guard with all his attacks, Neji and Gaara automatically deflect projectiles while standing still, certain characters' moves become unblockable and so on. Most of the characters' Senzai Ninriki effects change in Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 onwards.\nOne of the game's new modes is the \"Hurricane Clash Mode\", which is also reworked into the new story mode which is original from the main storyline. In this mode, the player controls their character in a full 3D movement perspective and can take on hordes of ninja in a beat em' up genre fashion, with many character movesets retweaked solely for this mode. This style has not appeared in any later Gekitou Ninja Taisen/Clash of Ninja games ever since.\nThis game was released only in Japan.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3gdl.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":50730,"name":"Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Play as all 13 Kamen Riders from the Kamen Rider Dragon Knight TV series, each with their own unique Contract Beasts, Advent cards, and special abilities.
