His talent makes him a quite important member of his local community, the Gap village. He serves as the villages' liaison to King Trent the ruler of the lands of Xanth, who resides in castle Roogna. Mim regularly corresponds with the King discussing various matters.

For some reason, the development stopped, so we have only a single background, a single BG music (though it's quite a good one), no endings (not even some credits rolling), practically not configurable keyboard controls (you can only change functions between the predefined keys) and no difficulty levels - the only way to get an easier challenge is reducing the other player's energy in the options screen. There should even be a secret character named Sayuri, but... There are no files related to her...\n\nThe rest, however, makes up greatly for these lacks. The nine characters are well-done in every aspect: good characterization (and don't forget their portraits in the selection and VS screen: beautiful), great and fluid animations, many special moves with a lot of spectacular graphic effects. Each one is available in eight different color palettes, and there's even a secret menu in the options to edit them! The most powerful moves require the pressure of two attack keys together, and for this reason there are four shortcut keys too. I had many problems with the standard layout, which forces the player to use the left hand to move, until I found out that the \"Dolphin-Mode\" option enables another keyboard layout (see the reference card). There are no more shortcut keys for easier super moves this way, but it isn't a big deal since the keystrokes detection is always flawless - in fact, I hardly ever used the shortcuts even in normal mode :) Fast, fun gameplay and combative AI ensure a good challenge for a game that, if brought to 100% completion, would rival many commercial productions in quality. If you like fighting games, however, don't miss it in any case.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ccr.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Inudon Empire","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":135647,"name":"Frenzy!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Frenzy! features non-stop mayhem as you swoop, dive and bomb your way to the skies and ultimate glory over nine action packed levels!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2cct.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":135648,"name":"Family Bowling","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Released in 1998 as Family Bowling for the Playstation.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ccv.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nichibutsu","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":135649,"name":"Super Holobunnies: Pause Café","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Holobunnies (a group of hologram bunnies) pass the time on their sweet little home planet by battling each other to see who's the strongest in Brawler mode.
