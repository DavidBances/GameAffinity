Now, rumors are spreading of new, ungodly creatures fighting with Heishi warriors, even without the powers of Amahagane. Yoshitsune and his companions must draw their weapons again, and with the new strength given to them by the Amahagane, defeat the new evil to save all of Japan.\n\nGenji: Days of the Blade, sequel to the PlayStation 2 game Genji: Dawn of the Samurai, is an action game, based in ancient/feudal Japan, in which you must defeat a new, mysterious source of evil to save your country. You control one of four characters (changeable in real-time), each with their own weapons, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nYoshitsune Minamoto and Benkei Musashibo, the main characters of the previous game, join with Gozen Shizuka and Lord Buson to complete their quest. Yoshitsune is a young warrior who wields a katana in each hand, Benkei is a mighty warrior-monk who uses a war club and a naginata for weapons. Shizuka is a nimble priestess who is adept with chained blades, and Buson is a God of War from the Overworld who carries a double saber and can use supernatural powers.\n\nThe game play involves fighting many enemies and bosses with regular attacks, combo attacks, and Kamui. Kamui is a power that you can use to summon a magical space around you in which you unleash multiple special attacks on surrounding enemies by pressing buttons in series as they appear on the screen. Your Kamui bar fills as you land successful hits on opponents. The characters travel through both levels based on real locations in Japan and fantasy locations, defeating everything from regular Heishi warriors to giant, mutated enemy crabs. The level design involves platformer elements and solving small puzzles, such as destroying Masho flowers scattered throughout an area to open a door.\n\nThe game also has RPG elements; you collect Amahagane and Mashogane hidden around levels and from fallen enemies. They can be used to augment character stats and weapon attack power, respectively. You can also find new weapons and items such as herbs with healing properties, or scrolls that give you attack bonuses for a period of time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2902.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Republic Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":7316,"name":"Gran Turismo 6","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gran Turismo 6 is a racing video game and the sixth major release and twelfth game overall in the Gran Turismo video game series.

The game was released as a largely unfinished product and many parts of it do not work properly at all.\n\nThe packaging of Big Rigs states that the main objective of the game is to race a semi-trailer truck (known colloquially as a \"big rig\") in order to safely deliver illegal cargo being carried by the vehicle, while avoiding the local police force. In actuality, there are no police in the game, no such objectives are presented within the game itself and there is no load attached to the truck.[1] Much of the game instead centers on the player racing their truck against fellow drivers to the finish line; however, in the earlier versions the player's computer-controlled opponent vehicles have no AI and never move from the starting position. In a later version, the computer-controlled opponent will race around the track, but will stop just before crossing the finish line. The timer in the game is merely aesthetic and has no limit on the gameplay. In addition, due to a lack of collision detection, there are no obstacles to navigate within the game, and the player is able to phase through environments and leave the game altogether.\n\nBig Rigs: Over the Road Racing was critically panned. The game's criticism is largely directed at its \"blatantly unfinished\"[2] state: lack of collision detection and frequent violation of the laws of physics, frequent and major software bugs, poor visuals, and severe lack of functionality. As a result, the game is now widely regarded as one of the worst video games of all time","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co21x9.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"GameMill Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Stellar Stone","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":7558,"name":"Ninja Gaiden","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ninja Action!

It was originally planned as a first-person game for the PlayStation 3's motion controller PlayStation Move, but the motion controls were later dropped when it became a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.\n\nUntil Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \"Butterfly Effect\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \"hundreds of endings\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.\n\nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2s5q.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Supermassive Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":7610,"name":"Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Game of Thrones: A TellTale Games Series is an episodic adventure game developed by TellTale Games and based on the famous HBO TV-show Game of Thrones, as well as the book 'A song of Ice and Fire' by George R.R.

With this vital data, adapt your car to each unique track by adjusting gear ratio, transmission, spoiler angle and tire stagger. Depending on whether you're racing or qualifying for pole position, you must also decide which type of engine to use. But \"dial in\" your car carefully. One miscalculation could send you reeling into the wall.\n\nWhen you think you have the right stuff, drop the hammer on NASCAR's finest field of racers- including Bill Elliott himself- in single races or compete for the Cup in the Championship Season.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5akz.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"GameTek, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Distinctive Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":7786,"name":"Bionic Commando","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The original arcade game was advertised in the United States as a sequel to Commando, going as far to refer to the game's main character as Super Joe (the protagonist of Commando) in the promotional brochure, who was originally an unnamed member of a \"special commando unit\" in the Japanese and World versions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4ih4.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Capcom","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Minakuchi Engineering","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":7787,"name":"Black Bass: Lure Fishing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"There are only two lakes to fish at and a limited set of lures; unlike the Super NES video game Super Black Bass.

You can also choose from three difficulty levels - Junior, College and Pro.\nThroughout the game, you'll constantly be tested by every intense element of championship hockey, from Penalty and Overtime Scenes to Knockout Smash-Hit Fight Scenes. Speed, strength, quickness and instinct are talents you must possess if you plan to prevail, especially when the anger flares, gloves come off and fists start flying.\n\nIt's hard hitting action at its toughest. And you'll soon learn that in this league nothing's ever given to you, and before you can reach your goals - you have to score them. You've gotta master the artful skill of a finesse player and the bone crushing brutality of an enforcer. You'd better be versatile as well, because you must skillfully control your forwards, centers, defensemen and even the goalie, who'll defend the net against unrelenting Power Plays (which will occur if you lose a fight and have your battered carcass banned to the Penalty Box).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7jfu.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":7789,"name":"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a top down, procedurally-generated roguelike game, remade based on the original game The Binding of Isaac.
