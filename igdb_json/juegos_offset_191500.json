Might and Magic 3: Isles of Terra. Terra awaits you. Prepare to be charmed by its magic and tested by its mighty power. Lead a party of adventurers to rendezvous with the legendary wizard, Corak. From dark moldy dungeons, through corridors of hewn stone and timber, and onward to the lofty frozen peaks of Terra, you will uncover the mysteries that surround the exotic islands in the Great Sea.

Alamar's army has besieged the Dragon Pharaoh's pyramid, and rebel monsters are ravaging the countryside and destroying the travel pyramids. Humans and their ilk have been confined to the slums of Castleview. And now fate has elected you and your friends to carry a message of vital importance to one of the few people who can still make a difference. Might and Magic: Swords of Xeen. Nothing is known about Havec, the world on the other side of a newly discovered magical pyramid, except that the evil Lord Xeen, who nearly destroyed two worlds, regularly traveled through the pyramid for unknown purposes. Travel from the small city of Greyhaven in the world of Xeen to Havec in this game that reprises the popular game system of World of Xeen in a new and challenging adventure. Install both Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen on your hard drive to create the World of Xeen.
