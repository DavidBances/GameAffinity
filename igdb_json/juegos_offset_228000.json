The numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of \"4 8 3\" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups.\nTo solve a puzzle, one needs to determine which cells will be boxes and which will be empty. Determining which cells are to be left empty (called spaces) is as important as determining which to fill (called boxes). Later in the solving process, the spaces help determine where a clue (continuing block of boxes and a number in the legend) may spread. Solvers usually use a dot or a cross to mark cells they are certain are spaces.\nIt is also important never to guess. Only cells that can be determined by logic should be filled. If guessing, a single error can spread over the entire field and completely ruin the solution.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7yb8.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":246161,"name":"George Pontos: The Stolen Lyre","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this action dangerous dungeons platformer game you are on a quest to find the lost instrument lyra.

When it was re-released for the Playstation, the graphics were uncensored but toned down script remained. Then came Final Fantasy VI Advance with a newer (though some consider drier) translation, but the color palette and music were altered for the handheld console. Others have made re-translations, such as the great work by RPGOne, Lina Darkstar, and Kwhazit.\n\nNow this is Final Fantasy VI: Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition. The goal was to make the SNES version uncut and to clean up the script but keep the nuance used by Woolsey in the original game’s release. Using the original Woolsey script as a basis to analyze, the entire game was looked through, line by line, using FFVI Advance, RPGOne, and Lina Darkstar to accomplish this. Recently, the game’s script was also heavily analyzed by Kwhazit and Mato (Legends of Localization). With these newer and more heavily detailed looks into the game, the script was again updated to provide a much more accurate version while still remaining true to the original game’s release.\n\nAlso used was various tools and patches to uncensor the graphics, restore Character Class names, extend spell names, rename monsters and items, and make hopefully the version of Final Fantasy VI that everyone will play.\n\nAny bug fixes or additions that were used were chosen not for any balance changes, but to fix persistent issues in the game, as to not change the experience of the original too much. This even includes the long list used in the optional Bug-Fix versions of the game.\n\nAdditional Add-Ons are also optionally included. These tweaks bring an overall complete experience that many would say should have been in the original game to begin with.\n\nThe Music Player included with the game has been altered for compatibility with Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ka7.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Rodimus Primal","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":246584,"name":"Porkérion","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Porkérion is a fangame made in RPG Maker 2003 by HLMTZ.\nIt is a parody of mostly Pokémon, Metal Gear and hispanic internet culture of the 2000s.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ep6.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":246585,"name":"Mother 2 Deluxe","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mother 2 Deluxe is a hack by Messianic that modifies parts of the original EarthBound with the aim of a more refined experience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co79f5.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Messianic","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":246586,"name":"Porkérion 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second entry in the Porkérion series by HLMTZ.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6en3.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":246587,"name":"Yark!: A Kobold Adventure","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Steal the priceless treasures of the local kingdom to pay back your debts to a dragon in this stealth and thievery based, old school fantasy game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co71ti.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"KoboldDev","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":246588,"name":"Return of the Dark Sorcerer","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Return of the Dark Sorcerer is an incredibly large fan-made Final Fantasy 6 modification that’s been in development since around 2010.
