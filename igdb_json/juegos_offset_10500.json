Will you or will you not save the world? Who you interact with, and how, will affect the way the ending is played out. Whatever happens in one city or town can affect another. These choices give additional life to the world of Steel & Steam.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3an8.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Red Meat Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Digerati Distribution","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":10928,"name":"Storm: Frontline Nation","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Arm yourself for the greatest conflict of modern times!

Ever since the old supercomputer has disappeared, the rest of the facility has fallen into utter chaos. The discovery that diesel has thrilling effects on robotic circuits lead to a fierce shift in priorities: Every robot has since been focusing on drinking instead of working. Everyone except Clarc. So when a less-than-peaceful spaceship enters the stage to disarm and dismantle this out-of-control doomsday device of a partying factory, Clarc is the one to save the day. He has to overcome his programming to rescue his fellow robots and, of course, his newfound friend, the lovely atomic bomb, Clara.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/gkxpvkrtpqvhvxfkjhta.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":11048,"name":"Corsairs: The New Conquerors","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The New Conquerors is an expansion disk for Corsairs: Conquest at Sea.\n\nNew features include:\nTwo new campaigns, allowing the player to play as a privateer for two new nations: Spain and Holland\n21 new missions\nA new 'Adventure mode, which is a sandbox mode containing five maps the player can explore freely, without fixed objectives\nThis data disk also allows players to access the new Corsairs Gold content.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/o9f74ikag11qmwciruj1.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Microïds","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":11049,"name":"Crawl","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Crawl is the local multiplayer dungeon crawler where your friends control the monsters!

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.\nThe game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.\nSince its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012.

If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances.

You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends.

It was released by the biblical video game producer Wisdom Tree in 1994, and was the only commercially released SNES game in the U.S. that was not officially sanctioned by Nintendo. In order to bypass the Super Nintendo's lockout chip, Wisdom Tree devised a pass-through system similar to the Game Genie, where the player had to insert an officially licensed SNES game into the cartridge slot on top of the Super 3D Noah's Ark cartridge. Despite its name, it is unrelated to Konami's official Noah's Ark game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In January 2014, the game was re-released for the SNES, initially available only by private email orders, but later through Piko Interactive's website. The game was also updated for the 20th Anniversary Edition and released at itch.io on May 26, 2014 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\nThe game plays similarly to Wolfenstein 3D, but the graphics were changed to reflect a non-violent theme. Instead of killing Nazi soldiers in a castle, the player takes the part of Noah, wandering the Ark, using a slingshot to shoot sleep-inducing food at angry attacking animals, mostly goats, in order to render them unconscious. The animals behave differently: goats, the most common enemy, will only kick Noah, while the other animals such as sheep, ostriches, antelopes and oxen will shoot spittle at him from a distance. Goats are also unable to open doors, which the other animals can do.\nThe gameplay is aimed at younger children. Noah's Ark includes secret passages, food, weapons and extra lives. There are secret levels, and shortcut levels as well. The player eventually comes across larger and more powerful slingshots, and flings coconuts and watermelon at the larger boss-like animals, such as Ernie the Elephant and Carl the Camel.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co258d.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Wisdom Tree","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Piko Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":11169,"name":"Final Fantasy VII Remake","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A spectacular re-imagining of one of the most visionary games ever, Final Fantasy VII Remake rebuilds and expands the legendary RPG for today.

Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal mecha known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.\nHumanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun's policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from Mercury to Titan. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military's elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.\nThe inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien \"Tharsis Cache\"; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.\nThe Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.\nThe game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2v9m.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sierra On-Line","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Dynamix","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":11229,"name":"Earthsiege 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Earthsiege 2 is a mecha-style vehicle simulation game developed by Dynamix, produced by Frank Evers (NYPH), and released in 1996.

Mankind has colonized the solar system and two political entities have emerged: the Alliance consisting of American, Australian, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British and German forces, and The Coalition of Russian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern interests. The game begins with a surprise attack on Fort Kennedy, where a peace treaty turns into a bloodbath: all of the inner four planets are overrun, including Terra herself, and the Italian and French fleets are utterly lost. The Alliance fleet regroups at Triton, Neptune's moon, and attempts to regain lost territory. The player takes the role of a rookie pilot in the international 45th Volunteers squadron, under the command of Captain Robert Foster and Wing Commander Maria Enriquez, aboard the re-commissioned British carrier ANS Reliant.\n\nAs with Wing Commander: Prophecy, the pilot's flying ability is the only meter by which success and failure is measured, though Starlancer does not feature as many branching mission paths. As in Wing Commander I the pilot may be promoted throughout the course of the campaign; unlike WCI, their rank determines which fighters and missiles they may choose to employ during each mission. The game provides a \"virtual carrier\" through which to navigate, including nearby crewmembers whose reaction to you depends on your current rank and standing. However, the true gem of the game lies in its textual and video news broadcasts, which keep the player informed as to the status of the rest of the war, which seems to be progressing just over the horizon. Players frequently find themselves flying alongside squadrons and pilots they have heard about on the news just recently, providing a dose of 'celebrity exposure' and also increasing the sensation that they are just one part of a much larger war effort.\n\nStarlancer's story is continued in Chris Roberts' Freelancer project, though the two belong to different subgenres (the first is purely focused on action, the latter also features trading and the player can freely move through the game's universe when they are not on a mission.)","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jps.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Warthog PLC","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Digital Anvil","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":11231,"name":"Forsaken World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unite against the dark forces that threaten the world of Eyrda in Forsaken World.

Enemies can, however, move in any direction, and auto-aim is utilized to allow the player to fire at nearby enemies or objects both inside and outside of the 2D plane. The player can use the right control stick to aim with a laser sight. Gameplay in Shadow Complex was inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The gameplay takes many cues from Metroid: the player can move freely throughout the expansive game world, defeating enemies with a variety of weapons, and as they overcome challenges, they gain new abilities and weapons which allow them to reach new areas.\nThe game rewards the player with experience points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic attributes of the character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, they will lose all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any benefits they have already received from that experience.\nIn addition to the main campaign, a number of challenge levels, called \"Proving Grounds\", are available, generally requiring the player to make it to the exit of a room using a limited set of items and health. Players are ranked based on time of completion and any scoring objectives when they complete the level. Scores and other statistics from the main campaign and the training group are tracked via online leaderboards.\nA remastered version and port was announced during the 215 Game Awards, to be released for PS4, Xbox One, PC.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2421.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Epic Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ChAIR Entertainment Group","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":11330,"name":"Heroes Never Lose: Professor Puzzler's Perplexing Ploy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Heroes Never Lose: Professor Puzzler's Perplexing Ploy is a hero themed action-puzzle game with a super-powered twist!

Part of Blizzard's StarCraft series, the game was announced on September 20, 2002, and was to be developed by Nihilistic Software for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. Several delays in development caused Blizzard to move back the release date and the game has not yet materialized. Nihilistic Software ceded development to Swingin' Ape Studios in 2004 before Blizzard bought the company, and plans for the GameCube version were cancelled in 2005.\n\nBlizzard announced in March 2006 that the game was put on \"indefinite hold\" while the company investigated seventh generation video game console possibilities. Subsequent public statements from company personnel had been contradictory about whether production was to be renewed or planned story elements worked into other products. The continued delay of Ghost had caused it to be labeled as vaporware, and it was ranked fifth in Wired News‍'​ annual Vaporware Awards in 2005. In 2014, Blizzard president Mike Morhaime confirmed that Ghost was officially cancelled.\n\nUnlike its real-time strategy predecessor StarCraft, Ghost is a third-person shooter, and was intended to give players a closer and more personal view of the StarCraft universe. Following Nova, a Terran psychic espionage operative called a \"ghost\", the game is set four years after the conclusion of StarCraft: Brood War and covers a conspiracy about a secretive military project conducted by Nova's superiors in the imperial Terran Dominion. Very little of the game's storyline has been released; however, in November 2006 after the game's postponement, a novel was published called StarCraft Ghost: Nova, which covers the backstory of the central character.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2wby.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Swingin' Ape Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nihilistic Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Blizzard Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"}]},{"id":11356,"name":"Airscape: The Fall of Gravity","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Airscape is a fast-paced, ultra-challenging 60 level action platformer.
