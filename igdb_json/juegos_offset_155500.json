For the remastering, both games have had a graphical overhaul to allow them to support modern high-definition displays up to 1080p. With the more powerful PlayStation 3, both games feature a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second; the original PlayStation 2 version of Shadow of the Colossus was noted for pushing the limits of the older console and often suffered from framerate losses. Both games support stereoscopic 3D, taking advantage of the original design of the games with considerations towards depth-of-field viewing, as evidenced by the large landscapes. Both games in the collection support 7.1 surround sound.\n\nIco's remastering is based on the European version, which features additional content that did not make it into the North America release of the original game, as well as some altered puzzles from these original releases. Specifically, upon completing the game, the player can restart to see the English translations of the mysterious language that Yorda, the player character's companion, uses, and a two-player mode with the second player in control of Yorda. Though there was consideration for inclusion of PlayStation Move motion control support, it was not released with it.\n\nThe collection includes bonus content, including two XMB Dynamic Themes and exclusive video content for Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and Ueda's next game, The Last Guardian.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4akn.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Team Ico","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SCE Japan Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bluepoint Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":112054,"name":"Dragon, Fly!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As a newly hatched dragon pup you still have too tiny wings to fly.

Sam has several weapons, such as a rocket launcher or tossing Serious Bombs, which he will use to destroy the Kamikaze. If they hit the Kamikaze, he will die. The Kamikaze can jump over projectiles, or kick them away if they're getting too close. However, the Kamikaze has a rage meter which will increase whenever he kicks. If the meter gets too high, he will explode, which will take away one of the Kamikaze's lives. If the Kamikaze runs out of lives, the player will lose and have to restart from the beginning. There is also a point system, which rewards the player for things like kicking back projectiles and killing Sam.\n\nThe levels take place in locations such as a desert and a forest. There are also challenge levels that test the player's skills, which are good for those that have completed the basic game and want more out of it.\n\nThe player can buy and wear heads for the Beheaded Kamikaze, which will change various attributes of him, such as changing the rage meter penalty for when the Kamikaze kicks a projectile away.

On the main overworld, BRS can explore the available areas and look for certain items. Battles begin when the player comes into contact with an enemy on the overworld. During a battle, BRS can aim and shoot with her rock cannon at enemies, block against attacks, and sidestep to avoid them completely. If the player fires the rock cannon or uses the sidestep too much in a short time, the system will overheat, leaving the player vulnerable to attack until it cools down. Throughout the game, players can earn abilities that can be equipped to BRS and used in battle, each with their own cooldown periods. These include offensive attacks such as a powerful blast, a sniper rifle, or support abilities that can increase BRS' stats such as her attack or defense. Certain sections will also see BRS ride a motorcycle, in which she can attack enemies on either side of her or use weapons to fire in front of enemies.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f5w.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Imageepoch","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NIS America","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":212757,"name":"Bizzare","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bizzare is a Yume Nikki fangame.

Based upon the gameplay of the Age of Empires series, it was originally developed by Robot Entertainment, but on February 24, 2011, Gas Powered Games, took over production. The game was published by Microsoft.\n\nThe game was free-to-play—it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, the game premiered on Steam after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the Celtic civilization. On June 15, 2012 the premium content system was changed to offer the option to purchase all past and future content through \"Empire points\" earned in game, or by purchasing the points directly with real world money.\n\nAs of January 3, 2013, Microsoft ceased further development on the game. A Microsoft representative later announced on the forums that on August 22, 2013, the Games for Windows – Live Marketplace would be shut down, leaving the game only accessible by current or former players. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014 when the service would be shut down. The closure was due to the content being too expensive to maintain.\n\nIn 2017, Age of Empires Online was reestablished using Microsoft's publicly released developer-kit for the game and is now hosted on a server emulator known as \"Project Celeste\". The game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft's unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed.
