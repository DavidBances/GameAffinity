There is also another game mode called Flood, which involves fending off waves of demons and sealing the gates through which they come. This is primarily a multiplayer mode, but it can also be played with friendly bots.\n\nThe game's setting has strong medieval fantasy motives. The eight weapons at the player's disposal either come from a medieval arsenal (dagger, crossbow, sword) or are various holy spells like Smite and Trinity Blast which are powered by manna. Essentially, most weapons function similarly to those of Quake. However, each also has an alternate firing mode that can be toggled at any time. Alternate attacks deal more damage at the cost of increased ammo consumption.\n\nThe monsters also have medieval fantasy designs, sometimes reminiscent of Heretic or Hexen. These include zombies, levitating necromancers and various humanoid fighters in medieval attire. Many of the enemies have special abilities and alternate attacks, making them even more dangerous.\n\nOne special feature unique to Eternal War is the player's ability to pray, which allows Mike to regain full health. It is not possible to fight while praying, but the player is surrounded by an aura that will banish any demons that might try to attack him.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3jeg.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Two Guys Software, Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":142541,"name":"When I Get Home","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Just what it says.

To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given a new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm. No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun?\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 02\nA VIP arriving from abroad mysteriously disappears in transit. The SORD team at Mihama Academy is presented with a new mission: finding and recovering him. Whenever they appear to be closing in on this missing \"package\", though, it somehow slips through their fingers. Accompanying them on their mission are two fellow SORD from the Kyousen Sakuragaoka campus - twin sisters, who both help and hinder the crew. There have also been rumors floating around of a daredevil biker named \"Soul Speed\", who tears up the streets at night. Before long, the team's thrilling chase descends into a deathmatch, pushing the combatants to their limits and beyond. Rena and Haruto, meanwhile, are taken on a journey deep into the past, to their first-ever encounter.\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 03\nWhile Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip. Within moments of their arrival, though, the Mihama gang are pulled into a manhunt for a SORD deserter, assisted by students Sylvia and Velvet of St. Aile's International School. Tohka's the star of the show this time round, but she's wrestling with her own issues - old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep...\n“You're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.”\n“Let's meet up again someday... if we're still alive.”\nAnd introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's:\n“If taking her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I simply want to see this mess cleaned up.”\nWhat answers will Tohka find?\nShe has the truth in her sights...\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 04\nKumashiro Megumi (Gumi), recently transferred from St. Aile's International School, has been training hard together with Rena and Maki – now fully recovered from their injuries. With the help of her mentor, Tohka, she's shaping up to be a fine sniper.\nJust as one new student settles in, another has her sights set on joining the girls in Class A, Mihama's elite combat unit. Her name? Sengoku Taiga. Haruto, the team's handler, has one condition for Taiga's transfer: that Chris serves as her supervising officer.\nThe two seem an unlikely pair at first, but after spending some time with little Taiga, Chris soon finds a way to see things from her perspective.\nIt's at that moment that the nation is suddenly rocked by a terror attack on an unprecedented scale. Chris rushes to the scene, aware of what's at stake, but paying no heed to the dangers ahead.\nJust as she did, once before.\n\"This is even worse than we could've imagined...\"\nThe death toll keeps on rising, but SORD are stuck watching helplessly from the sidelines. What destiny awaits Chris, Taiga... and Mihama Academy?\n\"Oh, right... I must have died...\"\nClutching to memories of her long-dead mother, she too prepares for an eternity of slumber...\n\nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 05\nA few weeks have passed since SORD successfully resolved the Kitaoka University terrorist incident - albeit with some sacrifices - when Murasaki's older sister Yuuki returns to Japan and returns to Mihama Academy.\nBeing more sociable and capable than her sister, Yuuki immediately befriends the other students and builds a trusting relationship with them.\n\"There's no reason for me to be at Mihama anymore...\"\nAs Murasaki starts questioning her raison d'etre, she reminisces about the time when she first met Haruto.\nA few years earlier...\nLamenting his lack of experience, he had come to her village hidden deep in the mountains in search of new skills.\nHe got to know the Ikoma sisters better and kept up with his training. As he seeks out the village's \"secret art\", a sudden tragedy befalls them.\n\"I'll never forgive you...!!\"\n\"It's okay... Don't worry... I'm not... going anywhere... I'm here with you...\"\n\"I'm stumped... It's exactly as she said - and there's no way to cut a phantom...\"\n\"Come on. Chin up...
