If you use your right mouse button you can launch an avalanche rocket. And for every enemy you send scurrying back, you get bonus points.

More alarmingly, he has constructed the Shadowforge - a potent magical artifact that has enhanced both his power and ambition for conquest; Jaterus is first on his list. Your job is to quash his aspirations by finding and destroying the device.\n\nThe town of Jaterus is your base of operations, its main attractions being the weapon and armor shops, the inn (where you can recuperate after a sojourn to the dungeon), the temple (where health potions are sold), and the tavern (which, besides refreshments, offers conversation - some of it helpful). The various random NPCs do not communicate, though.\n\nThe dungeon is populated by Greymere's minions; some are randomly placed, others are not, and all must be bested in turn-based combat - the deeper you go, the tougher the bad guys. Fighting involves both melee and ranged attacks, and defeated monsters will bequeath both gold and experience. Leveling up will increase your maximum hit points, but no other stats are tracked.

This grizzled anti-Valkyria squad is equipped with advanced mana weaponry and has the powerful ability to wield ragnite spells to combat this terrifying threat. The unit is comprised of soldiers who have a high affinity for ragnite, and even Jutland's own Princess Ophelia has joined the ranks. The princess carries the utmost love for her country and has answered the call of duty to liberate those who are suffering from the Ruzi's tyranny. However, Amleth , the commanding officer of Vanargand, hides a terrible secret. Is he friend or foe to the country he has sworn to protect?\n\n- Story About War and Liberation - Taking place in an alternate world based on the European era of industrialization, players will band together with Jutland's elite soldiers, the Vanargand, as they fight against the merciless Ruzi Empire. However, things may not be as black and white as they seem.\n\n- A Revolution in RPG Combat - Though it bears the Valkyria name, Valkyria Revolution eschews the original series' traditional turn-based strategy for a new hybrid of fast paced real-time combat and tactical acumen across battlefields. Balancing deadly attacks and cunning strategy will be the key to victory.\n\n- A New Painterly Look with a Vibrant Soundtrack - The world of Valkyria Revolution is brought to life by the unique visual style provided by a new graphical engine and a vibrant soundtrack composed by the celebrated Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger, Stella Glow).\n\n- Languages - The powerful drama can be experienced in its original Japanese voice acting with English subtitles or in a brand-new English dub!\n\n- Limited Edition includes a 12 song Soundtrack
