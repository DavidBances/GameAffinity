The damage caused by the long wars led both world powers to evacuate the population to recently built underground cities.\n\nAustralia and most parts of Africa were sacrificed during the long wars, which lasted several decades. Highly toxic biological and chemical weapons were developed on these continents, leaving them so badly contaminated, that no human life can survive there. Not even the use of robots and machines is possible. The general opinion was that these continents would forever remain uninhabitable, and they were wiped from every map. Most of the world's population forgot that this land ever existed.\n\nNatural resources are becoming scarce and have to be extracted above ground. There have been a number of small conflicts between the UCS and the ED, the last of which escalated and became a fierce and bitter war - the final world war. Only one side can win.

The objective is typically to locate the exit within each level, which can involve scrolling from left to right, top to bottom, or navigating labyrinth-like designs. Enemies are defeated using various punches, and each character differs in their attack range and damage output. Additionally, each character possesses a unique special attack and individual abilities. For instance, Colossus can smash specific materials, and Wolverine gradually regenerates health over time.\n\nInitially starting as Wolverine, players later gain the ability to switch between characters at any point in the game.

Unlike the console and the DS versions, a top-down perspective is used.\n\nThe game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown. The player starts as a Toa of Fire, but by completing zones and killing the level boss, additional masks can be collected: Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water. Each Toa has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's elemental nature, with specific features. During the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter which needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific Toa guise, but in the Free Play mode completed levels can be revisited and players can then switch between the forms at any time to use different abilities. Toa can strafe while fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this manually.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5xe6.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Amaze Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"TT Games Publishing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Eidos Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":200960,"name":"Friday Night Funkin': Smoke 'Em Out Struggle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Smoke 'Em Out Struggle is an original full week mod.
