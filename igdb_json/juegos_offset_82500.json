Set in the year 2083 in Neo Hong-Kong the story follows Mei-Lin Mak, a young woman with cybernetic eyes pulled into the maelstrom of an unsolved supernatural mystery from centuries past. As she peers deeper into the mystery, her perception of reality slowly crumbles around her, leaving her to question every intricacy of her surroundings.\n\nUnder the neon lights of a cyperpunk dystopia, the ruins of the Chung Sing building hide a bloody mystery illuminated by both the traditions of Chinese folklore and the innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei-Lin must explore this complex, piecing together the stories of 14 lost souls, and discover the truth of her own family curse. With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, Sense hopes to return the horror genre to its roots; celebrating the slow, fearful creep of dread instead of turning to action and jump scares. Mei is not a trained agent; she is a programmer and not a soldier; the ghosts – the glitches of reality – are spirits and not spectral zombies; and the scares are from within, not from the horrors around.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1xgy.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EastAsiaSoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Suzaku","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Top Hat Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":94121,"name":"Maverick","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Join a soldier in an single-player campaign against swat and agents.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3nql.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":75083,"name":"Glitch's Trip","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Travel through four epic worlds by jumping, shooting, and glitching in this intense twin-stick action platfomrer.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1jrt.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ransacked Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Rogue Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":322543,"name":"Final Memories","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co922g.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Aztec Game Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":299387,"name":"Chiclana & Friends: The Game","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Try to survive as many waves as possible with the best score in this game in which you control three characters at the same time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co84x0.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":257902,"name":"Elshe no Shounen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A short story about a boy who has been held captive by his \"older sister\" Elshe ever since he remembers.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6tip.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mizushiki","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":238270,"name":"Jigsaw Masterpieces: Chihuahua -
