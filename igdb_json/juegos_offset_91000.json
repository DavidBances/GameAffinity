As soon as all gold is collected the level ends right away.\n\nEach level represents a room in a mansion, with several platforms, ladders and hazards such as fire. There are enemies moving over the platforms and they are able to use ladders. There are free-roaming flying creatures as well. A single encounter with an enemy or a hazard is immediately deadly and makes the level restart. There are no ways to attack the enemies, they can only be avoided.\n\nA lot of the gameplay revolves around luring the enemies away in a certain direction so you can pass and grab the gold on the other side. There are platforms where it is possible to drop down through them right away. Certain pieces of gold can only be reached through digging. Pickaxes can be picked up in certain levels and they allow the character to dig down once per axe. Other game elements are bridges that can be activated and timed explosions that can be triggered to clear a part of then environment.

Bodenplatte was the German code word for the bold operation to launch a surprise low-level attack on multiple Allied airfields on Jan 1st, 1945. It contains eight aircraft (additional Collector Planes are available as separate DLCs).\n\nBattle of Bodenplatte puts you at the scene of some of the most important battles on the Western Front as the Allies are knocking on Germany’s door and trying to cross the Rhine River into Germany for the first time. Fly in support of Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and Operation Bodenplatte. Try to once and for all destroy the Luftwaffe or try to blunt the Allied advance into Germany. It’s was the peak piston-engine power and the dawn of the jet age, a time when famous Allied aces roamed the sky and desperate German defenders were trying to just survive, now outnumbered and no longer the masters of the air. Fight in aerial engagements over lush, green farmland and dense wooded forests or find yourself twisting and turning over frozen fields and icy rivers of the bitterly cold winter of 1944-45. Do you have the skills to survive the harrowing air combat?\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Bodenplatte adds a new Western front theater to the IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series of products. Steam requires you own Battle of Stalingrad before you can add Battle of Bodenplatte. Combined with Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Moscow and Battle of Kuban, the series covers the combat pilot experience spanning both Eastern and Western fronts in WWII. Dogfight over the frozen steppes of Russia, the scenic mountains and beaches the Caucasus region or the doorstep of Germany itself. There is not a more monumental combat flight-simulator experience on the market with such a wide range of planes and theaters crafted to this level of detail. The physics, realism, systems, beauty, atmosphere, features, gameplay, performance, history and options combine to set a new standard of playability and fun in this important genre. IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series is not a simply a PC game, it’s an AIR COMBAT SIMULATOR.

It is the third game in the Nostalgia series and a spiritual successor to Konami's Keyboardmania series.\n\nThe game consists of falling bars corresponding to certain areas of the keyboard. When the bars cross the judgement line it is time to play that key. There are three type of notes - Normal note which you play as normal, slide note where you slide your hand across the keyboard and trill note where you rapidly and alternately press two neighbouring keys.\n\nOp.3 adds more sorting functionality to the song selection screens, which is needed as the song list has grown in size. It also allows you to filter on your scores and grades, making it easier to improve your overall skill level in the game. Recital mode is now a toggle on the standard mode instead of another mode.\n\nThis is the first time in the series where some songs are not carried over from previous version, due to licenses not being renewed. 75 songs were brought forward from Nostalgia, 97 from Nostalgia: Forte and 126 from Nostalgia: Op.2. Along with the 49 new songs in Op.3, that brings the total song list up to 347 songs (as of 27th June 2020). Since this is an currently active game, the song list will likely expand up until the release of the next game in the series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2b93.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami Amusement","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":132838,"name":"Sunshine Secret Book 64","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sunshine Secret Book 64 is a ROM hack released on December 2, 2019 by Dan-GPTV.
