With more chapters released each season, unravel the epic story arc underpinning the Kingdom Draw universe.\n\nOnline Ladder Play\n\nPit yourself against other players from around the world with cross-platform ladder play. Do you have what it takes to ascend the ladder with every victory and reap your rewards? At the end of each season, earn bonus rewards for how high you progressed up the ladder. Make it to the Titan league to have your alias displayed (and glorified for all time) in the Hall of Fame.\n\nDeck Building\n\nBuy randomised card packs with gems earned through ladder play and campaigns; or redeem victory tokens to obtain specific cards of your choice. Build your own custom, synergising decks to dominate your opponents and become a Titan of Kingdom Draw. With 185 distinct cards to collect, and more cards being released each season, you can always craft new variations to trial out in battle.\n\nTurn-based Strategy\n\nHone your turn-based strategy skills. Matches in Kingdom Draw take place on a hexagonal grid where you play army, support, and beast cards on the map. Strategically control locations to earn more resources, take advantage of terrain, and be the first to destroy your opponent’s castle. Use power cards to decimate your enemies, alter your cards’ combat effectiveness, and modify the terrain.\n\nFriendly Matches\n\nLooking for something more casual? Stick with the devil you know and add friends to challenge them to friendly battles. Friendly battles do not alter your ladder ranking or provide rewards, so you can trial your deck creations in a more relaxed arena.\n\nCross Platform\n\nLink your account across multiple platforms, allowing you to continue playing wherever you are.
