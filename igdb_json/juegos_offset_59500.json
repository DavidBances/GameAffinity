This is an all-new game which picks up where Edelweiss ended.\n\nThe heroines of this new story are Takase Sakura and Fujisaki Rin, two background characters who dominated the popularity polls and conquered the original heroines. This fan-disk will present an all-new story full of laughs and naughty things.\n\nOne scenario begins when Sakura, the girl many people suspect is a lesbian, is hanging with the guys and evaluating other chicks with them. When Kazushi says there’s no way he would ever fall for Sakura, Sakura puts her pride as a girl on the line and their competition begins. If he falls for her, he loses! As their classmates start a betting pool to see who’ll win and interfering to better their chances, who knows what ending awaits, let alone how Eiden Island’s power will affect the outcome!\n\nThe other scenario begins when Rin and Kazushi are both elected as their class representatives. As the two grow closer together, Kazushi winds up in an accident trying to save her. As a result, he suddenly finds himself with something that speaks residing in his crotch.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mzk.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MangaGamer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"OVERDRIVE","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"OOParts"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":64259,"name":"Nyan Cat: Jump!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Nyan Cat's rainbow has been stolen by Tac Nayn.

It is an original story, although the amusement park theme is constantly revisited in the franchise, especially in anime and game form. The protagonist is Conan Edogawa, the alter ego of Shinichi Kudō, a high school detective who was transformed unwillingly into a kid. Chika Yūenchi Satsujin Jiken itself is an adventure game where the task is to solve murder cases. The player controls Conan from a top-down perspective and can move around freely in the park, seeking for clues or engaging other characters in conversation. Sometimes it's possible to choose what to ask a character, but that has no outcome on how the case proceeds. The investigation is moved forward by talking to the right people, finding the necessary clues, solving puzzles and by \"thinking\". The latter is an actual gameplay mechanic where Conan analyses certain events that he finds suspicious. It ends with the player selecting one out of two deductions. If the incorrect answer was chosen, the accusation will not hold and the murderer will get away. Furthermore, it's possible to officially accuse a suspect with insufficient proof and without finishing the entire scenario, even if this results in arresting the wrong person or ending the game prematurely.\n\nThe game has three different murder cases, each corresponding to one of the attractions in the amusement park: the roller coaster, the horror house and the huge maze. The first attraction Conan enters after being greeted by Nobuhara and the staff decides which scenario the player will play. In order to switch to another murder case, the game must be started over. The only way to resume a previous session is via passwords the game gives at specific points during the scenario.\n\nA standard feature adopted by later installments is the presence of mini games. Two of them (a claw crane and a skateboarding game) can be played at any time in the Game Center, while others must be found or unlocked.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co52m9.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":64543,"name":"Fly With Me","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fly With Me is a downloadable title for iOS devices from EA.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pblmce1rxysy7jblyffv.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":64544,"name":"Samurai & Dragons","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":64545,"name":"Wrestling Universe: Fire Pro Joshi Dome Choujo Taisen - Zenjo vs JWP","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This all-female wrestling game is an Arcade CD release for the PC Engine.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vdf8tnmxivbcedkp2tix.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":64546,"name":"W.E.L.D.E.R.","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A word game for iOS where you move tiles around to create words.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bqbnhcyrcfqnkdp4vkwc.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":64547,"name":"Detective Conan: Saikou no Aibou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Meitantei Conan: Saikou no Aibou is a PlayStation game released in 2002.
