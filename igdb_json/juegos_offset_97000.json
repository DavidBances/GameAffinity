These cookies look so good you‚Äôll want to take a bite out of your phone!\n\nMore Cookies! lets you bake virtual cookies just like you make real ones in the kitchen. Pick a recipe from the built-in cookbook, then drag the ingredients into the mixing bowl and mix up the dough with your finger.\n\nAfter your dough is made, you can roll it out (for rolled cookies like sugar cookies & gingerbread) and use dozens of cookie cutters to cut out a pan full of cookies, or drop bits of cookie dough on the pan (for drop cookies like chocolate chip or oatmeal).\n\nPut your cookies in the oven, set the timer, and in seconds they‚Äôll bake! Then you can choose from a wide variety of frostings, icings, colored sugars, sprinkles, candies, and nuts to decorate them just how you want.\n\nWhen you‚Äôve made the perfect cookies, email them to your friends, save them in your photos library, or virtually eat them bite by bite.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6rcy.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Maverick Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":105535,"name":"Poppix","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripci√≥n","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]}]
