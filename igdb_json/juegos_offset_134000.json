The games' model number are PG-74 for the Tabletop game and PG-92 for the Panorama game. PG in the model number stands for Popeye Game. The Panorama game took and came with two LR44 batteries, while the Tabletop version came with two C batteries. Nintendo manufactured 250,000 versions of both games in America and Europe. It's unknown how many were manufactured in Japan. The game is based on the lucrative Popeye franchise, and in it you control Popeye. Nintendo was known during that era to create games based off on the Popeye franchise.\n\nBrutus has kidnapped Olive, and as Popeye you have to knock him out and punch him into the ocean to save Olive. The directional pad controls Popeye left and right. When Brutus tries to punch your character, move Popeye right to make him avoid the punch, then counter with one of your own. If Brutus move Popeye to the very right hand part of the pier, Popeye can still stay on by moving the control pad right at just the right moments, then counter-attack to move Brutus back to the left. Once Popeye moves Brutus to the very left hand corner of the pier, he will have to attack him a certain amount of times (the exact amount depending on your score) before he punches him into the ocean. In Game B a swordfish will occasionally try and poke Popeye. If it succeeds, then Popeye will move back a bit.\n\nAfter Brutus gets out of the ocean for the third time, Olive, who's at the top tied up, will kick cans of spinach down to Popeye for him to eat. If done so successfully, Popeye will gain so much strength that he knocks Brutus all the way up to the hook at the upper left hand corner. Following that, Popeye goes up to where Olive Ollie is and saves her, thus ending the game. After the game ends, it starts over again. If Popeye misses the Spinach, then he'll have to knock Brutus back into the ocean before she'll be able to kick more spinach down towards him.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3auy.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game & Watch"}]},{"id":145161,"name":"Theseus","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Theseus never killed the Minotaur.

Commissioned and funded by SEGA, development was started by French developer No Cliché, which was acquired by SEGA in 1997.Creative direction was done by Frédérick Raynal, a pioneering figure in the establishment of the survival horror genre with the influential Alone In the Dark series. Development started in 2000 (possibly earlier, in 1999), although references to the game can be found as early as 1998. The name of the game itself is a city, which, according to esotericist literature, resides in the core of planet earth.\n\nIntending to release in 2001, this coincided with SEGA's decision to discontinue the production of the Dreamcast. On January 30 2001, SEGA announced that no more Dreamcast consoles would be manufactured. Games that were already in development at that time were supposed to be brought to completion however. In spite of that announcement, Agartha never reached that state of development. No Cliché stopped development on as per order of SEGA Europe and ceased to exist soon after. Sometime between May 26 and July 22 of 2001.\n\nIn 2008, the website unseen64, dedicated to documenting the history of unreleased video games, created an article about Agartha, documenting the little information that is known about the game. In the comments, one or more developers shared some memories and insights developing the game.\n\nThe website also acquired a clip of 15 minutes very early in-game footage, displaying the eerie mood and the technical and graphical prowess of No Cliché.\n\nIn 2018, an E3 Build was made available online.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xav.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"No Cliché","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":145520,"name":"Shachibato!

While combat works similar as in Astonishia Story, there are a lot of surprising WRPG influences. In the beginning the main character's class is determined by a catalog of questions, just like in many Ultima games. Then three companions are picked from a variety of classes and typical fantasy races (Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits). Two more slots are available for more characters to join temporarily, or even replace some of the original companions for good.\n\nThe game is much more nonlineal and open ended than most Far Eastern RPGs, every town holds a variety of sidequests, which often rely on character's classes or the party's reputation, which is raised by doing good deeds. On the other hand the game punishes what the writer deemed immoral behavious, taking inspiration once again from Ultima. For a good portion of the game there isn't even a real \"main story\" to follow, that only unfolds after solving many individual tasks. Player decisions often have a deep impact on the outcome of a quest. At one point, for example, the party gets caught by a dragon, but manages to escape, alongside many other prisoners. If the heroes then chose to chase and kill the dragon for its treasure instead of fleeing directly, the dragon escapes, killing all fleeing prisoners on the way. The game is also full of little touches, most notable the party doesn't follow the leader in a straight line like in most JRPGs, but in a losely tied bunch of individuals.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xhk.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Phantagram","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sonnori","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":145574,"name":"Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties Mobile","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Published by Glu Mobile and based on the Microsoft PC licence expansion, it's a themed version of the main Age of Empire 3 game.\n\nOf course, you get to choose between the short Skirmish or long Campaign modes, with the action taking place across China, Japan, and India.\n\nEach civilisation has its own unique units, buildings and wonders, which you choose between to optimise your gameplay style.\n\nTo test our your strategic skills, within Skirmish you can also play challenges such as Regicide, which places a king unit on the map, whom you have to find and kill.\n\nSimilarly, King of the Hill takes place on a map with a central fortress, where players are in constant struggle to take control of the stronghold and defend it until the timer runs out.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xho.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ensemble Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Glu Mobile","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"BlackBerry OS"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":145575,"name":"Xenoage: Knight of the Rihas","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Civil wars continue throughout Fantasido continent.

In more recent times, this claim had to be corrected to \"first Korean colored RPG for MS-DOS PCs\", which sounds much less impressive. However, it can also be labeled as the first to follow the JRPG route a la Dragon Quest, because previous games all either stemmed from Western influences or were action RPGs. \n \nAs one of the many games based on the story of Hong Gildong and thanks to its screentexts kept completely in Han'geul (it even sacrificed the full VGA color palette for a higher resolution to make it more readable, though everything other than the text was just upscaled) in a time when even the wave of Taiwan-localizations had just started to catch some current, it caught a bit of attention. A+ sold 7,000 copies of the game3, which wasn't that bad for a Korean game in 1993, but even then most reviews weren't that favorable because of a number of flaws. \n \nFirst and foremost stands the obfuscated design, that often leaves players not knowing what they are even expected to do. Then there's the overly simple and boring combat system, especially due to the lack of a party, which really limits the tactical depth. The rest is done by a fair share of bugs and glitches, as well as some more incomprehensible decisions like having an option to throw away items permanently while pretty much everything picked up except weapons and armor is quest-related.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xkd.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":145613,"name":"Little Witch","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ablex' first game follows the titular Little Witch on her quest to become a full-blown witch. In a platformer/adventure hybrid she has to explore woods and caves, learn new spells and solve the problems of numerous people and magical creatures on her way. The game's mechanics and progression are similar to some of the Wonder Boy episodes, with slightly more emphasis on \"RPG elements\". It is also text heavy for this kind of game, and pages over pages on a special story book screen are no rarity.\n\nThe game world is divided into seperate areas, but some of the dungeons are huge and map-drawing is almost obligatory. Most of the witch's spells are used to fight the many imaginative enemies, but \"talk\" is a spell too, which results in frequent inconvenient switching in the menu. Without some serious grinding, most enemies are capable to kill the witch fast, resulting in many frustrating game over screens, but at least it is possible to save the game at any time. Yet the function should be handled with care, because it is also possible to save in unwinnable situations.\n\nLittle Witch has enough inspiration and fun ideas to be a very entertaining little game (it even uses pictures as doors to jump through between areas, two years before Super Mario 64), however done by a bunch of university students, the technical execution leaves much to be desired. There's hardly ever been choppier scrolling in a retail game and everything flickers like crazy, making enemies much harder than they need to be and not seldom rendering the game almost unplayable. The potential for a great game was there, and the graphics look really nice (if amateurish), but it would have needed a bit more programming expertise to truly shine.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xke.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":145614,"name":"Her Knights: Kyrie Eleison","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xkf.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":145615,"name":"Iljimae-jeon: Manman Papa Sikjeok-pyeon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xkg.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":145616,"name":"Battle Blues","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The turn-based Strategy/RPG developed by a team called Shin's Deko was another of the Korean 3DO exclusives LG pushed forward, and because of that also one of the rarest games of its time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ipu.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"LG Electronics","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"3DO Interactive Multiplayer"}]},{"id":145617,"name":"Tahl: Uncover the Evil Within","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"Tahl\": Uncover the Evil Within is an isometric action RPG dungeon crawler where the player fights against hordes of ghosts and demons from East Asian mythology using point-and-click controls.
