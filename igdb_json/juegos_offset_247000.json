In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' home, she receives a phone call from her mother. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, you must navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother.\n\nThree Fourths Home takes a look into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, and familial obligation.\n\nAs a visual short story, dialogue choice is the primary focus of Three Fourths Home.\nBetween the main game and the epilogue, nearly 800 unique dialogue choices shade the story differently based on how you play. In addition to dialogue choice, you must also keep driving in order to keep the conversation going. Stop, and time slows to a crawl. Kelly has to move forward in order to get home.\n\nThree Fourths Home: Extended Edition includes an expanded edit of the initial release as well as several new elements, including a new epilogue in addition to a number of extra features.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":213580,"name":"Sunday Lawd Reel 1","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cranking SLOW at times is the key to playing this game...as it plays out as an old film, you can change the reels by slowing down cranks until a different outcome happens!
