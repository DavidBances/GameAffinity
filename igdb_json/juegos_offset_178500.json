The U.S. government decided that a large-scale attack would prove risky, and so a small group of Special Forces was formed...\n\n\"Only one machine is fit for such a task...\"\n\nIn this simulator the player controls an AH-64 Apache, the \"primary attack helicopter in the U.S. Arsenal\". It can be controlled from 5 different points of view, including 1st (inside the cockpit) and 3rd person ones. The on screen display holds valuable information to the pilot, such as damage meters, status of engines, rotor brakes, wheel brakes and hover, air speed, altitude, compass, radar, RPM, Torque, Fuel and more.\n\nThe game features two control systems: arcade and physics mode. In arcade mode the helicopter maintains altitude while flying forward, while the physics mode is based on real world physics, thus, when the helicopter is moving forward, it will also lose altitude if the motor power isn't increased. The helicopter can be controlled either with a keyboard/mouse combo or with a joystick.\n\nThe AH-64 comes equipped with 3 different types of weapons: Hellfire Missiles, m230 Chain Gun 30mm Automatic Cannon and Hydra Rockets. There is also a fourth kind of weapon, the Zuni Rockets, only available later in the game. Hellfire missiles are target lockable and the Cannon can be aimed with the mouse.\n\nThere are 30 unique missions in this game; in most of them the player must accomplish several objectives, usually destroying enemy buildings and vehicles. The game can be saved at the end of each mission, but not during them. If the player gets killed during a mission, he must start it all over again, but the number of tries is unlimited.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ts4.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":53999,"name":"Empire Earth: Gold Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This Gold Edition contains: \n \n- Empire Earth (base game) \n- Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest (add-on) \n- Official strategy guide","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2fl2.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mad Doc Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sierra Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Stainless Steel Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":49801,"name":"Sylvania Family: Yosei no Stick to Fushigi no Ki - Maron Inu no Onna no Ko","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sylvania Family: Yosei no Stick to Fushigi no Ki - Maron Inu no Onna no Ko is a Role-Playing game, published by Epoch, which was released in Japan in 2003.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49445,"name":"Ashita no Joe: Masseki ni Moe Agare!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ashita no Joe: Masseki ni Moe Agare! is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2003.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co964a.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":47568,"name":"MLB Slam!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"MLB Slam! is an MLB-licensed baseball game that offers six game modes. It uses the MLB statistics of the 2003 season based on the league standings as of 26th August of that year and all 30 teams. In Quick Match a quick game can be played with randomly assigned teams. Spring Training is similar, but there the teams can be chosen. Full Season is the main game mode with a season 162 games. It follows the 2003 schedule and includes all inter-league games and the World Series. A season is started with an opening day MLB roster or a dream team. A dream team can be used in all games modes except for exhibition games. A dream team is built starting with a $45,000 budget for a 15-person roster including at least three pitchers and one player for each position. Players can still be bought or sold afterwards and money is earned based on the performance. During a season statistics change based on the performance. Games can be simulated to move quicker and tactics include setting the batting order and field lineup.\n\nThe three remaining game modes are World Series, Homerun Derby and 2 Player Game. World Series takes a team immediately to the World Series for the conclusion without having to play an entire season. Homerun Derby is a game of three rounds where two team take turns hitting the ball out of the park. After ten outs the teams switch positions. 2 Player Game is a local competitive multiplayer game using Bluetooth. There are three difficulty levels.\n\nAs in most baseball titles a game is split up into different phases, each with their own controls for hitting, running, pitching and fielding. However, outfield and base running are left almost entirely under the control of the computer. Hitting a ball is done by moving a target into a strike zone where the pitch will cross the plate while simultaneously timing the swing button.

As in role-playing games, players level up their heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission.\n\nThe scenario was developed with the \"World Editor\" of Reign of Chaos, and was updated upon the release of its expansion, The Frozen Throne. There have been many variations of the original concept; the most popular being DotA Allstars, which eventually was simplified to DotA with the release of version 6.68. This specific scenario has been maintained by several authors during development, the latest of whom is the anonymous developer known as \"IceFrog\" who has developed the game since 2005.\n\nSince its original release, DotA has become a feature at several worldwide tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon and the Asian World Cyber Games, as well as the Cyberathlete Amateur and CyberEvolution leagues; in a 2008 article of video game industry website Gamasutra, the article's author claimed that DotA was probably \"the most popular and most-discussed free, non-supported game mod in the world\".
