The race took place between August 27 and 31 2018 in Argentina. As with the main game the team at Bigmoon Entertainment focused all their effort on simulating this challenge to make it as realistic as possible. It will enhance the already existing world of the main game by additional 12.000 km² including five new stages around the beautiful country side of Argentina. To make sure players do not get lost in the challenging world, the DLC includes brand new road books – again based on the original materials handed out to the drivers during the event.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1knw.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Deep Silver","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bigmoon Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":114793,"name":"Tasty Town","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1j2j.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"2K Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Social Point","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":114795,"name":"Apex Legends","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Conquer with character in Apex Legends, a free-to-play Hero shooter where legendary characters with powerful abilities team up to battle for fame & fortune on the fringes of the Frontier.\n\nMaster an ever-growing roster of diverse Legends, deep tactical squad play and bold new innovations that go beyond the Battle Royale experience—all within a rugged world where anything goes.
