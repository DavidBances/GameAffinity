The numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of \"4 8 3\" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups.\nTo solve a puzzle, one needs to determine which cells will be boxes and which will be empty. Determining which cells are to be left empty (called spaces) is as important as determining which to fill (called boxes). Later in the solving process, the spaces help determine where a clue (continuing block of boxes and a number in the legend) may spread. Solvers usually use a dot or a cross to mark cells they are certain are spaces.\nIt is also important never to guess. Only cells that can be determined by logic should be filled.

There is one place in particular where the sky is darker than anywhere else: the ruins of the Engine city New York, perpetually shrouded in grey clouds and polluted rain. Five years ago, a mysterious disaster known as the \"Great Disappearance\" reduced this entire metropolis to a deserted, crumbling wasteland. Sealed off from the world by the United States government, it stands in utter silence. Not a single soul now walks its streets. But today, a woman named Elysia quietly sets foot inside it - guided by a singular purpose. Her destination: old Manhattan, said to be the epicenter of the catastrophe. Unbeknownst to her... There is a place said to be the city's \"Underground.\" This is an enormous subterranean realm, permeated with a dim purple light. No one on the surface world knows of its existence. In this place, the Skyscrapers that crumbled five years ago still stand tall; but their forms are warped and twisted. \"Underground New York\" is a place of black and violet shadows. A prison with no exit. And beneath its unnatural \"sky,\" the men and women who vanished five years ago still exist... Cowering in fear of the seven monsters known as the \"Messengers.\" Suffering terror, agony, and death at the hands of the \"Messengers.\" They linger on in this twisted underground city, as if waiting for something.

She doesn't even know why she feels this way. But even so, she's absolutely certain. \"Manhattan. The ends of the violet sky.\" \"I have to go there.

The expansion is ‘themed’ in that it concentrates on those areas of policy where governments can influence the make-up of the electorate in subtle low-key ways over the long term. For example, subsidies to bicycles will encourage people to exercise more (in the long run decreasing health costs) and will also encourage less people to own cars and be members of the motorists group. Other policies to encourage entrepreneurship amongst young people will eventually lead to more people becoming self employed, and so on…\n\nA total of 26 policies and 8 dilemmas are included in the expansion, including food labelling, car-pooling, Labor Day bank holiday, witness protection schemes, a diplomatic service, armed forces week, free parenting classes, and much more. The social engineering expansion will allow you see the game as less of a simple win/lose challenge and more of a ‘society sandbox’ that gives you the power to change society over the long run whilst keeping everyone voting for you!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/y4rwptyqrdoon0ztla7c.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":10932,"name":"Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Killer Hornet Resurrection is an intense vertical shooter with a brain train twist.
