The player's ship must also be maneuvered through small holes in a series of walls where fuel cells can be picked up to restore the ship's constantly decreasing fuel supply. If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny. \n \nEach level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear. \n \nEach level of game play consists of two phases: \n \n1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. \n \n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. \n \nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":41987,"name":"Mine Storm II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tread lightly!

Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, and the game has been made more \"extreme\" (laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground). Further, the trademark P-38 has been replaced with a Boeing Stearman E75 N68828.\n\nIn 1991, this version was converted to the PC Engine as simply 1943 Kai, again Japan-only; this version itself contains many additional levels and original music.\n\nThe game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.\n\nAs in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button two performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in 1942, or one of three special attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large \"fuel\" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly \"Pow\" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon.\n\nThere are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in certain direction, player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6xc4.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Capcom","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Naxat Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":42081,"name":"Psycho Chaser","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Psycho Chaser is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shooter.

Subsequent Japan-only sequels would use the same title, which roughly translates as \"Ultimate Tiger\".\n\nThe helicopter comes equipped with a default forward-firing weapon that is able to hit both air and ground targets, as well as a finite supply of bombs which hit enemies in a wide radius for massive amounts of damage. The player can find power-ups by shooting down the relatively sturdy Chinook enemy choppers, which initially allow the player to upgrade their standard gun to include more shots, but will eventually allow them to pick up weapons that can fire in different patterns. These include a four-way shot that fires in the four cardinal directions and a spread shot that fires forwards and outwards in a cone. The player can also find additional bombs by destroying this type of enemy.\n\nAt the end of each stage, and occasionally partway through, is a boss.

Therefore, the game has a 3D aspect to it which makes your mission much harder to complete, especially considering that the controls change accordingly with the different sides of the screen (if you are controlling your robot on the bottom part of the screen all that is needed to move forward is a press \"up\" on the joystick. However, once on the top of the screen, a press \"down\" on the joystick moves you forward). This change of joystick movement helps create a more realistic feel that really helps the game out and makes it more fun to play, however frustrating it may be first. After you have the controls for the game down, which can prove to be very tricky, the next step is to go about completing your mission to get back all the of the Earth's Energy Crystals, which are represented by little red diamonds throughout the 3D maze. However, there are a few curve balls thrown in. If you are unable to collect the crystals after 40 seconds, they become radioactive. This means that if you touch a crystal once it's radioactive (they turn white after becoming so) you will lose a life and fall off into space towards a purple alien ship which appears in the center of the screen. On the other hand, if you do collect all 4 crystals from that round, you might think your job is done, but that's not the case. Even after all the crystals are collected you must still blast the white androids which follow you throughout the maze. Only after all of the androids have been killed will you be able to advance forward. \n \nThe robot you control in the game is also equipped with an electronic vapor gun that will shoot a pulsar beam all the way around the screen which can actually come back and hit you if not careful (and the range of your shot increases as the game progresses, so an accurate hit is necessary later on!). When you do manage to hit one of the androids through they do not simply vanish from the screen, but instead leave behind an energy mass which cannot be passed through by your robot. On later levels when there are many androids roaming about the screen a well planned shot is necessary, because you could actually cage yourself in due to the energy masses. However, there is a way out of a jam if you find that all the crystals have turned radioactive (and therefore cannot be collected) or if you find yourself caged in by energy masses. By the press of a button, you can Beam Up to your yellow ship and then be presented with a fresh board and start all over (but then you lose any crystals you might have managed to collect and the game gets a little harder). One other thing to note about the androids is the fact that they can shoot anti-gravity spray at you, so getting out of the way of their line of fire is another challenge faced on your quest to save the earth. One last little nifty feature of the game is the ability to wear a defensive shield which makes you invincible to anything on the screen. However, the shield can only be used for as long as the red bar on the top of the screen indicates (you actually can take off the shield at any point after putting it on to save the energy bar from being depleted). The shield, and all these other little bonuses tossed into the game, can all be accessed by either the press of the button or by voice recognition if the MBX gaming add-on is attached. All one would need to do in order to activate the shield, for example, would be to simply say \"Shield\" into the microphone! \n \nSpace Bandits is a very interesting game, and has a lot of unique features. However, the mainstream gamer might be turned off a little by the easiness of the first few rounds. At first I wrote this game off as being too easy, but after playing it through to the 5th level I found myself being caged in numerous times by the androids who were out to get the crystals I had collected! So when you give this game a try, play into it a little as the challenge can pick up fairly quickly. In addition, as with all MBX cartridges, this game uses voice recognition and synthesis very well. Being able to speak plain English into a microphone to tell your robot what to do is really a great added dimension to the game. So if you're a space shoot 'em up junkie, you might find all the options available in Space Bandits interesting and entertaining.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Texas Instruments TI-99"}]},{"id":42177,"name":"Sneggit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Sneggit, you control a chicken trying to gather up eggs from the barnyard before the snakes get them!

According to Dave, Sewermania was MB President Jim Shea's favorite game out of all the MBX titles that were in development.\n\nAccording to early promotional material, the generator located in the upper left corner of the screen was intended to flood the sewer and kill all the rats. This would help the player in locating the bomb since there would be no rats to avoid for a few seconds (although the alligator would still be lurking around). In the released version of the game, however, the generator's functionality was removed making it impossible to flood the sewer. According to programmer Dave Landon the reason for the removal was because the game was initially developed for MB's own video game unit before being brought over the TI-99/4A (read the MBX development history by clicking the link in the above Trivia section). The TI-99/4A's cartridges were smaller in size apparently to what Milton Bradley had envisioned for its own system, so to meet memory constraints the functionality of the generators had to be removed.\n\nThis game can be used with Milton Bradley's MBX System (an add-on for the TI-99/4A). The MBX allowed for the use of Voice Recognition, improved Speech Synthesis, a 360° Analog Joystick, and an Action-Input Keypad for video games designed for it.\n\nEaster Egg Alert! At the beginning of the game the phrase \"Dave, find the bomb\" is spoken aloud by the MBX system or the Speech Synthesizer (depending on if you have an MBX system or not).

Continuing their policy of providing educational material that is both instructional and entertaining, the staffs of Scott, Foresman and Company and the Texas Instruments Learning Center expand their mathematics series to include the Multiplication 1 Solid State Software™ Command Module. The Multiplication 1 module shows your child the \"Magic of Multiplication\". It provides a strong foundation not only in the basic facts, but also in later work with larger numbers. Colorful graphics and lively music transform the learning of factors and products into an exciting experience — almost like magic! The Multiplication 1 module contains eight activities: \n- EQUAL GROUPS changes an addition problem into a multiplication problem using the concept of number grouping. \n- FACTORS 2 TO 5 explains horizontal multiplication problems for factors 2 through 5. \n- FACTORS 0 TO 5 demonstrates multiplication of a factor by 2, 1, and then 0 (zero). \n- FACTORS 6 TO 9 increases the multiplication skills to include the factors 6 to 9. \n- MULTIPLY ANOTHER WAY presents a smooth transition from the horizontal multiplication problem to the vertical problem. \n- HOW MANY IN ALL uses a random number of hats \"sprouting\" a random number of flowers to demonstrate solving for the product. \n- COMPLETE THE BOX provides one factor while your child selects the other and then solves for the missing number (the product of the two factors). \n- REVIEW THE FACTS offers 28 multiplication problems with factors 0 (zero) to 9. A stage is set complete with a magician and audience that stands up each time your child correctly answers the displayed problem. \n \nThe Multiplication 1 module advances your child to more difficult drills according to the number of correct responses given in each activity. The computer automatically advances to the next activity if your child answers 80 percent of the drill problems correctly. If less than 60 percent of the problems are answered correctly, the computer returns to the appropriate activity, providing your child with more practice. This automation helps alleviate anxieties caused by consistently incorrect responses, making the learning of mathematical skills a pleasurable and rewarding experience. With this module, Texas Instruments continues its tradition of applying innovative Solid State Speech™ technology to educational activities. Multiplication 1 is designed to work with or without the Texas Instruments Solid State Speech™ Synthesizer (sold separately). However, the Speech Synthesizer must be attached to activate the voice of the computer. The computer's voice then gives directions, reads the equations, and encourages your child to \"Try again\" when he or she gives an incorrect answer. The addition of speech strengthens the learning process since your child can hear, as well as see, the correct answers.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":42185,"name":"Burger Builder","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Burger Builder is an action platform game similar to BurgerTime.

One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword.

If Kirby (the ball) hits the ground when the star counter is higher than zero, he will bounce once, so the player gets one more chance to catch him. Otherwise, the player loses a life. Every time Kirby touches the ground, the star counter is reduced by 10.\n\nOnce the player clears the first five stages, King Dedede appears in stage 6. This stage has no blocks, so the player's star counter cannot increase. Dedede throws hammers from time to time - if Rick is hit, the player will not be able to control him for a short while.

The hero's solar system has been invaded by a group of yellow balls wearing triangular shades, and he jumps into action to send them packing.\n\nSupapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid, but offers a few twists of its own, like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the \"paddle\"'s intrinsic elasticity, and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks.\n\nThe goal of the game is to reflect a ball of energy around a table, ensuring that it doesn't fall off the bottom of the screen. Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen, which is common for other games of this type, the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen, however.\n\nOccasionally, items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle, adding more balls, extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars, the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle, causing more damage to blocks. If the player finds four stars, this charged up bounce will clear the screen.\n\nSkulls can often drop from blocks too, and collecting these will lower a green gauge at the side of the screen, which operates as a combined timer/health bar.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co307w.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Yutaka","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NOW Production","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":42325,"name":"Puzzle'n Desu!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A puzzle game for the Super Famicom where the hero has to push blocks across a grid to complete lines of the same color.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3rpv.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nichibutsu","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":42326,"name":"The Great Battle II: Last Fighter Twin","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Heroes unite!

Naturally, this premise was adapted into a one-on-one fighting game.\n\nThe game includes 10 different Gundams (one of which can only be selected by players via a secret code), each with its own arena and background music. Four different playing modes are on offer:\nStory Battle allows a limited selection of only five Gundams (the members of the Shuffle Alliance in the series), presenting a series of nine matches against all other Gundams in the game. All matches consist of only one round.\nVersus Battle is for two-player matches. Players choose their Gundam, its pilot (different pilots have different attributes regarding performance, defence and speed) and arena. Both players can select the same Gundam (with the exception of the secret character) and pilot. Matches are best-of-three. Handicaps can be set for each player.\nChampionship Battle is similar to Story Battle, but is in best-of-three mode, allows Gundam selection from the full roster and lacks story sequences.\nTeam Battle is a team-based two-player mode. Players select between one to five Gundams per team. One-round matches follow, with the loser being removed from the roster until only one team remains.\nControls involve the four face buttons for weak and strong punches and kicks, and the two shoulder buttons for quick forward or backward dashes. Each Gundam has its own special moves triggered via input combinations, including extra powerful \"desperation attacks\", which can only be activated if the Gundam's life bar has been significantly lowered and flashes red.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8b9f.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Pandora Box","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":42372,"name":"Little Master: Niji Iro no Maseki","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":42373,"name":"GS Mikami: Joreishi ha Nice Body","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ghost Sweeper Mikami: Joreishi ha Nice Body is a side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Reiko through multiple stages.

Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control. To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air. He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth. As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity. What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too. This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you. If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn). Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co305c.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"St. GIGA","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"AI","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Satellaview"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":42410,"name":"Ranma 1/2: Ougi Jaanken","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which fall three at a time.

The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit.

There is also a special power up that can destroy all enemies on screen if it's destroyed (like Darius II) or can make the Silver Hawk shoot a powerful laser beam if its grabbed by the player.\n\nThere is no power up bar, which means that if a Silver Hawk is destroyed, the shots and bombs are powered down to the minimum level. Also, when the player loses a ship on a stage, it is returned to the 'check point' (not identify in game) of that stage, if the ship has lost during a boss also return the last 'check point' before the boss appear.\n\nLike Darius Twin, the player uses (by default) the Y button for shot and the B button for dropping bombs. As long as the player keeps pressed both buttons, the shots are powered down one level. The player can switch between bombs and side laser guns by pressing the R button.\n\nThe stages map for this game is very different of the rest of the Darius games.

If the player collects the scattered letters that appear in every stage that spell out the name Jerry, the player will earn two extra lives.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5zai.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Imagesoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Epic/Sony Records","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Game Freak","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"System Sacom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":42462,"name":"Slayers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Slayers is a role-playing video game adaptation of the Slayers light novel series developed by BEC and published by Banpresto for the Super Famicom (SNES) exclusively in Japan in 1994.\n\nPowerful, avaricious sorceress Lina Inverse travels around the world, stealing treasures from bandits who cross her path.

Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5zaf.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":42467,"name":"Rival Turf!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rival Turf is a cyber-punk comic-book style beat 'em up inspired by the likes of Streets of Rage and Final Fight.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5z9i.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"HAMSTER","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Jaleco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]}]
