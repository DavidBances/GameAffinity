The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking. There was also a more basic upright cabinet version.\n\nAfter Burner II has been translated and ported to numerous home computers, consoles and mobile phones; including versions for the PC Engine, Sharp X68000, Sega Mega Drive, Famicom, FM Towns Marty, Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Sega Saturn.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\n\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\n\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\n\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga and Sega Genesis.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4i0c.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":21549,"name":"Shanghai II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shanghai II is a Puzzle game, developed and published by SunSoft, which was released in Japan in 1990.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7n4b.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Game Gear"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"}]},{"id":19503,"name":"Hellfire","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the year 2998, humanity has finally reached the stars, and was able to build a prosperous, peaceful society.

Finally, the old king finds out that a goddess called \"Medusa\" tries to control the people from out of the underworld, in order to conquer and rule the entire world with her army from hell.\nThe player who takes the role of the prince is forced to stop Medusa's advance and to reunite the split kingdom. To reach that, he must fight against the goddess Medusa and defeat her again. As the opponent is a goddess, the player is not able to find her anywhere in the country. He can only call her when he finds 5 rings, puts them together in a temple and forces Medusa to face a fight. The basic task is therefore the search for the 5 rings. Unfortunately the king has very little energy, and so the starting conditions for his son do not look very good. First he has to earn some money to afford an army which is necessary to find the rings. This causes more problems, which the player realizes and includes in the course of the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/p9mhisya70hzas6kalgx.jpg","releaseYear":1989,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14483,"name":"Windwalker","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The goal is distant, the test arduous.
