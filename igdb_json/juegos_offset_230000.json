Players will need to time their attacks carefully to take down enemies without getting hit themselves.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Galeão's Dreams is to defeat Galeão's evil brother, Peter, and his henchmen, Galebot, the Slippers, and TokTok. Peter's motivation for attacking DreamsLand is simple: he wants to take over the world and plunge it into darkness. Galeão is the only one who can stop him, and he'll need to use all his skills and abilities to save the day.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6g7d.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"RGS Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":248376,"name":"Combat Master","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A fast-paced and performance-focused modern warfare first person shooter.

Once you've brought the chickens through the pie machine, you'll be back in the farmyard with a new bunch of chickens and all new challenges ahead of you. You'll have to avoid obstacles such as dogs, cameras, spotlights, and others, as you make a break for freedom. You can push objects, shut off power, or find shortcuts to get around the many obstacles. And don't forget to keep an eye out for objects you can use to your advantage. You can also use a password to continue your chicken-saving quest another time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9btw.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Blitz
