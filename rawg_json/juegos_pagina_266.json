We have dubbed it a 'puzzle shooter' because we think we're clever. It combines classic point and click gameplay with rail shooter elements, strong characters, and a deep well thought out setting in which water is more valuable than blood.\nA vibrant yet dying world for you to explore...The world of Dead Horizon is not one of infinite frontiers.  It is a setting of pain and bones bleached white by a world that wants nothing more than to consume what few people are left on its surface. Yet, those people still live their lives, have their own stories, dreams, and aspirations. A dying world doesn't mean that people don't live.\nThe Hard Sell...Dead Horizon is a game with one foot firmly in the past: adventure games, the 90s, pixel art and some older design philosophies. However, it is also a game with one foot firmly in the future: interaction, immersion, cinematic storytelling, and reactive dialogues. By taking the style and lessons of the past and combining them with both modern game design elements and a love of storytelling, we've tried to create something beautiful.\nDead Horizon is a labor of love. A love of storytelling, of pixel art, of westerns, of so many things. A love of gamers and games. Of the people who have come before and everyone that will come after.\nWe hope you are willing to celebrate this love with us.
