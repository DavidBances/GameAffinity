After level two, the player can choose the order of the next three stages. In addition, the player can collect \"E\" capsules by destroying certain enemies. Collecting fifteen will permanently upgrade one of the available weapons on the power-up bar.

The bad news: Dr. Wily shows up to ruin the fun, and basically everything at the festival tries to kill our hero. Mega Man must conquer an array of eclectic challenges in order to restore peace!\n\nInspired by the Super Mario-themed Make a Good Level contests, this is the game that launched the largest and most ambitious Mega Man fangame series ever. In contrast with later installments, MaGMML1 is built in Blyka's Engine, contains a small number of contestant-submitted levels, gives the player a limited number of lives, and has relatively few extras and special features. The judging rubric, copied from Make a Good Level Contest X2, is borderline incomprehensible. The special weapons, decided by popular vote, are somewhat redundant due to how the voting was set up. Arguably the biggest distinguishing feature, however, is that the game is absolutely full of bugs.\n\nRegardless of the quirks, the game still built the foundation for the bigger and more polished games that followed it. Five people judge levels based on certain criteria, levels are placed into tiers, Wily levels are made by the judges, and everything is compiled into a big game in the end. On top of that, the game is full of humor (intentional and otherwise), and there are several memorable (and infamous) levels that any fan of the series should experience at least once. History must be preserved! Play at your own risk - there are loads of glitches and the whole game is full of jank.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4iti.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":192402,"name":"Make a Good Mega Man Level Contest 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The good news: Mega Man's heroics are once again being celebrated with a festival, this one even bigger than the last!

Just enjoy all the creative, wacky, unique, and unusual simulations the festival has to offer, and say hello to that mysterious figure who seems to be watching you...\n\nMaGMML2 expands and improves on MaGMML1 in almost every way. Built in Mega Engine and subjected to more extensive playtesting, the game runs smoothly (you can actually ride Rush Jet this time!) and offers several new configuration options. The judging rubric has been refined, and judge comments cover the highs and lows of each level in greater depth. A new collectible and many more assets were available to the level designers, allowing for even more variety in the gameplay. Several features have been added to keep things fresh, and there's enough bonus content to keep you entertained long after you've completed the contestant-submitted levels.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4itk.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":192403,"name":"Californication","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Game inspired by the \"Californication\" video clip by Red Hot Chili Peppers.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4itl.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Miquel Camps Orteza","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":192404,"name":"Elo 1100 Chess","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Play from beginners level to top level ELO 1100 (very good level, if you beat your device here, respect!) in this high quality Chess Game Engine.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co57mi.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":192405,"name":"Red Wings: Coloring Planes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Zoom across the page in a blaze of color and paint the most memorable and exciting planes of WWI in Red Wings: Coloring Planes!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5aqn.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":192406,"name":"Simple Mini Golf","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Simply mini golf, playable up to 8 players!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5asg.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":192407,"name":"FPV Simulator","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Feel the rush of a racing drone and the freedom of flying like a bird trying to defy the laws of gravity.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co57o5.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":192408,"name":"#1 Pastime Bundle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Enjoy 3 great games in 1 with this bundle containing #1 Crosswords, #1 Anagrams, and #1 Sudokus. #1 Crosswords In #1 Crosswords you'll find a story mode with 100 crossword puzzles to solve for all difficulty levels.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co56yc.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":192409,"name":"Educational and Learning Bundle: 5 in 1","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This bundle contains five of top educational games for toddlers and kids.
