Ragen, a soldier in the House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance. However, he was discovered, and the Dark Wing took their revenge: somehow, they had learned the location of the Ragen family's residence. Under cover of night they attacked, killing everyone. Only young Herras, who was at a friend's house at the time of the massacre, survived. Unbeknownst to him, the Dark Wing made an agreement that after the strike, they would separate for ten years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations. Now, in 3027, that time is up. Herras, who has become a young man, has waited the last decade for his chance to take revenge. As a mercenary MechWarrior operating from the planet Galatea, with a light 'Mech in the hangar and 50.000 C-Bills in the bank, he will accept any mission that will lead him closer to finding the murderers of his family.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3g97.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Beam Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":19189,"name":"MechWarrior 2: Ghost Bear's Legacy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"MechWarrior 2: Ghost Bear's Legacy is the follow up expansion pack for MechWarrior 2, that gives the player a chance to play as the Clan Ghost Bear.

It turns out that Eggman Nega (once again masquerading as Doctor Eggman) has stolen the Chao and concealed them inside a haunted mansion. His plan is to feed them to an inter-dimensional beast called the \"Ifrit\" who needs to eat them to become invincible . After that, he plans to release the Ifrit into the world in order to destroy it. However, to open the portal to the Ifrit's world, the seven Chaos Emeralds are required. Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it.\nMeanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega's plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Professor Gerald Robotnik's journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way.\n\nAll of the teams meet up at the Mystic Haunt Zone where the portal to the Ifrit's world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic defeat the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit's dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble.\n\nSonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs, and Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future. Espio has to answer to Vector the Crocodile who has spent their client's advanced payment on late rental fees.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zvl.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Backbone Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Studio USA","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":19263,"name":"Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7rhs.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Gameloft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":19264,"name":"Norse Noir: Loki's Exile","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A classic style, hand-drawn adventure game, where the roaring 20s and Scandinavian mythology collide!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/huuxad1jvnrpdrl1gfsu.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kreative Spill","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":19266,"name":"Tenchu: Fatal Shadows","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Two black-clad ninjas, Ayame and Rin, silently stalk enemies and strike with brutal Stealh kills in revenge for the massacre of Rin's village.

It is based on Spacewar!, a PDP-1 program. It was ported to the Vectrex in 1982.\nSpace Wars was the brainchild of Larry Rosenthal, an MIT graduate who was fascinated with the original Spacewar! and developed his own custom hardware and software so that he could play the game. Cinematronics worked with Rosenthal to produce the Space Wars system.\nTwo players controlled different ships. One button rotated the ship left, another rotated the ship right, one engaged thrust, one fired a shell, and one entered hyperspace (which causes the ship to disappear and reappear elsewhere on the playfield at random).\nThe game offered a number of gameplay options, including the presence or absence of a star in the middle of the playfield (which exerted a positive or negative gravitational pull), whether the edges of the playfield \"wrapped around\" to their opposite sides, and whether shells bounced. Three other fascinating features were unique to this game. First, the game could not be played in \"one player\" mode; a human opponent was required. Second, the player's ship could take a glancing hit without dying, but would suffer damage; a cloud of loose ship fragments would break off and float away, after which the ship would be visibly damaged on screen and would turn and accelerate more slowly. Third and most memorable was that the duration of play for any contest was solely governed by the amount of money deposited; each quarter bought a minute and a half of play. A dollar bought six minutes, and for a ten dollar roll of quarters two players could play non-stop for an hour.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ud3.jpg","releaseYear":1977,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Cinematronics","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Cinematronics","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega, S.A.
