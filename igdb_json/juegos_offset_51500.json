The U.S. government decided that a large-scale attack would prove risky, and so a small group of Special Forces was formed...\n\n\"Only one machine is fit for such a task...\"\n\nIn this simulator the player controls an AH-64 Apache, the \"primary attack helicopter in the U.S. Arsenal\". It can be controlled from 5 different points of view, including 1st (inside the cockpit) and 3rd person ones. The on screen display holds valuable information to the pilot, such as damage meters, status of engines, rotor brakes, wheel brakes and hover, air speed, altitude, compass, radar, RPM, Torque, Fuel and more.\n\nThe game features two control systems: arcade and physics mode. In arcade mode the helicopter maintains altitude while flying forward, while the physics mode is based on real world physics, thus, when the helicopter is moving forward, it will also lose altitude if the motor power isn't increased. The helicopter can be controlled either with a keyboard/mouse combo or with a joystick.\n\nThe AH-64 comes equipped with 3 different types of weapons: Hellfire Missiles, m230 Chain Gun 30mm Automatic Cannon and Hydra Rockets. There is also a fourth kind of weapon, the Zuni Rockets, only available later in the game. Hellfire missiles are target lockable and the Cannon can be aimed with the mouse.\n\nThere are 30 unique missions in this game; in most of them the player must accomplish several objectives, usually destroying enemy buildings and vehicles. The game can be saved at the end of each mission, but not during them. If the player gets killed during a mission, he must start it all over again, but the number of tries is unlimited.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ts4.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":55975,"name":"4NR","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"4NR is a discovery-based puzzle platformer.

After swooping around a bit, the enemies will exit the screen (usually from the bottom, though sometimes from the sides) and loop back around to the top. This will continue until Stanley dies, shoots Donkey Kong to the top of the screen, thus completing it, or kills the five insects, all of which take two hits apiece to kill. If Stanley kills all five insects before any of them loop back to the top of the screen, a flag reminiscent of one from Rally-X will appear, and shooting it will net him 1,000 points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co217q.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"FM-7"},{"id":0,"name":"NEC PC-6000 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"}]},{"id":56219,"name":"Sumikko Gurashi: Mura wo Tsukurun Desu","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The third Sumikko Gurashi game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jexac8qai3j7gchvebwx.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nippon Columbia","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":56220,"name":"Konami Game Collection Bangai-hen","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This is the fifth of five Konami's Game Collections released on a 3.5\" diskette.
