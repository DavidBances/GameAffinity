Only Skye can set things right once again. She will face an assortment of fantasy characters and creatures in her journeys as she makes her way through 30 missions set across five different game worlds. It is notable that, like some other releases from publisher Simon and Schuster (including the Boston Animation-developed M&M's: The Lost Formulas), this game features prominent product placement in the form of Skittles brand fruit-flavored candies. Indeed, it is the mystic power of Skittles that moves Skye through more than one threatening game situation. In spite of any potential incongruities of featuring a familiar consumer item in a fantasy world, Darkened Skye strives to provide the graphical competence, engrossing story, and state-of-the-art play that gamers expect from a major 2002 release. ~ T.J.

The enemies of the game are the United Eastern States, who are believed to be building terrorist training camps and factories for weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe game is similar in many respects to ThunderHawk: Operation Phoenix. However, in Fire Blade, the player is forced to be far less cautious unless on a stealth mission and is usually pitted against far larger amounts of enemies. The main element of the game is aggressively piloting the player's attack helicopters against large enemy armored formations and completing the main mission objectives, these vary in creativity from simply blowing up a bridge to aiding a special forces team in stopping a train by parking a truck across the tracks and stopping enemy troops from moving it.\n\nA secondary element of the game is FPS-style sniping, when the player's helicopter enters \"stealth mode\" the autocannon is used as a precision sniper weapon that can be used to accurately target individual soldiers, allowing the player to snipe enemy infantry much like in an FPS.\n\nAdditional fuel and ammunition for the helicopter's jet boosters and heavier armaments are acquired from destroyed enemy vehicles instead of the more conventional reloading areas from games such as the Strike Series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ov8.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kuju Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Midway Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":3917,"name":"Flushed Away","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Flushed Away lets players relive the movie and beyond as they assume the roles of Roddy, Rita and take the wheel of the Jammy Dodger watercraft.

Once unlocked, the eight levels seamlessly connect with one another to form one sprawling environment. Within each region are special events entitled Big Air, Freestyle, Hill Climb, and Race, which typically involve performing as many aerial stunts as possible to outscore the competition.\n\nFreestyle MetalX also features a number of sub-games to add some diversity to the racing action. Players will ride off a cliff to see how many tricks they can perform during their rapid decent, become a human dart while hurling themselves toward an enormous dartboard, and even participate in a game of motocross pinball. Those tired of the existing courses can create their own arena using the built-in level editor.

Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives.

Originally released in 1998 for the PlayStation, the game follows Sir Daniel Fortesque, a skeletal knight accidentally resurrected to battle the sorcerer Zarok and save the kingdom of Gallowmere.\n\nThe game takes place across a variety of levels, many of which require certain objectives to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\n\nDan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan's health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has.

NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller.

The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero's Handbook\" and Harry's off to adventure. The \"Hero's Handbook's\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are.

At random times in battle, the icon of your specific spirit will flash, in which if you press either O or X fast enough, your overall spirit meter will rise.

In Story mode, you will experience various cutscenes and additional minigames. Arcade mode seems to be the same except for the fact that you will be continuously battling. Of course within Vs mode, you can battle against a friend or a com. Overall within this game, 17 characters are playable (3 of which being different versions of Yoh). It is known that Hao can also be playable, but a Gameshark code is needed. Fortunately, as well within battle, character voices will be experienced rather commonly, in which anime cutscenes will be experienced at times - such as in the intro.

In it, players assume the role of Millennia, a young girl being used as a puppet and guard for a race known as Timenoids (or TMD, as the game abbreviates their race's name), who are like humans except immortal, and whose power is desired by the humans whose lives they govern. Millennia finds herself in the middle of the war between her own race and her captors, with her chosen side dictated by the player. One of the endings to the game heavily implies that Kagero is a prequel to Tecmo's Deception, and that Millennia will grow up to become Astarte from the first game; this interpretation is supported by the fact that naming the main character in Kagero \"Astarte\" lets you start with a hefty sum of extra Ark (the game's currency). However, Tecmo has not made it clear if that ending is canon.\n\nThe change in how traps functioned gave this game a much more strategic edge than the first game, with traps able to interact with one another in long strings that could be likened to Rube Goldberg set-ups, just much more lethal and involving other people. Instead of using items such as medicinal herbs, healing was accomplished via glowing blue crystals called \"loons\" which could only be touched once before breaking, never to be used again in a given chapter. Trap improvement was conducted by using the points earned after successfully killing each invader, called Ark, and by following a somewhat logical \"tree\"—improving an Arrow Slit after a Lightning Rod was created could make a Laser Arrow, for instance. Six secret traps (one of which depicted Suezo, a popular monster from Tecmo's own Monster Rancher titles) could be unlocked in future replays by completing the game and achieving all four endings in the game, as well. Traps, when constructed, could be used as often as the player liked, but required a recharge time between uses in any given level. Game saves are one block in size.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co23vs.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":4125,"name":"Jeremy McGrath Supercross 98","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Jeremy McGrath Supercross '98 is a racing video game for PlayStation developed by Probe Entertainment and published by Acclaim Entertainment.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/uisydcweydupdsf23qqw.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Acclaim Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Probe Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":4126,"name":"Intelligent Qube","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Intelligent Qube is a puzzle game for the PlayStation.
