It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. The main characters' quest is to investigate mysterious \"windows\" from which vicious monsters pop out.\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes, as well as many other actions throughout the game. A new \"Stock\" system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts - Covenant and enables double attacks.\n\nThe \"Stock\" system works by filling up a character's stock gauge when he/she performs or receives an attack. A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored. Stock can then be utilized in many ways. For example, doing a Double attack (a character performs two action on the same turn) or starting a Combo consumes one Stock. A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock. The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts: Covenant, with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available.\n\nMagic returns in the form of Stellar Charts, where characters equip Stellars onto the chart. The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs. Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar, the strongest non-elemental magic in the game.\n\nFusion is also back in the game, albeit quite differently. Unlike Yuri, Shania does not possess the power of the Harmonixer where she is able to fuse into different demons. She makes spirit pacts with the different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform. Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes; statues of different animals, she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up.\n\nSnapping photos is more emphasized in this game. Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies, he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes. Johnny can also draw upon the power of Malice to transform; though this ability comes rather late in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2hz3.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"XSEED Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Aruze","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nautilus","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ghostlight Ltd.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":4173,"name":"ATV Quad Power Racing 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"ATV Quad Power Racing is the sequel to ATV Quad Power Racing on the Playstation, with many new features: Choose from 10 of the top professional riders from all over the world, including Dana Creech, Kory Ellis and Tim Farr.

These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI.

It was initially released for the PC-9821 computer platform in 1994, followed by remade versions for the 3DO in 1995, and the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, despite plans for an English localization of the Saturn version. On August 24, 2009 (in honor of the 46th birthday of the game designer, Hideo Kojima), an unofficial English translation patch was released onto the internet.\n\nThe game is set in a primarily first person perspective and uses a point-and-click interface: the player can move the cursor and have the protagonist (Jonathan Ingram) analyze objects around his environment or talk to other characters in the game. Like in Snatcher, the game features shooting segments where the player must defend their character from incoming enemies. The player can use the shooting trainer at the police department to test their reflex and accuracy. There are numerous puzzles in the game, including an event where the player must dismantle a bomb by following their partner's instructions.\n\nThe console versions of the game all include support for their respective mouse peripherals. The Saturn version features light gun support for the shooting segments.\n\nThe game was notable for being an early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a theme revolving around space exploration and occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to Snatcher, but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. Policenauts also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player's memory of the plot upon reloading a save, an element Kojima would later use in Metal Gear Solid. The PlayStation version of Policenauts could also read the memory card and give some easter egg dialogues if a save file of Konami's dating sim Tokimeki Memorial is present, a technique Kojima would also later use in Metal Gear Solid.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co720g.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"3DO Interactive Multiplayer"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":4291,"name":"Supreme Warrior","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Supreme Warrior is a full-motion video fighting game.

After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA).

A counter indicates the level of shield that you have: when it reaches zero then any contact with an alien is deadly whether you are on the 'Shield Line' or not.\nThe idea of the game is to cut areas out of the screen without touching any of the aliens. This is done by pressing the SPACE key which initiates the 'Laser Cutter' and moving off the 'Shield Line' and rejoining it somewhere else. While you are in the process of drawing a line, your shield is inactive and touching an alien is fatal. Similarly, if one of the aliens touches the line then it will send a charge down the line towards you and you must quickly return to the safety of the edge before it reaches you.\n\nWhen you rejoin the 'Shield Line' the area that does not contain the 'Boss' alien will be filled (points are gained by trapping the other aliens) and the 'Shield Line' will be adjusted to surround the area that is left. The level is completed when a certain percentage of the total area has been filled in.

While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.\n\nJavelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well\nCycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling.\n\nLike with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to ten human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from). It's also possible to replay and even store your best (or worst) moments.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ny7hxotmoayg7xnehseb.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Accolade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MindSpan","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":4511,"name":"Bonanza Bros.","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Just who are these guys?\n\nMobo and Robo are the coolest villains you'll ever meet- they rob banks, museums (and innocent computer gamers of their sanity).

Each level contains a number (usually two) of mid-bosses known as \"middle ghosts\"; after a middle ghost is defeated, it turns into a small green ghost which can be captured for extra money by luring it over a ghost trap. Between levels, money can be used to buy powerups, such as a 3-way shot or recovery items.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4tut.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tec Toy","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"}]},{"id":4535,"name":"TechnoClash","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A top-down action RPG with over seven levels to explore.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2rjv.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"}]},{"id":4536,"name":"Jewel Master","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An army of demons terrorizes the land.

The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely.

Players will be an important part of the game with Motion Animation Stability System (M.A.S.S.), that will increase the realism of physical contacts between players, tackles and decisions taken on the pitch by the AI to have more open games. The audience will have an influence on the performance of the team. On the pitch, the performance of an individual player, good or bad, will also have an effect on the team, giving them a moral boost if he has a moment of individual brilliance; or forcing his teammates to support him if he is not doing well.\n\nIntroduced in PES 2013, the Player ID system recreated faithfully the movements and skills of about 50 star players. In PES 2014, that number is increased and will also apply to complete squads to replicate a team's playing style. With the new Combination Plan, users will be able set up a variety of different tactics in key areas of the pitch using three or more players. These players will make very different runs to exploit holes in the defense or midfield, using the flanks, curved runs, or overlapping play to make themselves available.\n\nNew for this year, players can now change teams in the Master League and coach a national side. Players are also able to create 3rd and 4th kits. Some third and fourth kits are official. The PS2 version has the same characteristics of the other versions.
