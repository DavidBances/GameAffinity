It was released in Japan on September 12, 2009 bundled with every copy of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and then later released with every localized copy of the games. The accessory has a Poké Ball design with a small monochrome LCD screen and three functioning buttons. The Pokéwalker supports infrared signals allowing players to interact within a short range with a game card of Pokémon HeartGold or SoulSilver while slotted in the Nintendo DS, or with another Pokéwalker.\n\nThe system records every time a step is taken, and the daily step count influences which wild Pokémon and items will appear. The player can transfer a Pokémon to the Pokéwalker from either HeartGold or SoulSilver, which gains experience for each step. Like the Pokémon Pikachu and Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, the Pokéwalker uses a currency known as \"Watts\" (shortened to w); every 20 steps will earn the player one watt. Players can also catch various Pokémon and obtain items on the device, then transfer them to the game. Alongside the Johto Safari Zone, the Pokéwalker allows for Pokémon normally unavailable until after the player has traveled to Kanto, such as Murkrow, to be available before defeating the Johto League.\n\nMuch as HeartGold and SoulSilver are remakes of the original Gold and Silver, the Pokéwalker could be considered to be somewhat of a remake of Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, which interacted in much the same way with the Generation II games. Unlike Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, however, Pikachu is not the only Pokémon that can be interacted with, and Pokémon can actually be transferred to and from the Pokéwalker at any given time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6yas.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Freak","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Handheld Electronic LCD"}]},{"id":25271,"name":"Wizard's Hat","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Clean up the Magic Glades using your amazing match-three abilities!

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n\nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co53lb.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Budcat Creations","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Vicarious Visions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Neversoft Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":2270,"name":"Canabalt","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Use your Parkour skills to outrun the destruction of your city with just one button!\n\nOne of the most popular and best-loved Flash games of 2010, Canabalt was created in 5 days for the Experimental Gameplay Project, and features a rad soundtrack by superstar indie composer Daniel Baranowsky (Super Meat Boy).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ifw.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Semi Secret Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Finji","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"Ouya"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":175161,"name":"Monkey Preschool Lunchbox","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The #1 preschool game in the app store.

Enemies can, however, move in any direction, and auto-aim is utilized to allow the player to fire at nearby enemies or objects both inside and outside of the 2D plane. The player can use the right control stick to aim with a laser sight. Gameplay in Shadow Complex was inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The gameplay takes many cues from Metroid: the player can move freely throughout the expansive game world, defeating enemies with a variety of weapons, and as they overcome challenges, they gain new abilities and weapons which allow them to reach new areas.\nThe game rewards the player with experience points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic attributes of the character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, they will lose all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any benefits they have already received from that experience.\nIn addition to the main campaign, a number of challenge levels, called \"Proving Grounds\", are available, generally requiring the player to make it to the exit of a room using a limited set of items and health. Players are ranked based on time of completion and any scoring objectives when they complete the level. Scores and other statistics from the main campaign and the training group are tracked via online leaderboards.\nA remastered version and port was announced during the 215 Game Awards, to be released for PS4, Xbox One, PC.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2421.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ChAIR Entertainment Group","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Epic Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":234391,"name":"Enigmata","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An epic space adventure game.

When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first “Haunted House Simulator” where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory.
