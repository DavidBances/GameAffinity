We've completely redesigned the resource gathering. Sieving for resources are a thing of the past. For a more immersive experience, Sky Orchards has been introduced. Resource Trees provides a built-in progression system and lets the player choose the resources they want to produce rather than a randomized system. We've removed the achievement book and replaced it with the advancement system. Instead of requiring players to manually check out what they've accomplished, the game will keep track for you. This system isn't designed to create a required questing system, but rather an optional set of goals for players looking for ideas on what to do next.\n\nSkyFactory 4 introduces the prestige system! This is a completely optional game mode allowing you to unlock mods, items, and mechanics through an open progression system. Prestige points and unlocks are global and can be brought with you to other worlds! Prestige points can be gained by finishing advancements or by using the Parabox, a time-traveling box that generates points.

The amount of mods does not make the modpack sound any better, the main point is to make this big amount of mods to work together and form a clear route that the player can follow to gain progress and fun constantly, instead of facing a lot of mods and don't know what to do. That's what GreedyCraft aims to do - we stage the mods behind a progression system and a questline so the player can clearly know what to do. We make boring and repetitive work that is found in almost every mod optional, and simplify the non-optional ones, so the player don't immediately get boring at the moment they look at the recipes. We also aim to produce chemical reactions between mods, which means when some mods are put together they can provide unexpectedly good results, the third person mode in this modpack is an example. Additionally, we add tons of customized stuff, QoL changes and graphic improvements to make you feel completely different from other modpacks.\n\nIn short, this modpack isn't about putting a lot of mods together and make sure it can run. It's optimized, and heavily modified, adding lots of new custom content and balancing all of the mods together. We aim to make all of these mods work together and form a unique progression system, associations between mods are not just recipes, but in many different ways.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4v5o.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":204703,"name":"Chess '98","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripci√≥n","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4v60.jpg","releaseYear":1998,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Techland","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":204705,"name":"Mini Golf Championship","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mini Golf Championship is a real 3D simulator of the same game.
