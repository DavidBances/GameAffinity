When you encounter a game in the Timeline, you can immediately play it without losing your place.\n\nThe massive list of games spans six original Atari console and home computer platforms and generations of arcade titles, the most ever included in a collection by the team at Digital Eclipse. For the first time ever, games from the cult favorite Atari Jaguar and Atari Lynx platforms will be playable on modern consoles. Behind every game are the stories of Atari, what was happening at the company, what went into the creation of the games and the hardware on which they ran, all told by the people who were there. It is a rare opportunity to get a rich behind-the-scenes look at the history of video games.\n\nIn addition to presenting these Atari classics exactly as they were, the talented team at Digital Eclipse has also created the Reimagined series—six new games that revisit, mash-up and reimagine Atari Classics. Each of these new games is included in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4xgf.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Digital Eclipse","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atari, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":207019,"name":"Conquer the Universe","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Conquer the Universe is a compilation containing the following games:\n\n- Master of Magic\n- Master of Orion\n- X-COM: UFO Defense\n- X-COM: Terror from the Deep\n\nIt also features a Super Sampler CD with demo versions of Grand Prix II and Magic: The Gathering.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co78mo.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MicroProse Software, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":207021,"name":"Final Fantasy VII","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The PC version of Final Fantasy VII is based on an unfinished build of the Japanese version, and therefore contains the same bugs.

They also acquire them through evolution. Your trainer skills also play a role: the better you are as a drill instructor, the more dangerous your troops will be in battle.\n\nAttack is the best defense: Choose a suitable battle strategy!\n\nDepending on the training session and the type of minions, they have different fighting abilities. Some are stronger in attack, some are better in defense. Accordingly, you need a clever battle strategy. Choose the attacking minions for the front lines and the minions with a longer range for the back lines. It's also helpful if you know the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents in the dungeon and choose your battle lineup accordingly.\n\nBefore facing the competition in epic battles, you can try out your minion squad in test campaigns.\n\nBut if your lineup is suitable, you can also send your minions directly into the arena for the first PvE battle. Let's see how good your training was... There are also tournaments in this idle fighting game - those are fought in PvP mode.\n\nWinning the arena will bring you not only higher prestige, but also gold and a better ranking in the league. If you still don't get enough of battling in the dungeon, then create a guild and work together with other guild members to make fat loot.\n\nFame, glory and gold make you an overlord\n\nYour mission in this idle fighting game is to seize the power in the dungeon. You'll achieve this by preparing your minions well for battle. As a trainer, you should also advance your own skills. To do this, you'll use the gold you collect through victories in the arena. Idle missions in the tavern also bring you gold. You can use it to upgrade your trainer skills and those of your minions. Afterwards, you fight your way across the dungeon on a map and encounter different enemies. Use your captured resources wisely while training your minions and you'll soon be able to rule over the monsters of the underworld.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5lec.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NeoBird","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"upjers","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":207128,"name":"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin - Trials of the Dragon King","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"“Trials of the Dragon King” includes new jobs, weapons, accessories, and a new category of equipment, as well as new areas, stories, and challenges.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4zi7.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":207129,"name":"Portable Island: Te no Hira no Resort","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Portable Island: Tenohira Resort is a Japanese Adventure/Simulation where the player spends time on a pretty resort island.
