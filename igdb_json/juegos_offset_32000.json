The Mummy, swathed in bandages and slow but relentless, advances toward you with sinister purpose.\n\nYou are in the midst of an encounter with horror itself.

When four blocks of the same color are connected, they form a tetromino. As the player forms patterns such as multiple same-colored tetrominoes connecting or tetrominos forming a square, a score counter next to the playfield will increase. When the player has a valid points-earning board, they may either finish the round to cash in their points, or continue to build, at the expense of possibly losing points if they fail to raise the value of their board.\n\nThe game can be either played solo or in versus mode against an opponent, either a CPU-controlled or human opponent. Versus-human play can be done either locally or online, with cross-platform play available between Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 players. When playing versus, each round the player whose board is worth more points will damage the opponent's HP with an amount equal to the value of their board. The first player to deplete their opponent's HP wins.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co78lj.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nippon Ichi Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":263252,"name":"Paper Dash: Ghost Hunt","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Start an adventure as a courageous paper plane hunts evil ghosts across vibrant worlds.
