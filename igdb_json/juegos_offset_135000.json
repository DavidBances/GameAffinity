We're talking about a level-based runner inspired by the Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show. That's right, this 2018 comedy revisits the all-time classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT or The Ninja Turtles).\n\nYou get to go on an adventure alongside Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, and Michaelangelo through 50 different missions in which you have to collect coins in order to stop the New York mutants from gaining control over the city. The game is very similar to other classic games such as Subway Surfers or Temple Run as far as the gameplay goes: your character moves horizontally through different lanes by sliding your finger across the screen. You can also jump and slide under objects by swiping up or down.\n\nEach Ninja Turtle includes its own unique attacks, which you can perform by tapping on the screen. There's even a way to customize them more by using these three elements: costumes, weapons, and skills. Earn these unlockables by advancing through the different levels, or by playing with a roulette (but it'll cost a pretty significant amount of coins). With your earnings, you can also level up your characters.\n\nRise of the TMNT: Ninja Run is an incredible videogame that combines endless runners and New York's Ninja Turtles. Shout Cowabunga at the top of your lungs and submerge yourself in a comics universe with the game's eye-catching style.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yj7.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nickelodeon","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":146255,"name":"3D Thunder Ceptor II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A sequel to Thunder Ceptor.

The hero in this game possesses a magical mirror with which he witnesses a duel between his best friend and an unsympathetic aristocrat. After accidentally killing his opponent, he is taken prisoner by the royal guard. The friend now tries to get him freed, but first he has to do a number of quests for the king before his plea will be heard.\n\nThe characters are controlled just like in an RTS or many Western RPGs of that era, for example Baldur's Gate. It's always reccomended to turn on the AI, as manual combat controls are terribly unresponsive. Unfortunately, the gameplay is really slow, and there's not much for the player to do while waiting till the heroes reach the end of a map or kill the inventively designed monsters. Characters can run, but only until their stamina runs out, which happens all too quickly.\n\nThe dialogues in Eryner are fully voiced, and interestingly there are even English subtitles, although they're apparently not translated by a native speaker and completely ignore linebreak rules, and it doesn't seem like the game has ever been published in an English speaking country. Never mind though, because the shoddy QA makes it very much unplayable. The fact that the installation simply doesn't work on modern systems can be worked around, not so much the many severe bugs like missing background graphics, crashes, broken save games and—worst of all—crucial events that just won't be triggered.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yqo.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jamie System Development","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Multi Plus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146379,"name":"Atria II: The Ressurection","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sequel to Jamie's first game also ditches pixel art for render graphics, and puts much more emphasis on the brawler combat, complete with 2-player coop. The overworld is a single screen now, and squares have to be unlocked by using \"map chips\" on them. Dungeons are one screen mazes, too, but you only ever see the character's immediate surroundings, the rest of the building is veiled in darkness. Every step here consumes torches, and the player is forced to leave the dungeon when they run out.\n\nThe combat unfortunately is not that much enhanced over the predecessor, and even feels a little more stiff. Special move input is not very intuitive, and one has to hold the attack button for a second to access spell selection and AI settings in real time.\n\nThe game is also not as story driven, instead the party just runs around menu based villages, takes jobs from local hero guilds and runs around the map for more fighting.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yqq.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jamie System Development","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"KS Media","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146380,"name":"Kakkong: Land of Chaos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yqr.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"KidnKid","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146381,"name":"Boomerang Fighter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yqs.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"KidnKid","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146382,"name":"Drakengard 3: Zero's Prologue","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A prequel to the main chapters of the game about the story of Zero.

It is part of the Wave Jack series of games produced by Imagineer that come with more accessories than the average video game, including a story book and audio cassette tape.\n\nSeiken Psycho Calibur is, in many ways, an attempt to copy the success of The Legend of Zelda. However, it fails to inspire the same level of wonder and fascination. It also lacks a good degree of polish that made the afore mentioned title so great. Nevertheless, Seiken Psycho Calibur is a relatively fun game to play, as long as you have a fair degree of insight into how the game is played. There are some unintuitive aspects of the game that can make progress in the game quite difficult.\n\nFor example, you begin the game in a town which offers a variety of goods for sale, but you only receive so much money, and you can never return to the town once you leave. Therefore, what you decide to invest your money in has a substantial impact on the difficulty of the game early on. Many items can be bought for less money later on, but only if you know the location of the hidden shops that contain them. Other less obvious points in the game require a bit of back tracking from later areas to earlier areas in order to acquire items that allow you to proceed, and boss battles that are at times incredibly difficult.\n\nThis game was fan-translated into English by a user name Toma, who released the patch on December 20, 2000.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yw7.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Imagineer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"C-Lab","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer Disk System"}]},{"id":146455,"name":"Alarm!

New blueprints are gradually made available from the menu at the construction tab.\n\nSome buildings give extra benefits, reducing the cost of materials and training new workers.

Instead Makkoya created their first traditional RPG, with heavy influences from both Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger. While the graphics at times can even be confused with the former at times, the combat system leans more towards the latter. Enemies are seen on the map at all times, but when the heroes approach them, the game switches into an active turn-based combat mode. It lacks the finesse of its role model and interesting features like the combination techs, though.\n\nThe background story is rather silly: A kid wants to play a video game but get smacked in the head by his mother, so he cries himself into the video game somehow. In a world full of strange anthropomorphic characters, he is Zakato, the robotic warrior, and has to team up with two goddesses to fight an evil godess' threat to world peace. On the quest further allusions to Squaresoft games ensue, like a pseudo mode-7 world map flight mode, although the view is completely static, without the little palette animations that made the dragon ride in Secret of Mana so adorable.\n\nThe game unfortunately is heavy on grinding, especially in the beginning stages, where one has to waste a couple of hours to get into shape so one can even reach the other party members. Worst of all, the game's sequence can easily be glitched, and at one point it's almost easier to force oneself to hours of mindless grinding and end up on the wrong path than finding the right one, only noticing the mistake after suddenly people that aren't there start talking in the cutscenes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yza.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":146534,"name":"Cain in the 3rd Earth","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cain in the 3rd Earth is a science fiction role-playing game in Japanese style.

Each of the characters has two objectives: collect food debris and destroy the harmful bacteria that run around the mouth by hurling droplets of toothpaste at them. This ammo is limited, but you can increase it if you find extra toothpaste tubes of matching colour. Also watch out for secrets and bonus tooth care gel tubes that can be found in levels, often in secret places.\n\nThe game is made on a very professional level, with cartoon-like pre-rendered sprites for the characters and the bacteria that look like characters from a kids' TV show. German players call platform games \"jump & run\", and here you'll be doing a lot of jumping and running to a catchy tune. Aro & Elmi can be recommended to players of all ages, and knowledge of German is not required (there will be quizzes between some levels on how to properly brush your teeth, but these will not let you fail even if you give a wrong answer).
