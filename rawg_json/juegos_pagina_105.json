Choose your starting abilities carefully, because they and your wit are the only tools you have in the apocalypse!FeaturesUnique Setting - Near-future, post-apocalyptic Michigan with local cryptids and folklore. And something else beneath the surface...\nTurn-Based Play - Take your time with each turn, and play at your own pace. Save and quit when you want, and resume later.\nPermadeath - If you die, that's it. NEO Scavenger is balanced around a single difficulty level: permadeath. Your save will be deleted if you die. So choose every action carefully!\nNo Grinding - There is no XP in NEO Scavenger. No levelling-up. Instead, progress comes from learning how to play the game better, and using your strengths to your advantage.\nSemi-Random - Much of the map is randomized each game, including the location of ruins, creatures, weather, and certain quest branches.\nSandbox or Story - Search for clues to your identity, what happened, and who's hunting you. Or simply test your mettle against man and nature alike. Play how you want!\nAbilities and Flaws - Choose abilities and flaws each time you play. Different combos unlock different abilities and quest branches.\nCrafting - Extensive crafting system which allows for substitutions of similar items. Make a rifle scope from half a pair of binoculars, or a noise trap from a pill bottle and pebbles.\nDesperate Combat - Detailed combat with moves like \"Tackle,\" \"Lure,\" \"Kick While Down,\" \"Demand Surrender,\" and \"Threaten.\"\nRealistic Wounds - Creatures have complex wound simulation, with multiple wound locations, infection, bleeding, and pain management.\nRealistic Metabolism - Hypothermia, fatigue, thirst, hunger, disease, intoxication, shelter...everything is tracked.\nRealistic Inventory - Complex inventory system with slots for holding, wearing, containers, and more.

Players can also hide their tracks.\nHiding - Players can use hiding to avoid being seen while traveling the map, as well as during story encounters.\nHunting - Trap small game for food and fur, or track and kill larger prey on the map for butchering.\nHacking - Use hacking skills to unlock scavenged laptops, cellphones, smartphones, and tablets. Mine them for paydata, or snoop through personal files.\nForaging - Search for edible plants and water, and use special skills to identify what's safe to eat.\nHaunting Soundtrack - Music composed by Josh Culler, specifically for NEO Scavenger, plays periodically, lending an atmosphere of loneliness and desperation. (Also accessible as mp3s outside game.)\nCreature AI - Wandering creatures go about their own business, hunting, scavenging, and hoarding. Morale affects their choices, and some will gang-up and cause trouble.\nDynamic Weather - Temperature, rainfall, and night/day are based on real-world data for autumn in the area.
