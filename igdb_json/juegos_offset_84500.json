On December 15, 2003, Taito released an updated System 246 version named Battle Gear 3 Tuned and featuring seven extra cars including the Mazda RX-8 Type-S (SE3P) and the Nissan 350Z (Z33). Also, four new tracks (the B courses) including a secret one, were added, as well as an exclusive \"Takumi Mode\". The Takumi Mode gives the player a finishing time/reduced speed penalty each time the car hits a wall. The purpose of this feature is to offer a more realistic and artistic driving experience dixit the developer himself. This principle was used one year later by Polyphony Digital in Gran Turismo 4. By Christmas of the same year, Nextech Entertainment ported Battle Gear 3 to the PlayStation 2 with an opening CG movie, an exclusive \"Event Race\" online contest mode and some extras from the updated version, consisting of four cars (D-Class) and two courses (B). The Battle Gear (BG) franchise has a popular following in Asia due to the continuation of the Side by Side arcade and PlayStation 1990s series. In late 2002, a PAL version of Battle Gear 2 was licensed by Midas Interactive and published as Tokyo Road Race in Europe and Oceania. Both \"Net Ranking\" and \"Network\" modes were removed though. By July 2005, Battle Gear 4 was launched in Japan on Taito's latest 2.5 GHz CPU based Type X+ system board. This new episode introduced official tuned cars such as the Nismo Fairlady S-Tune Z33, Nismo Skyline S-Tune R34 or the Apexi RX-7 FD3S (D1GP'05 version), and even licensed European makers for the very first time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6vdo.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":91878,"name":"RC Racing - Off Road","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":91879,"name":"Khamrai","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Khamrai, you're thrown into a realm where gods and men live among each other; where six nations float through the sky in an uneasy truce; where full-scale war is almost an inevitability.

Rather than a sequel, it is the result of over 20 years of continuous development, and is still largely based on the game's original code.\n\nThe game is nominally a roleplaying game, with a very strict set of rules, character classes and levels. Character progress up a ladder of 11 levels until they reach the traditional Multi-User Dungeon goal of wiz (wizard or witch).\n\nCharacters move between locations, or game rooms, using compass directions, and basic commands such as \"get longsword\", \"get diamond\", \"kill dwarf with longsword\". Points are scored by dropping treasure in the room known as the swamp, killing an NPC, or killing another player. The game also includes magical powers, which are gained through a mystical artifact known as The Touchstone. The small side effect of this is that touching the Touchstone may kill you, with the likelihood of death decreasing as you get higher in level. In order to make Wiz, one must also complete seven of eight tasks.
