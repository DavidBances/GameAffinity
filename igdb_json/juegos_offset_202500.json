Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.\n\nPlaying as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area.

The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future. Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that \"they\" left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox.

The Cyberball series is a sci-fi imagining of American Football featuring giant robots as players, and a ticking time bomb as the ball. Players run plays, in the usual configurations familiar to American football games (pass plays, run plays, and options plays), in order to progress downfield and score touchdowns. Instead of downs and conversions in the usual sense, each time a team runs a play without passing the yardage necessary to achieve a first down, the ball gets hotter, eventually becoming critical. If the team with a critical ball fails to score or achieve a first down, the ball explodes, and any robot player holding the ball at the time is destroyed as well. The game does not feature field goals.\n\nCyberball 2072 can be played either competitively or co-operatively. Each play, the offensive player plays the quarterback, and if a human player is playing on the same team, that player selects which robot they will control for that play. The defensive player(s) likewise select which robots they will control for the play, and each defensive robot player can activate a burst of speed once during the play. When a robot player is \"tackled\" -- knocked down -- it is damaged, and after a certain number of hits on previous plays, once it is hit again in a future play, it will be destroyed and fumble the ball, allowing either team to grab the ball and continue.\n\nThe game is played in six periods, and, as a team scores and/or blocks the opposing team from scoring, the team earns money which can be used to upgrade its robot players. Upgrades proceed from plastic to various tiers of metallic robots, with titanium being the highest, each of which is faster and more durable than the last. Robot players that take hits to the point of damage can be replaced before they get destroyed and fumble the ball in-play.\n\nThe arcade versions of Cyberball 2072 were released either in two-player cabinets with one screen, or in four-player cabinets with two screens.

Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses.

The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.\n\nAs in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning.

In a race around the globe, you and an opponent travel back and forth between 206 cities in 175 countries in search for clues to the treasures’ whereabouts. Cities are connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background info – e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture. \n \nLearning to place countries and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features of the target country and town which help narrow down your options – e.g. “It’s an island country”, “It’s in East Asia” etc. The first player to visit the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base for a points reward. \n \nFor each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400 possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe trotters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jgw0vqv3gzh3lzlwtxtp.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14352,"name":"Build It!: Das Bauhaus","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4sr4.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":14349,"name":"Brigade Commander","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Brigade is a real-time wargame pitting the player against a computer opponent.

Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/er9emeygsiaqyas8pwxj.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":13407,"name":"Blazing Thunder","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ya02bkhxep3hdwukmqzs.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13354,"name":"Avalanche: The Struggle for Italy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"1991, the year Avalanche: The Struggle for Italy was released on Amstrad CPC.

After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.\n\nDuring the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film \"Capricorn One\"). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.\n\nThe Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting people’s homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it's doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these \"black hat\" activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain \"Mr. Garcia\" (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/figk1uwjdgeffl4kiiio.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":12572,"name":"Devious Designs","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Devious Designs, players take on the role of a secret agent tasked with restoring objects and monuments affected by a cube-transforming weapon.

Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the \"room\" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.\n\nAs you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.\n\nThanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly.

It was inspired by an early 1980s game called Hustle from the Radio Shack TRS-80 micro-computer. (It was not influenced by Mozaik Software's 1984 Amstrad CPC game, Nibbler, despite the similar names.) Nibbles was written in QBasic by Rick Raddatz, who later went on to create small business companies such as Xiosoft and Bizpad.\n\nThe game's objective is to navigate a virtual snake (or worm) through a walled-space while consuming numbers (from 1 through 9) along the way. The player must avoid colliding with walls, other snakes or their own snake. Since the length of the snake increases with each number consumed, the game increases in difficulty over time. After the last number has been eaten, the player progresses to the next level, with more complex obstacles and increased speed. There is a multiplayer mode which allows a second player to control a second snake by using a different set of keys on the same keyboard.\n\nNibbles originally became popular because it was included with MS-DOS version 5.0 and above. Written in QBasic, it is one of the programs included as a demonstration of that programming language. The QBasic game uses the standard 80x25 text screen to emulate an 80x50 grid by making clever use of foreground and background colors, and the ANSI characters for full blocks and half-height blocks. Microsoft's 24kB QBasic version was copyrighted in 1990. Because of MS-DOS's prevalence at that time, it was available on almost every PC in the early 1990s. Modern computer speeds have rendered the game-speed-delay timing loops invalid, and thus the QBasic version of Nibbles requires some code changes to operate correctly on modern PCs. However, the adjustable clock rate on the DOSBox DOS emulator allows the original code to run at speeds similar to those on the original hardware. Nibbles is also runnable on QB64 as a way to avoid emulation.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bjbthx3xqtctmtcbsuuj.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":11690,"name":"Qbasic Gorillas","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Gorillas is a video game first distributed with MS-DOS 5 and published in 1991 by IBM corporation.

If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time.
