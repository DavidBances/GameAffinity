Soon the two girls join forces with a princess in exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its allies.\n\nThough Basted may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that alternates between towns and dungeons, etc.), it is in fact primarily an action game. Controlling Ryeza and Anita, the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.\n\nMost battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.\n\nThe game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5249.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":63929,"name":"Startling Odyssey II: Maryuu Sensou","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The second entry in the Startling Odyssey JRPG series","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mjv.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Turbografx-16/PC Engine CD"}]},{"id":48664,"name":"Super Rugby","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Super Rugby is a Sports game, developed by Zap and published by TSS, which was released in Japan in 1989.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3g9r.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":44459,"name":"Funaki Masakatsu Hybrid Wrestler: Tougi Denshou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sport of wrestling mixed with real life simulation!

On August 24, 2009 (in honor of the 46th birthday of the game designer, Hideo Kojima), an unofficial English translation patch was released onto the internet.\n\nThe game is set in a primarily first person perspective and uses a point-and-click interface: the player can move the cursor and have the protagonist (Jonathan Ingram) analyze objects around his environment or talk to other characters in the game. Like in Snatcher, the game features shooting segments where the player must defend their character from incoming enemies. The player can use the shooting trainer at the police department to test their reflex and accuracy. There are numerous puzzles in the game, including an event where the player must dismantle a bomb by following their partner's instructions.\n\nThe console versions of the game all include support for their respective mouse peripherals. The Saturn version features light gun support for the shooting segments.\n\nThe game was notable for being an early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a theme revolving around space exploration and occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to Snatcher, but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. Policenauts also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player's memory of the plot upon reloading a save, an element Kojima would later use in Metal Gear Solid. The PlayStation version of Policenauts could also read the memory card and give some easter egg dialogues if a save file of Konami's dating sim Tokimeki Memorial is present, a technique Kojima would also later use in Metal Gear Solid.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co720g.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"3DO Interactive Multiplayer"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":274177,"name":"Galaxia","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Galaxia is a PWAD created by Pavel Hodek.

Furthermore, it has a stunning amount of levels on varying themes, more of which could be created with the level editor (available to registered users). \n \nThe different levels of GF2 are split up into themes such as Grass Worlds, Lego Worlds, Slime Worlds and Boring Worlds. Each player starts out on his home base with a fully loaded ship. The objective is simply to destroy the player by any means possible, be they to simply shoot him down, bomb him or to ram him into a wall, thereby depleting his shields. If your shields, fuel or ammunition is running low, you must return to your (or even you opponent's) base to refuel. However, landing makes you vulnerable to enemy bombardments. \n \nApart from the plain dogfighting levels, GF2 also offers a large amount of race levels, where the players race around a maze-like level where they must pass check points. Flying your ship around these levels is not as easy as it may seem, since you must fight gravity, just as in Thrust, but unlike Asteroids. \n \nGF2 was part, if not the progenitor, of the cave-flying trend that hit the Amiga in the mid-nineties, alongside games such as Bratwurst or Turboraketti.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ocso3mobuj3tkyswva9v.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":20009,"name":"Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The DarkStalkers have been unleashed!

Rapid Hero is a very classic and relatively efficient shmup . At the command of a hunter who also thinks somewhat of the design of Strike Gunner STG , you will have to repel the enemy bursts avoiding of course to make you touch ... Two heroes are willing to carry out this mission, with a few minor differences in gameplay: the first aircraft is specialized in concentrated direct fire, the second in the deployed shot. Of course, the game offers you its selection of power-ups and special weapons, such as auxiliary and self-guided lasers. The course of the game is rather neat with a certain sense of staging. The big enemies arrive from afar and see their shadow emerge under a heap of clouds before presenting themselves to you is still very pleasant, as are the enemies coming out of destroyed buildings. Stage 3 is an infiltration into an enemy armada: you will see the long enemy ship scrolling from the beginning of the level, before finding it later in the level, armed and ready to fight ... In short, it is very classic As a plot, but some care has been taken in the script, which does not spoil anything. With this in mind, the boss is a small robot that returns to the end of each level with new attacks, which will put your speed to dodge and your sense of positioning to the test. Let's play the game from a more down-to-earth point of view. The graphics without being catastrophic, is not brilliant for all that; This type of visual is not without evoking the consoles 16 bits, which count among their ranks many shmups more pleasant to look. The animation is without great problem, except for a few flashes of sprites, just noted for information because they are finally quite minor. What makes the Rapid Hero's charm is actually how it forces the player to anticipate. The enemy's salvos are fast in devils and admirable in symmetry. Of course, we can predict their move to the screen, but having to deal with 5, 6 or even 7 types of enemy movements sprinkled with a few pellets requires precision in the maneuvers, and it is finally this gameplay that ensures its interest in Rapid Hero . And in case you've made a mistake, there's always the smart bomb to get you out of it ... To conclude, Rapid Hero is an honest and entertaining shmup that will hook the player without being a masterpiece of its kind. Its precise gameplay will delight fans of old school shmups who will find there the sensations of Super Nintendo and Megadrive.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co66oq.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39711,"name":"Metal Saver","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ozj.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39284,"name":"Joe & Mac Returns","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"For this sequel to the sideways scrolling 1991 beat-em-up, \"Caveman Ninja\", Data East chose to eschew the former's gameplay and create a single-screen platformer with gameplay hugely similar to Toaplan's, \"Snow Bros.\", released in 1990.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kyogbb4idmcgufc4qebe.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39037,"name":"Amiga CD Football","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Amiga CD32 Sports: Football. you decide whether you have complete control of the game. coach from the sidelines. or just sit back and watch the action.\n\nYour Amiga CD32 Sports: Football broadcast team. led by Stan Gruel at the anchor desk. will cover the game.\n\nWith video reports from Roland “Freight Train” Reed and Terri Ellis during the pregame, halt-time and post game shows. you will always know more about the game than just the score.

During a career as a coach you're not tied to one club / national team, meaning if you're good enough one (or more) big clubs make offers to you to coach their team.\n\nAll teams featured in this game have real players (names, strengths, weaknesses, etc.) from the 1994/1995 season. The management part of the game allows you to buy any of these players (which number 24,000 in total) if you have enough money and a free slot in your team. Besides the player manger career, you may play friendly matches, single season of any competition, and custom competitions, which can be made from scratch or based on a real one. Teams participating in these competitions can be chosen from any country. All the teams may be played by human player or computer.\n\nThe DOS version is based on Amiga version 1.1 with the data of season 1995/1996. 1.1 adds the ability to switch between player-manager and manager-only status before each match of a career and improved on-pitch skills enhanced for the player teams. Also the athletes' statistics improve by consistent goal-scoring.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3pm7.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":8104,"name":"The Pirates of Dark Water","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The watery world of Mer is threatened by the deadly Dark Water.
