The music is upbeat and catchy, with chiptune-style melodies that will keep players engaged and motivated as they progress through the levels.\n\nGaleão's abilities are relatively simple, but players will need to master them to make it through the levels unscathed. He can jump to avoid obstacles and he can also turn into a Tornado when jumping to attack enemies. Players will need to time their attacks carefully to take down enemies without getting hit themselves.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Galeão's Dreams is to defeat Galeão's evil brother, Peter, and his henchmen, Galebot, the Slippers, and TokTok. Peter's motivation for attacking DreamsLand is simple: he wants to take over the world and plunge it into darkness. Galeão is the only one who can stop him, and he'll need to use all his skills and abilities to save the day.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6g7d.jpg","releaseYear":2023,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"RGS Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":248365,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: The Shadow's Fall","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Legend of Zelda: The Shadow’s Fall is a short 2-4 hour long hack that was made over the course of 18 hours as part of a casual challenge between Letterbomb, Zarby89, Scawful, and Jared_Brian_.

Your unlikely protagonist, a member of the weak Ruby tribe, turned out to be one of a few survivors of the last cataclysm, a giant avalanche. Your initial personal mission quickly turns into the ultimate search for truth - a search that requires you to climb the fabled grand summit.\n\nYour journey begins when you wake up in a mysterious cave. Struck by the blow of a giant avalanche you and your fellow miners have been washed away into the darkness. You must climb out of this crevasse and head to Pinetown - the once great village at the very foot of the Mountain. There might be your only chance to gather the strength, the gear and the knowledge to begin your ascent of the unknown.
