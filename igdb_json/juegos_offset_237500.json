There simply were no people there. There seemed to be no Hellspawn, either. Once the area was secured, attention was turned to the mines. Half of the platoon went in to investigate and you were ordered with the other half to keep the area secure.\n\nAbout thirty minutes later, the telemetry from the team in the mines was blocked by an energy surge, and suddenly, you and your buddies were surrounded by Hellspawn. They literally came out of nowhere, biting and snarling, and no matter how many you and the others blasted, more seemed to fill the gaps.\n\nWhen ammo was running low, you and the other marines took cover. Somehow, you got separated from the others, and when all was quiet, you came out to see what had happened.
