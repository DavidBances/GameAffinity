At that time, a new squad called Shinsengumi was formed on the orders of the Military Commissioner Matsudaira Katamori to maintain peace and order. Only women known as \"shouki\", who can harness power of mystical stones known as \"kishouseki\", were eligible to become its members.\n\nOkita Soujirou was working as an instructor at the Shieikan dojo in western Edo.
