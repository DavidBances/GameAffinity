All it takes is a strategic mind and the will to command. Dive into our game now on Steam and lead your troops to glory!\n\nDive into 6 detailed campaigns each representing a pivotal phase of the Napoleonic Wars — from Preussisch-Eylau in 1807 to the battles of 1814. Each campaign offers a series of battles that shaped the course of history, bringing over 150 missions to your screen.\n\nEach mission showcases a historical battlefield with meticulously positioned army regiments, bringing military history battle maps directly to your screen. Historical accuracy meets tactical gameplay here, where the positioning and terrain play as much a role as your regiments and decisions.\n\nWe've meticulously recreated the authentic design of Napoleonic Wars-era army regiments, complete with historically accurate uniforms and capabilities. It's not just about classifying units as infantry, cavalry, or artillery; it’s about the unique history of each specific regiment, which can significantly impact their role on the battlefield.\n\nTo provide full immersion of battlefield command, we’ve combined turn-based elements like hexagonal grid movement with the simultaneous actions characteristic of RTS. This results in gameplay with a more deliberate pace, where quick reflexes aren’t essential—only a keen strategic mind.\n\nLeverage historical formations like squares, columns, or skirmish lines to gain tactical advantages on the battlefield. Transform your units dynamically to suit the unfolding tactical scenario. With a system designed to minimize randomness, predict the outcome of your strategies and attacks with high accuracy, similar to traditional tabletop wargaming.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8v52.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Revvy Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":317969,"name":"The Vanishing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Vanishing is first person horror game.
