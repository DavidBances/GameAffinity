The game is notable for engaging the player in brinkmanship.\n\nThe goal of the game is simple: the player may choose to be either the President of the United States or the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and must lead the chosen superpower for eight years, seeking to maximize \"prestige\" and avoiding a nuclear war. Each turn is one year long; at the beginning of each year, the player is presented with a set of incidents and crises in various countries around the globe, and must choose a response to each one. Responses may range from no action, to diplomatic notes to the other superpower, to military maneuvers. Each response is then met with a counter-response, which may vary from backing down to escalation. The player then gets a chance to initiate actions, and deal with the opponent's responses.\n\nThis core mechanic is similar to that of Bruce Ketchledge's 1983 game Geopolitique 1990, published by SSI. One difference from the earlier game is how negotiations are resolved. In both games, backing down in a negotiation results in a loss of prestige, which will reverberate politically. Likewise, in both games brinkmanship may result in a global war. In Geopolitique, such wars were actually fought in-game, after which the game continued. In Balance of Power, such a war ends the game instantly, with the following message: \"You have ignited a nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air.

The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.\n\nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.\n\nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost.\n\nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt. A later version of the game was released which eliminated the contest levels and stars.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6oy0.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":12867,"name":"Toobin'","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Toobin' involves Biff and Jet racing their way down the rapids of a river, riding on tires.

Sherlock is based on the legendary fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is Infocom's thirty-first game and is the first of two Infocom games developed by Challenge, Inc. using Infocom's development tools.\n\nThe year is 1887, and all of England is gearing up for the celebration of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, marking her 50th year as monarch. London, naturally, is especially frenzied. Reading the paper one morning, Sherlock Holmes seizes upon one seemingly unimportant notice: the Tower of London has been closed for \"reasons of security.\" The great detective is unsurprised when, moments later, he is asked to investigate the theft of the Crown Jewels. The clues left behind, however, positively reek of a carefully laid trap; Sherlock decides that he must step aside and allow Dr. Watson to pursue the thief instead. But if the Jewels are not replaced within 48 hours, the British government will be forced to admit that their most prized possessions were stolen and suffer worldwide humiliation.\n\nThe player fills the role of Watson, travelling around London in Hansom cabs while attempting to recover the Crown Jewels while encountering many characters from Doyle's stories such as Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft Holmes, and Wiggins of the Baker Street Irregulars.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5w31.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":12602,"name":"Goldrunner II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A vertical scrolling shoot'em up and the sequel to Goldrunner.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9en9.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":12599,"name":"Gold of the Realm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fggvkavtlkxmh2uqv71h.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":12591,"name":"Fright Night","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Based on the 1985 movie of the same name.

There also bounce domes, off of which the ball will be deflected, but over which players are free to move.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yxj.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":8946,"name":"Anticipation","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Anticipation was marketed as Nintendo's \"first video board game\", and was developed by Rare for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988.

After his resurrection by the Terror Mask, Rick makes his way through the mansion, fighting off hordes of creatures in a vain attempt to save his girlfriend Jennifer from a grisly fate. Players of this game will also recognize a number of western horror film influences, such as Friday the 13th and Evil Dead 2.\n\nSimilar to many sidescrolling beat 'em up games, Rick can only move in a two-dimensional environment. The playing field does not feature a three-dimensional area, a feature that was added later in the series with Splatterhouse 3. He has the ability to jump and can punch and kick. Rick also has a Special Attack, where he will perform a drop kick that sends him skidding along the ground, damaging any enemies he hits. Rick can also perform a low kick, low punch, and jumping attacks, as well as pick up and use various weapons placed in the levels.\n\nAll of the levels consist of walking left to right, with occasional auto-scrolling segments. However, alternative pathways through sections of the house are possible by falling down through holes or jumping up onto ladders. In this way, branching gameplay is possible, if only prevalent in the middle levels. Levels culminate in boss fights that take place in a single room. Unlike traditional side-scrolling fighters, boss fights have varying objectives and styles. Unlike most arcade games in the genre, Splatterhouse sends players back to checkpoints after losing lives or reaching game over, discouraging \"credit feeding\" as a method of overcoming the various challenges.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2sun.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"}]},{"id":6790,"name":"Double Dragon II: The Revenge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The original arcade version of \"Double Dragon II\" is essentially an improved version of the first game.

Pressing the attack button of the player's current direction will do a standard series of punches, while pressing the opposite attack button will perform a back kick. A few new moves are added as well, including a Hurricane Kick.\n\nLike in the original game, the arcade version of Double Dragon II is divided into four missions: a heliport, a lumber storehouse, a wheat field, and the new hideout of the boss. Each stage has its own boss character with his own theme. After defeating Willy (the final boss from the original game) in the fourth stage, the player will confront a double of their own character for the game's final battle. If two players reach the end together, then both will each to have to face their own clone for the final battle.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gso.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":6013,"name":"RoboCop","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the game, a player controls RoboCop who advances through various stages that are taken from the 1987 movie.
