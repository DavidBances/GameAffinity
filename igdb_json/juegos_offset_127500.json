The ten mission campaign takes place around three major engagements: Operation Market Garden, the battle of the Bulge, and the battle for the bridge at Remagen.\n\nThe game uses the LithTech Jupiter engine and the same basic mechanics of the Marine Sniper games, although the emphasis is more on action and less on stealth. There are a few rail style vehicle missions and the player usually operates without an A.I. sidekick (although some missions include protecting and providing cover fire for friendly soldiers). Most of the time, the weapon of choice for eliminating enemies is the Springfield M1903 Sniper Rifle, but there are a few additional choices available for when things get hairy including Thompson submachine guns, grenades and bazookas.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5djy.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CITY interactive Sp. z o.o.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Jarhead Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"1C Company","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Groove Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":138091,"name":"High School Musical 3: Senior Year","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7vp4.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":138092,"name":"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3vsp.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":138094,"name":"Pro Mahjong Kiwame","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4cj0.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Athena","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":138095,"name":"Nintama Rantarou GB","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5bce.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Culture Brain","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"}]},{"id":138096,"name":"Gundemonium Collection","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":138097,"name":"The Stone of Madness","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"From the studio that brought you the Blasphemous series comes The Stone of Madness: a real-time tactical stealth game set in an 18th-century Spanish Monastery.

Platforming: Carrying the essence of the puzzles, the player sometimes should get pass the obstacles by platforming, climbing, and jumping different surfaces and heights. As we have mentioned, God is also playable in Naser: Son of Man. The players can summon God to punch, flick, or even middle finger enemies with a giant hand coming out of the sky! The conflicts in Naser: Son of Man are very intense; therefore, the players should use all they have got to defeat the robots.

Not to be confused with the other cancelled adaptation in 2000, nor the released movie tie-in in 2005.\n\nA game based on the original animated series was announced on April 9, 1996 for the PlayStation. The game, which was loosely based on \"The Demiurge\" episode, was being developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Viacom New Media. The game first made an appearance at E3 that same year, with Æon Flux creator Peter Chung on hand to promote it, and commercial advertising was even included in the 1996 VHS release of the animated series.\n\nViacom was dissolved when Spelling Entertainment realized it had two video game divisions. Spelling folded Viacom into Virgin in 1997, which then canceled all working and planned Viacom titles – Aeon Flux being one of them.\nMeanwhile, Cryo reworked the game into a title called PAX Corps, which was released in Europe to poor reviews. No US publisher has signed on to bring the game here.\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact the GT Interactive has acquired the rights to the Aeon Flux license, though no game has been announced to date.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8bqd.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cryo Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]}]
