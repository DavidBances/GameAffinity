World in Conflict contains three factions: the United States, Soviet Union, and NATO. While players may only play as US and NATO forces during the single-player campaign, all three factions can be used in multiplayer games. \n \nDuring a game, players are given a pre-determined amount of reinforcement points, with which to purchase units with varying costs. Once the player deploys the units they purchase, they must wait 20 seconds for them to be airdropped to the field. If a unit is destroyed, the points are refunded to the player in order to allow them to bring in more units. During the single-player campaign, most missions vary what units the player can recruit, while some missions will offer the opportunity to recruit free units, though these cannot be replaced if destroyed. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, such as mobile anti-air guns being most effective against enemy helicopters, and repair tanks being most effective at keeping vehicles and armor repaired. Each unit possesses a defensive ability, such as deploying smokescreens, while some units possess an offensive ability, such as marking targets for bombardment or using grenade launchers on enemy infantry. Once a unit's special ability(ies) has been spent, players must wait for them to recharge before they can be used again. \n \nIn addition to controlling units, players may also call in tactical aid by spending tactical aid points. Points are primarily earned from destroying enemy units in battle. Tactical Aids allow the player to call in anything, from airstrikes on enemy positions, the deployment of paratroopers, to launching carpet bombing raids and tactical nuclear strikes. Tactical aids can allow up to three deployments, after which the player must wait until the support has recharged. In the single-player campaign, players are restricted by what tactical aid they can use, which can change during a mission. \n \nThe game interface for World in Conflict has no framing in the game. A list of units occupies the bottom center, whereas the top right hand corner contains the expandable reinforcement procurement list. The mini map is in the bottom left hand corner, while the bottom right hand corner contains the special abilities buttons (including unit formation). Players can also use a messaging system that is designed to allow conversation between individuals regardless of whether they are on the same server or playing the same game. World in Conflict features a fully rotational 360 degree camera.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1t4v.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sierra Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Massive Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":22885,"name":"Resistance: Retribution","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Set in the weeks after Resistance: Fall of Man, Resistance: Retribution follows the story of former British Marine James Grayson.

This installment still features the same storyline based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, with the various officers as playable characters. The character list and appearance is the same as in Dynasty Warriors 6, meaning some of the previous game's characters are not available.\n\nThe difference in this one is that the player is allowed to choose only one character for the chosen force (either Wei, Wu or Shu) who starts in a village that will act as the hub, or camp, from which the game battles are accessed. By completing story missions, some characters are added and can be played as without starting a new game, meaning all acquired weapons, items and materials will be kept.\n\nThe chosen character can be customized in various ways. Apart from the main weapon, one sub weapon, chosen from many weapon types, can be equipped. Both weapons can be switched anytime during battle, to accommodate the situation. A new addition is the Chi system which allows to set special abilities to the character, there are four slots to equip Chi (the two arms and legs). Weapons can also be customized by adding Orbs that give different abilities, such as elemental properties.\n\nIn the village, the player can exchange materials, buy weaponry, items for use in battle, Chi skills and Orbs. Some NPC's may appear in the village, some giving materials or items, or Officer cards, which can be set to help the Village's growth. Over time, better items can be acquired from the shops.\n\nBy talking to the quest board or the Guard at the village's gate, main Missions or Requests can be chosen. Each battle is a series of small maps where various enemy soldiers and weaponry are fought, eventually leading to the commander of the enemy army. The goal of each battle can vary, some are classic goals like \"Defeat the Commander\" and some, less battle oriented, like \"Retrieve all treasure boxes\". In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion.\n\nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage.\n\nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them. Multiplayer mode is available only via AdHoc connection, and can connect up to four players.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co60k0.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Koei Tecmo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Omega Force","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Koei","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":2061,"name":"Yakuza 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Yakuza 3 is the third chapter in the Yakuza series, renowned for its authentic, gritty, and often violent look at modern Japan.

Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley.\n\nThe game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]\n\nThe cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4yqa.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Vicious Cycle Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"D3 Publisher","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":221321,"name":"Kiniro no Corda 2 f","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kiniro no Corda 2 f is the PSP port of Kiniro no Corda 2.

The mining station is in the orbit of Var Hastra, a planet in a star system he has never heard of. Soon, he learns that he has missed quite a lot... not only has a new faction, the freethinking Mido Confederation founded by Nivellian and Terran runaways and rebels, emerged in the meantime, but also has a new threat started to wreak havoc among all inhabitants of the universe. Coming out of nowhere and launching devastating raids on convoys and freight ships of all factions, the mysterious Voids are about to make the whole galaxy tremble with fear and put the unstable peace among the different alien races to the test. With the help of the clandestine Deep Science society, an equally secretive and progressive union of ingenious scientists led by the beautiful Dr. Carla Paolini, Keith turns against the seemingly unstoppable alien menace and ultimately sets out to face the Voids in their own home world and end their reign of terror once and for all. During this advanture Keith meets his other old comrades, and also has the potential to have his own space station, in the orbit of Planet Kaamo.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8vok.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"bitComposer Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"PLAION","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fishlabs","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fishlabs","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":280847,"name":"Run Elephant Run","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Just keep going.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7jdf.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Armor Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"jmtb02","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":128382,"name":"Touhou Pocket Wars","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Touhou Pocket Wars is fan-made Touhou Project strategic RPG based around Gacha Figurines.
