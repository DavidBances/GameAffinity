Use your swords to fight the enemies: press on X to attack (Sword) and on C to carry out a super attack (Fire Sword). You can advance using the arrow keys. Each fight or obstacle will cost you a sword. Beware, as they are quickly used up. To save your swords, return walk mode by pressing on Z. Again, beware, if you come across an enemy without a sword, you'll lose two lives from a red monster, one life from a normal enemy. It is therefore up to you to manage your swords and avoid the enemies. One lum will win you one life. Watch out for the black hole which warrants a return penalty.

Over the course of the story, he meets and bounds with nine eligible bachelorettes from his school, and can eventually chose to romance one of them.\n\nMuch like its predecessors, the gameplay centers around Oriya exploring his school, his local neighborhood, and the city, during which he can enter restaurants, shops, cafés, houses, etc. and potentially encounter the nine dateable girls and learn more about them through having conversations with them. The nature of these conversations usually depends on which location the girl is found at in and tends to feature multiple answers; in most cases these answers will either advance or hinder the progression of the relationship with the girl in question depending on the player's choices, leading to new story events. The game also features an internal clock and calendar, with some events, such as holiday celebrations or birthdays, only happening at certain times or on certain dates.\n\nThese two systems often times interact, with information given through conversations becoming relevant later down the line - most prominently, the girl in question can give a hint to their tastes in gifts, and if the player later gives them their desired item on their birthdays, it will greatly increase their approval of you.\n\nAlso like its predecessors, the game features scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.\n\n[From MobyGames]","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9d4d.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Elf Co.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":330549,"name":"Deltarune Wandering Makers: Pantheon of the Discarded","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Taking off from the original storyline, you explore a strange new \"darker-than-dark\" world, looking for \"shadow bosses\" to battle for their \"Shadow Crystals\"","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9d2n.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":330550,"name":"Sonic Roller 1 & 2 Deluxe","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"MaxSonic Productions","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":330551,"name":"Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble - Crewmate","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Emergency meeting!
