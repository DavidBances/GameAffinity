Though never released in Western markets, it was a popular import to these regions, leading to the development of the Westernized spiritual sequel Elite Beat Agents, as well as a direct Japanese sequel Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae!

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\n\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup.

As the tyrannical god Zaramoth struck the final blow through Azunai’s trembling shield, the earth shook. In that moment, the forces of magic were unchained, and both armies were consumed in a brilliant cataclysm that stretched for leagues across the Plain of Tears.

But the tide of magic has begun to wane, heeding instead the call of an ancient legacy. From the Plain of Tears a new heir beckons, and with each day his strength grows.

The tasks you can get are mostly kill or fetch quests typical for many ARPGs and MMORPGs that can provide you with valuable items in case you succeed and also do it before a deadline, as all of them are time-limited.\n\nTo add interest and replayability there is a randomly generated loot system, such as also in many more RPGs. The items you get come with different stats, that could improve your character's primary abilities, like strength or agility, add damage or raise the defenses and magical resistance. The rarer the item the more modifiers and higher they are, but also such items require certain character level to wield them.\n\nThe role playing system consists of a set of primary stats, usable skills and passive talents specific for each of the five character classes. Skills could be equipped and used on the game map: there are things like empowered attacks as rain of arrows, or something more original when for limited amount of time you could transform into an a giant spider that will let you bruteforce your way around.\n\nThe visual style is somewhat cartoonish in appearance as in another Blizzard game - Warcraft III.Besides the single player mode, it's possible to play together with up to four player characters on the same in-game locations. And at the same time on the arena you can challenge them to a fight.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jtlqbv57sobwez7pffh9.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cenega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"N-Gage"}]},{"id":43393,"name":"Doomsday Racers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Doomsday Racers is a Racing game, published by Phoenix Games, which was released in Europe in 2005.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ewbepxvr59t9affyxird.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":3928,"name":"Geist","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Take Possession!

Being that way, the first thing he started doing after leaving the facility with his sister - Chidori - was to find and make friends. \n \nBenio Azusa, a tomboyish girl who lived nearby. \n \nHondou Sayaka, a quiet yet sharp-tongued girl who was in charge of raising the pets at school just like him. \n \nTsukamoto Youko and Itsuki, a pair of siblings who belong to a prestigious family around the area. \n \nHiguchi Shouji, a boy he knew by being attracted to by the similarities they both share. \n \nIzuki Fueko, a girl he met by chance. \n \nTogether with Shinobu, they were a group of seven. Just like that, each and every one of them, who had never experienced the joy of having friends, was able to meet each other and become companions. The story begins in a quiet town colored by dusk. Around the seven friends, there were understanding, empathy, conflict, and what's more, fleeting love of adolescence. It was a friendship that could last forever. \n \nSuch a simple happiness should have... lasted forever. \n \nThat was until the \"enemy\" appeared. \n \nThe \"enemy\" had disturbed the peaceful relationship of the seven people. \nShinobu could not forgive that.

And when he realized all that, the world they reside in changed, rather then becoming the new world that it should have... they had arrived at the \"sanctuary\" instead. \n \nThis is a story that describes the heart. \n \nA story that describes the thing located in the farthest end of a heart.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mox.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Xuse","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Regista","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":42602,"name":"Dr. Mario World House Calls","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dr. Mario World House Calls is a rom hack of Super Mario World.

Yinglong descended upon the Earth, and his body parts turned into powerful weapons and artifacts - his claw became a sword, his eye a pearl, and his heart took the shape of a seal.

It is the time of Eastern Han dynasty, the end of one of the several golden epochs of the Chinese civilization. Two gods, Yunkong and Daotian, are playing chess with each other to decide the fate of China.

Players can roll and dash around the environment as well as execute maneuvers such as hairpin turns, immediate stops and precision rolling with effortless strokes of the stylus. In his quest to save Pac-Land, Pac-Man will venture through stages such as Castle Pac, Gyro-Jungle and the Ghost House, while facing perilous hazards like moving floors, dash panels, jump zones and wind zones. Along the way, Pac-Man will find power-ups like the Winged Chocolate, allowing him to fly through the worlds and jump over Ghosts, or the \"Knight Chocolate,\" providing him with armor which grants him the power to crash through walls and withstand more damage. Pac'N Roll also includes the original Pac-Man arcade game, allowing up to two players to munch on pellets and claim the highest score.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co85i2.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":5107,"name":"Fatal Frame III: The Tormented","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rei Kurosawa suffers a strange dream each night, since she took a photo of her dead boyfriend in an abandoned old mansion.\n\nEvery night the dream will take her deeper and deeper in an old mansion, when she will have to find out what is going on.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ov1.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Take-Two Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":4172,"name":"Shadow Hearts: From the New World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shadow Hearts: From the New World is the third official game in the Shadow Hearts series.\n\nThe game series departs from Europe and centers on the \"New World\", the Americas. It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. The main characters' quest is to investigate mysterious \"windows\" from which vicious monsters pop out.\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes, as well as many other actions throughout the game. A new \"Stock\" system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts - Covenant and enables double attacks.\n\nThe \"Stock\" system works by filling up a character's stock gauge when he/she performs or receives an attack. A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored. Stock can then be utilized in many ways. For example, doing a Double attack (a character performs two action on the same turn) or starting a Combo consumes one Stock. A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock. The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts: Covenant, with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available.\n\nMagic returns in the form of Stellar Charts, where characters equip Stellars onto the chart. The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs. Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar, the strongest non-elemental magic in the game.\n\nFusion is also back in the game, albeit quite differently. Unlike Yuri, Shania does not possess the power of the Harmonixer where she is able to fuse into different demons. She makes spirit pacts with the different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform. Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes; statues of different animals, she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up.\n\nSnapping photos is more emphasized in this game. Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies, he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes. Johnny can also draw upon the power of Malice to transform; though this ability comes rather late in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2hz3.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ghostlight Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"XSEED Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Aruze","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nautilus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":301229,"name":"Need for Speed: Most Wanted Demo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The PlayStation 2 demo disc for Need for Speed: Most Wanted features 3 unique events that are not found in the main game, including a race against Rog, Blacklist rival #16.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co87jb.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EA Canada","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"EA Black Box","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":271371,"name":"Down the Ratbit Hole","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Medium sized medieval library map using Knave textures - made for the SM100 turtlemap event.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co77u3.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":171794,"name":"The Bunker","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Ronin golfer Mike Roman just wants to play golf, but when the evil sorcerer Manlocke miniaturizes him and traps him in the bunker, he must utilize his wits and his golf club in order to escape... ...or he may never be able to play golf again.

It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan.\n\nPlayers start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.\n\nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse.\n\nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.\n\nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.\n\nSee also[edit]","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/rltzqvxvycsvq3kvth1p.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SCE Studio Liverpool","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":5790,"name":"Cricket 2005","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The game was released in three different region-based covers.

where the player takes a task force of three people through six European countries including France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Russia. The team needs to neutralize threads and can choose between six different agencies, such as GSG-9, NOCS, Team Alfa and the SAS. The player can only control one team member at a time, but issue general commands to the other two members such as \"follow\" or \"hold\". At any time, it is possible to directly take control of any of the other team members. This is useful as every agent has access to different weaponry, but the game also encourages the player to place agents in tactical positions to provide cover fire when entering new areas.\n\nMissions consist of securing objectives and taking out the opposition. Weapons, ammo or health do not need to be collected. Each agent has a number of different weapons and can switch between them. These include handguns, shotguns, machine guns and sniper rifles.

The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co51ki.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Take-Two Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":20492,"name":"MS Saga: A New Dawn","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"MS Saga is a console-style role-playing adventure, featuring an original storyline, setting, and characters, along with fan-familiar \"mobile suit\" 'mechs from the G Gundam, Gundam Wing, and Mobile Suit Gundam series.
