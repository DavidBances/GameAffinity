This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.\nVideo Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.\nTutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.\nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song).\n\nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs. As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fhaor0klumb1pzzetorn.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":43314,"name":"Jampack: Volume 14","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This version of JAMPACK VOLUME 14 includes games rated M and is generally for older gamers, although it does includes games rated E and T.

First released for the PlayStation 2 console on March 13, 2007, it is the second installment in the God of War series, the sixth chronologically, and the sequel to 2005's God of War. The game is based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player character is protagonist Kratos, the new God of War who killed the former, Ares. Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods, who strips him of his godhood and kills him. Slowly dragged to the Underworld, he is saved by the Titan Gaia, who instructs him to find the Sisters of Fate, as they can allow him to travel back in time, avert his betrayal, and take revenge on Zeus.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous installment. It focuses on combo-based combat which is achieved through the player's main weapon—Athena's Blades—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require players to quickly complete various game controller actions to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared to its predecessor, God of War II features improved puzzles and four times as many bosses.\n\nGod of War II has been acclaimed as one of the best PlayStation 2 and action games, and was 2007's \"PlayStation Game of the Year\" at the Golden Joystick Awards. In 2009, IGN listed it as the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time, and both IGN and GameSpot consider it the \"swan song\" of the PlayStation 2 era. In 2012, Complex magazine named God of War II the best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It was the best-selling game in the UK during the week of its release and went on to sell 4.24 million copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. God of War II, along with God of War, was remastered and released on November 17, 2009 as part of the God of War Collection for the PlayStation 3. The remastered version was re-released on August 28, 2012 as part of the God of War Saga, also for the PlayStation 3. A novelization of the game was published in February 2013.\n\nThe European/Australian PAL version was released as two different editions: a single-disc standard edition and a two-disc \"Special Edition\" with different box art and a bonus DVD.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2enk.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\".\n\nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs.\n\nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9cqh.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":43462,"name":"Furry Tales","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"After a thousand years of Warfare, the conflict between Sheep and Wolves has entered a new and delirious age : secret and terrifying weapons may soon change the course of the war!\n\nThis full-3D action-RTS is filled with humor and high explosives, as sheep and wolves go at it for the survival and status of their species.

The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments. \n \nThe game does not attempt to understand the singer's words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song. \n \nThe songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the SingStar series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos, where available.
