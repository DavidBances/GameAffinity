Meet PAMELA, an omnipresent AI overseer who is left alone watching over the once-vibrant city, now reduced to a silent monolith gliding across the ocean. She will fight by your side as you struggle against Eden’s tortured Citizens. Uncover the tragic events that lead to the downfall of a civilization, and fight for your life as the broken citizens of Eden defend their home against your intrusion. With a personality-driven AI system, no encounter will be the same as the Afflicted react in unpredictable ways, driven by their excruciating pain and disfiguring disease. \n \nInteract with various Factions, including The Afflicted citizens, security Droids, robotic Custodians, and more mysterious denizens hidden within Eden's depths. Each faction exhibits its own unique behaviors and alliances, and will react dynamically to the player’s behavior to become allies, or enemies. Experience tense gameplay in a richly developed sci-fi universe. Each decision is meaningful, and each encounter could be your last. Wield and customize an array of Modular Equipment to defend yourself and explore the environment. Utilize an immersive UI and full body awareness, where the player's involvement is never broken. \n \nManage the power reserves of the city, using energy only when necessary to avoid the dangers of being stranded in the dark.
