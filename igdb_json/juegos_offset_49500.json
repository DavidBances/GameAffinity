The radiations, low temperatures and the atmosphere without oxygen will kill you. \nThe meteorites can also kill you and/or destroy your base. \n \nThe modular system will let you create something as you like. \nCreate 3D parts by using a 3D printer and start building your base. \n \nThe abandoned rovers from Mars soil will give you parts to build a good rover. You also can create it with 3D printed parts. Or you can combine them and use the remaining parts to other projects. \n \nYour temporary home will be a spacecraft. You also will have few items to survive until you will make a farm, a base and other things that will help you to survive. \nYou can create water in 2 ways: \nBy 'boiling' the soil, and by burning hydrogen and oxygen. \nYou can grow different plants in your base: arabidopsis, mizuna lettuce, super dwarf wheat, apogey wheat, brassica rapa, rice, tulips, kalanchoe, flax, onions, peas, radishes, lettuce, wheat, garlic, cucumbers, parsley, dill, lettuce and cinnamon basil. \n \nYou can mine in different ways, but the simple one is to create a drilling machine and to place it where you want to drill. After it will finish drilling, you can get the 'drilled ore' and melt it to extract the metals. \n \nYou can use portable power banks to store energy from solar panels. If you want to use a PPB (Portable Power Bank) in a rover/vehicle, you can do that to charge it and use it on a vehicle/rover. \nBut, if you want to connect solar panels directly to the base, you can also do that. \n \nYou can sell goods (metals and other things) from Mars to Earth by using a small spacecraft. You will receive some coins and you can use them to buy something from Earth.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":53693,"name":"Survivor Squad Complete","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":53694,"name":"Sushi Frenzy","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":53695,"name":"Swipe Quest","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Swipe Quest is a video game where grid puzzle concept meets random generation of adventures, epic storyline and RPG mechanics.\nSwipe to control your hero in the fantasy world.\nWhen two tiles of the same type touch,\nthey merge into one with higher value!\nFight with monsters, get treasures, be the mighty hero!","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":53696,"name":"Talisman -

Quest for the Golden Banana, like its predecessor, is essentially a collection of mini-games, most of them implementations of well-known casual genre titles. The game is divided in islands, where the main monkey character and his animal friends live. Each island acts as a hub for three mini-games. On the main screen, the player has to buy plants, furniture, toys and other things to decorate the scenery and unlock a series of key items to move to the next island. These decorations are bought with gold coins, acquired after playing one of the mini-games:\n\nCascade is a tile matching game, where the objective is to make matches of three or more of the same type by switching adjacent tiles in a grid filled with food. The food keeps falling after successful matches, to be promptly eaten at the bottom by some animal that acts as a level progress meter, crossing the screen towards a small flag. In the boss battles, the goal is to make matches as fast as possible, to throw food at the enemy before they clog all the cells in the grid;\n\nCoco Bowl is a bowling game with coconuts as the ball. The coco can be guided with the mouse while it is going through the lane. Some levels have special features, like ramps and other obstacles;\n\nStone Stacker is a simple puzzle game, where the player must stack slabs on top of each other by matching their indentations at the top and bottom, creating a tall pillar at the left side of the screen. Special items, like a hammer and a wildcard stone, help to eliminate useless slabs and make matching easier;\n\nIce Cream Parlour is a time management game, where a penguin must serve ice cream to a series of fellow penguin customers. Thought bubbles over the customers heads show pictures of the recipients and ingredients of their order, while stars below them show their satisfaction level. The player must click on several hotspots on the screen, guiding the penguin to pick up the correct recipient, give it to one of the lemur assistants ready to scoop or place one of the ingredients, and finally bring it back to the client before the patience meter runs out. An iguana acts as the trash can, swallowing badly served orders. The goal of each level is to profit a set amount of money within a time limit. A bonus game appears sometimes, where the player must move an ice cream cone at the bottom of the screen and pile up on it several balls scooped and thrown upwards by one of the lemurs;\n\nPirates! is a shooting game. The player controls a cannon placed over a precarious raft in the middle of the sea, and the objective is to shoot any enemy on the screen before it reaches and destroys the raft. The raft can be repaired between levels on a separate underwater screen, where tetrominoes wood pieces have to be placed logically on its frame. Barrels carry new ammunition types, changing the power and range of the shots. A bonus game appears occasionally, where the cannon is used to feed dolphins;\n\nFish Swap is a matching game, where the player has to swap fishes on a grid, creating large schools that escape the screen. A blowfish appears randomly on the grid, and acts as a power-up liberating several fishes at the same time;\n\nWater Words is a word creation game, similar to Bookworm and other titles.
