Until a group of adventurers came to this land, fought against the dragon, and found the power stone that helped them awaken the sleeping goddess from her slumber and save her world.\nDo you remember what happened 13 years ago? Now, the Dragon Valley Continent has been attacked by giant dragons once and the land of happiness is the brink of collapse. Do you hear the goddess' voice calling out to you in your dreams? Adventurers, please come back! Come back and save this world from darkness.\nAltea is waiting for you and your friends to go home and save this world and its youth from being destroyed by these vile creatures.\nAll four classes will provide players with plenty of options when it comes to finding the best approach. Dungeons can be tackled solo or in groups of four or eight players while World Bosses will require coordinated efforts from all players to bring down for precious rewards.","imageUrl":"Sin
