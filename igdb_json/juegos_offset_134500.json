Powered by a massive 5-liter V8 engine and delivering more than 428hp of power and 528 Nm of torque, buyers can choose between a full manual and automatic six-speed gearbox, the latter coming with genuine shifting paddles – a first in the long history of the Mustang.\n\nBased on the Porsche 911 3.2, the 1987 CTR Yellowbird is one of Ruf’s most iconic models that has helped build Ruf's reputation for building no-compromise sports cars. The 3.4 liter twin-turbocharged flat six engine provided 469hp from two large turbo chargers & intercoolers and had been equipped with a new Bosch Motronic as well as an ignition setup originally designed for Porsche’s 962 Group C race car. Thanks to extensive weight-saving measures such as usage of fiberglass and aluminum, the CTR weighs just 1150 kilograms, resulting in a very impressive performance.\n\nBMW's 2002 Turbo road car made the history books in 1973 by becoming Europe's first-ever mass-produced road car powered by a turbocharged engine. The 2002 Turbo's two-liter four cylinder engine provided 170hp of power, a figure that made the 2002 one of the most powerful cars on the road during its time. Unfortunately, the 1974 oil crisis forced an end to the 2002 Turbo's production after just one year as gas prices were soaring across the world. Only 1672 cars were produced during the model's limited production run, making the 2002 Turbo one of BMW's most iconic and most sought-after classics.\nBuilt to the Super 2000 touring car regulations, the 320TC is BMW's weapon of choice for competition in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) and countless national touring car series around the globe.\nWeighing 1170 kilograms, the car is powered by a 1.6 litreDI-turbo four-cylinder engine and a full adjustable six-speed sequential gearbox. Driven by veteran touring car aces such as Tom Coronel, Franz Engstler & Stefano D'Aste, the 320TC clinched five world championship wins.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co834o.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Slightly Mad Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120192,"name":"Project CARS: Japanese Car Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"- 1999 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI TME\n- 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX FQ-360\n- 2012 Toyota GT86 / Toyota 86\n- 2015 Scion FR-S Rocket Bunny Edition\n- 2015 Toyota GT-86 Rocket Bunny GT Edition\n- 2014 Toyota TS040 Hybrid","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co834p.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Slightly Mad Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":120190,"name":"Project CARS: Renault Sport Car Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"2015 Renault Sport R.S. 01\nA purebred racer down to the core, the R.S. 01 is Renault Sport Technology's newest creation for on-track competition.\n\n2015 Formula Renault 3.5\nThe Formula Renault 3.5 Series is a major step on the career ladder of drivers aiming to make it to the highest echelons of open wheel racing.\n\n2014 Renault Mégane R.S. 275 Trophy-R\nThe Mégane R.S. 275 Trophy-R continues Renault’s tradition of class-leading hot hatches, creating a racy track special that proves a lot of racing spirit can hide in hatchback form.\n\n2009 Renault Mégane Trophy V6\nBuilt by Renault Sport Technologies, the Megane Trophy V6 was used in Renault’s long-running Eurocup Megane Trophy racing series all across Europe.\n\n1978 Renault Alpine A442B\nThe 442B is one of Renault’s most successful race cars ever built, helping the French company to its only overall victory at the legendary 24 Heures du Mans.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co834g.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Slightly Mad Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":119968,"name":"Cities: Skylines - Deluxe Edition Upgrade Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Upgrade Cities: Skylines to Deluxe Edition.
