This is an official version of Frostpunk, one of the most popular PC hits in recent history, now made available on smartphones.\n\nIn Frostpunk: Beyond the Ice, a post-apocalyptic scenario awaits, although it's unlike any other: a modern ice age has left your city totally isolated from everything around it. Your city is humanity's last stronghold, and it's your job to help as many people as possible survive while making morally difficult decisions as you fight to get through another day.\n\nGameplay in this survival game is based on constructing buildings, gathering resources, and making tough decisions. Not only do you have to choose which buildings to construct but also how many workers are assigned to each one. As is typical in a strategic management game, you'll have to wait between each construction project or resource harvest until it's done.\n\nDeciding your city's laws, on the other hand, is one of the most interesting and unique aspects of this game. The rules you set might seem extreme compared to today's laws, but this game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, so you'll have to do everything you can to ensure your survival. Both the decision- and law-making processes are practically identical to the original version of the game, which feels like a fresh take for this genre.\n\nFrostpunk: Beyond the Ice is an excellent survival game with a good dose of strategy. To play it well, you'll need to think carefully before making important decisions in this icy world. This game stands out for its infinite possibilities as well as its difficulty. While your city might not survive on your first attempt, you'll get better at living in the deadly world of Frostpunk each time you play.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7oep.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Com2uS","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":199960,"name":"OP: Voyage Chronicles","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hayama Game","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":199961,"name":"Shall we date?: Blood in Roses","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Now included in the \"Dear Otome\" app.\nThe heroine of the game meets a beautiful and bloodcurdling kind, ‘Vampires’ at the castle connecting the dark world and the human world.
