The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) says \"So, what's better about Set Pro HD than either the earlier Set app or a deck of Set cards. Well, pretty much everything.....\". See /.\n\nThe SET game has won over 35 Best Game Awards. SET Pro HD enables you to find SETs at the speed of your brain. Using two hands you have the same speed advantage as you do in typing or playing the piano. The sense of a really fast player is, in fact, that of a piano player (see the YouTube demo -  – boy does this guy have good brain connections!). The SET game is also enjoyed when played with others. In multi-player game play there are no turns in the game. Up to four people can simultaneously play all using both hands. SET Pro HD removes all previous electronic limitations in all of its play modes, making this realization of the SET game a joy to play.\n\nTo find a SET you must recognize three cards on the gameboard of 12 cards in which each of the features, examined independently, are either the same on the 3 cards OR different on the 3 cards. That’s it. One rule. It is deceptively simple. Thus, it’s easy to learn. A 6 year old can do it. But it’s a challenge for life, and mastering it challenges college students and their professors. The game has two levels Basic and Advanced. All players, regardless of age need to learn using the Basic level. Once you get the idea down, move to the Advanced level where you will experience the depth and richness of the mental challenge of SET. The Advanced level is the complete SET game. Of course, since SET is a game for all ages, younger players may take longer to be able to play the full game. Basic level has 3 features that anyone can master. Advanced level has four features, which is a challenge for all.\n\nWhen you want a challenge for just yourself, SET Pro HD includes 6 solitaire game modes, Classical SET, Rediscovery SET, Sprint SET, Marathon SET, Puzzle SET, and Arcade SET. In Classical SET play, SET Pro HD challenges you to get through the deck in the shortest time finding SETs. In Rediscovery SET you try to get 25 SETs in the shortest time, with the cards either being rearranged, or, with 3 cards randomly replaced every 10 seconds if you don’t find a SET. In Sprint SET you are challenged to get the most SETs in 60 or 90 seconds. You never run out of cards. In Marathon SET you must pace yourself to get the best scores. Puzzle SET challenges you to find 4 or 6 SETs in a fixed gameboard of cards. Arcade SET paces you as you play requiring you to find SETs faster and faster until you cry ‘uncle’. In all game modes you can play either Basic or Advanced Level.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, players tap their scorecards to take control of the board, and then tap-in their SET, or, after tapping they can swipe their scorecard (or tap the NO-SET icon) to gain additional points if they perceive that a NO-SET situation exists. A point is lost if 3 cards are selected that don’t make a SET, or if a player doesn’t tap the cards within the time limit.\n\nFor beginners, there is an interactive Tutorial, and Hints are provided in all the game modes. Players can choose to play in teams. Your scores can be kept in the STATS if you choose, and in STATS ALL your best scores and those of all your friends are ranked if players want to see their rankings.\n\nAdditional help and Tutorials are provided on the website","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/atmeifb6fidegdzideaa.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":66641,"name":"Busou Shinki: Battle Masters","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co543k.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":64403,"name":"Momotaro Dentetsu Tag Match: Yuujou, Doryoku, Shouri no Maki!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Momotaro Dentetsu Tag Match: Yuujou, Doryoku, Shouri no Maki! is a video game in the Momotaro Dentetsu series of board game-style video games, genre released in 2010 by Hudson Soft for the PlayStation Portable.

This is how the list of candidates runs: there is a good programmer, an artist a bit scarce and a designer not bad; each of them, thanks to their skills, can give a more or less relevant hand in the realization of the project. Once everything is ready you must finally choose the kind and type of game to be realized, keeping in mind that some combinations will get married much better than others.\nIn Game Dev Story player can choose the platform on which to develop the project, and here things start to get very interesting. Game Dev Story in fact traces the last twenty years of the history of the video game industry, reproposing it in the form of an exhilarating parody: we start from the first computers, and then see almost all the major portable and home consoles announced. The names of companies, games and platforms have been revised, but are entirely traceable back to the originals; the Game Boy becomes the Game Kid and Microsoft is now Microx. However, in addition to the order in which the consoles are launched, the developers have chosen to keep even the success they have had at market level, which, on the one hand makes it even more pleasant to relive these twenty years from the inside , on the other hand, the player can easily predict big business and flop: nobody will be so crazy to develop a game for Virtual Boy (pardòn, Virtual Kid), while immediately supporting the fees of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 could lead to big boxing.\nThere are also annual awards, in which a jury rewards the best games of the year in the various categories. In the course of developing a project, however, the player will never remain with his hands: he will have to instruct his employees in order to cultivate their skills, buy the development kits of the various consoles, send announcements and look for new staff.\nIt is essential to keep the interest of the fans high, create hype and see the players line up days before the game, while sales can increase thanks to good reviews in specialized magazines. And yet, making a sequel to a successful game means starting the odds with good odds that the game sells, while the player can decide whether to invest everything in an ambitious project or make small titles in a very short time, until a budget has been reached. high enough to be able to make and place your console on the market.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4mcq.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kairosoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}]},{"id":7598,"name":"Alien Swarm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Alien Swarm is a game and Source SDK release from a group of talented designers at Valve who were hired from the Mod community.\n\nAvailable free of charge, the game thrusts players into an epic bug hunt featuring a unique blend of co-op play and squad-level tactics.
