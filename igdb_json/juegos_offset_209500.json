Edison Carter is an investigative reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic construct of his mind that was stored after Edison was involved in a motorcycle accident and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a \"Max Headroom\" sign going into a tunnel. Max lives in computers and can appear on any screen, television or any electronic device. The character is actually Matt Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear jittery and stuttering like an early computer model.\n\nIn the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 top floors of their high-rise building starting at the 200th floor. Security systems protect each floor and you have to find and enter the correct codes to gain access from the elevators. Each floor seen in isometric view, has lines representing walls of various rooms with doors and office furniture. Robots will chase and fire at you and decrease your health level as shown on the biomonitor at bottom of screen. Also indicated are the floor number and time left. On the right side of screen are 4 icons for Reporter E. Carter which open a door, call elevator, view through camera, or allow movement to run around the floor. On the left side are icons for Controller T. Jones (Theora helps you hack into systems) to show you the floor and computer circuits.\n\nWhen entering a security code, it takes the form of an LED digit over which you must move a pointer over a row of circuit lines in order to activate various segments to form a desired digit. Each segment will remain lit only temporarily so when time runs out you must ensure that the letter is fully lit or your code will fail. In that event, you must make your way across the floor to the second elevator and try again.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/uwu02rol5bwbcrtfcroq.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":26435,"name":"Sai Combat","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sai Combat features real-life combat, in the Japanese style of Sai Karate AKA Kendo.

Instead, you navigate sites in, around and under Paris, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to solve puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to lose a life at the merest contact.\n\nThe narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along the way in the transition from high literature to action arcade game and back to crypto-literary interactive fiction, but they take what they've learned about design along the way and present things clearly, possessions and companions continually visually indicated above a baroque text input/output field.

The next year they were vended together as the first, second and last of the Silicon Dreams. Early advertisements gave it the title of Silicon Dream, but it was pluralised later.\n\nAs most Level 9 games, the trilogy used an interpreted language termed A-code and was usable in all major types of home computer of the time, on either diskette or cassette. Level 9 self-published each game separately, but the combination was published by Telecomsoft, which sold it in the United States with the tradename Firebird and in Europe with the tradename Rainbird.\n\nThe trilogy is set in a not too-distant future when humans have started colonising space. For the first two instalments the player has the role of Kim Kimberly, an undercover agent, whose goal in Snowball is to save the colonist's spacecraft from crashing into a star, and in Return to Eden to stop the defence system at the destination planet of Eden from destroying the craft. In The Worm in Paradise, the player, with the role of an unnamed citizen of Eden, must travel around the city of Enoch, learn its secrets, earn money and save the planet.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9d9h.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":15364,"name":"Shackled","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Move your player through a maze-like level.

To travel a \"robot hull\" must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground.\n\nThere are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a \"Meanie\" which will ultimately force you to teleport.

The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the \"Witch Queen\". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin. \n \nFollowing the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book. \n \nCauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jyk.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":13456,"name":"By Fair Means or Foul","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ooygqzbeqak9ojrsjbbp.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"}]},{"id":13450,"name":"Bugsy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vwaxa5w2zoygmgidwscd.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":13437,"name":"BreakThru","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"BreakThru is a 2D side-scrolling vehicle shooter.

In your rush to get to the building you have forgotten your equipment like garlic and stakes, which is needed to face Dracula. You have to get to the 12th floor using elevators (which have minds of their own and can take you down as well as up), and you must look behind the doors of each flat for equipment to help you.\n\nSome flats are also empty as well as flats that have scares inside you and when scared, you lose part of a shock meter and when it reaches zero then it is game over. Bats and spiders live on various floors with some blocking your route so bullets can be found in the flats to clear the way. Some doors to the flats actually are lift shafts which send you back down to the 1st floor.

All the animals were docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas, and other races mingled with one another and worked to make Marvel Land into an increasingly beautiful place to live. A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\n\nThe key of time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the key of time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend. Zouna, the Dark Wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the key of time for himself.\n\nFinally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.\n\nThe desperate call has been answered by the heavens. Valkyrie, a fledgling shield maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven. Her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness that has consumed it. Then her adventure begins.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4nyc.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":47558,"name":"Alpha Roid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Alpha Roid is a simple but great combination of a shump and a fighting game.\n\nAfter flying through space you must perform hand-to-hand combat with an equally determined enemy in order to get your weapon upgrades.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co91ph.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":18676,"name":"Thin Ice","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You play Duncan the penguin, who enjoys skating on thin ice-- especially around the other penguins.

Coyote into these traps to put some valuable distance between the Road Runner and his pursuer. Road Runner must also eat the piles of seed that appear at various points throughout the stages, as missing five bird seeds will cause Road Runner to faint and result in the player losing a life.\n\nRoad Runner's colourful, beautifully-drawn graphics capture the spirit and humour of the legendary cartoons perfectly. The music and sound effects are also faithful to the cartoon series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6j0j.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":77228,"name":"Super Mario Bros.

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.\n\nThe player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.\n\nEnemies turn \"angry\" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence).\n\nAfter a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost.\n\nContact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) results in death.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7j5x.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX2"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":202915,"name":"Fantasy Zone","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Master System port of Fantasy Zone differs visually from the original arcade Sega System 16 version, since the hardware is much more limited.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4sp3.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"}]},{"id":48240,"name":"Star Soldier","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A strange and evil presence is lurking in space.

In cities and palaces it is possible to talk to people, rest in inns and buy weapons, armor and items in shops.\n\nWhen wandering around in the wilderness or through dungeons, the player character encounters randomly appearing enemies. Combat is turn-based, with the player selecting menu options while fighting. It is possible to attack with the equipped weapon, cast one of the few available spells (using up some of the magic energy), use an item, or try to run. All the battles in the game are exclusively one-on-one. Killing monsters yields experience, and the player character's attributes improve automatically when he levels up.\n\nWith the exception of the final location, the entire game world is theoretically open for exploration from the beginning. However, the enemies become increasingly tough as the player character attempts to move away from the starting town, effectively limiting him to confined areas determined by his level. The hero has limited hit points, loses them when attacked by enemies, and dies when he runs out of them, at which point he is automatically restored in a nearby town.

The monsters are hiding in the different buildings on the island and to kill them you’ll have to find an appropriate weapon. For example, to kill Dracula, you’ll need a stake and a hammer and to kill the werewolf a gun with some silver bullets might be useful. All the necessary weapons are too scattered among the different buildings, but not necessarily in the same building as the monster it is suitable for. So you’ll have to roam the island searching through the various buildings, looking for the weapons and the monsters to use them on.

Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks.

Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the games timer.
