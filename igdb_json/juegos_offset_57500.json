While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be \"refilled\" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.).

Its gameplay consists of platforming, exploration and weapons-based combat with a main four-button configuration.\n\nPower Factor originally began as a project intended for the Atari ST that was in development by Red Rat Software under the title Red Ace, which was nearly completed before being left unpublished due to internal issues at the company and its eventual disbandment prior to release, however Hand Made Software would later develop a conversion to the Lynx.\n\nPower Factor has been met with positive reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release, who praised various aspects of the title such as the unique storyline, graphics and character animation but many felt divided in regards to the sound design and gameplay.
