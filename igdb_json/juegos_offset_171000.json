The player must protect a cargo ship (white craft) which travels on a lay lines from bounty hunters (red crafts), which will destroy the cargo ship if they cross its way. As the cargo ship moves along the lay lines, the player must place NGR bots (green X symbols) at the lay line intersections to change traffic; the player has 7 NGR bots and can replace them. When any ships reaches an NGR bot, it will turn right if traveling vertically or turn toward the bottom of the screen when traveling horizontally. Red mushroom-shaped power ups, when picked up allow the cargo ship to destroy the bounty hunters; alternatively, bounty hunters can be simply directed to them and will be destroyed. White X marks will send the cargo ship back in the opposite way it was traveling; if hit by a bounty hunter, they will also send them back, but will be destroyed. Lilac squares are mines which will destroy any ship that passes over them. Finally, blue dots will give bounty hunters an extra life if taken by them. The player and the bounty hunters start with 15 lives each, the first to drop to zero loses.\n\n- Programmed Trip is a turn based game which shares many elements from the previous game. As the name implies, the player has to program the trip of the cargo field so it passes over pickup points (colored + symbols) in a specific order: first lilac, then red, then blue. To do so, NGR bots can be placed to redirect the ship, and some fields may also have White X marks already placed. After all desired NGR bots are placed, the player can release the cargo ship by placing the cursor over the upper left corner and pressing the action button. When the cargo ship is released the player has 30 points. Passing over pickup points in the correct order adds 20 points to the score, while passing over them in the wrong order or hitting any other item (NGR bots or white X marks, for instance) subtracts 10 points from the score. The game is over either when the score reaches 0 or when all pickup points were reached in the right order (in which case they'll turn white).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30i8.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Humanoid Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ectron Eletronica","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"}]},{"id":147344,"name":"Penguins!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Visit the most adorable animals in the zoo any time of the day or night!

The show's next season was held back to properly strategize the direction to take. TMNT 2003 had ultimately suffered from weak writing, making use of very involved plots but not comfortably telling the stories needed to be told, and as such the audience left. The decision was made to entirely skip the next season in favor of airing the semi-reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward, sending the brothers into the future and equiping themselves in cybernetic armor. Fast Forward had a distinctly different art style and the tone was much more lighthearted than before, though it failed to make any great impact on either ratings or merchandise due to the paper-thin premise. Only one game was produced to tie in with Fast Forward, Ninja Training NYC.\n\nNinja Training NYC is very much a standard action title for mobile phones, dumbing the concept down to make it suitable for a numberpad controller wihout any complicated controls. In this game, the TMNT must train in two specific categories, Combat and Agility.\n\nIn Combat, the turtle is situated center screen and must take out holographic men in suits wearing towels on their heads by pressing 4 or 6 repeatedly, or 2 in order to jump and attack. Certain enemies will drop special items which can be used to refill energy, and there is also a special meter that fills up; when full, it can be used to launch a shellshocker attack using the 5 key.\n\nIn Agility, the turtle of choice must run left or right to find the correct car which will fall down or find a hole to avoid getting killed off by the downward scrolling screen.

Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.\n\nSince the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them.\n\nA behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5eye.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Epic Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":21467,"name":"A-Train HX","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co99g4.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"505 Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Artdink","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":19159,"name":"Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The world of Terresia is under assault by a \"devourer\", which seeks to consume its mana and leave it barren.
