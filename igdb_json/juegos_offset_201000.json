There are graphics but nothing more than basic icon-on-map bare essentials. That may sound like a bad thing but in reality it's not since Carrier Strike more than makes up for that shortcoming by offering intense and detailed game play. The game is based on a fairly simple premise: have your carriers kick the stuffing out of their carriers. But the rub here is that in order to do that, you've got to find their carriers first. In a decidedly cat-and-mouse fashion, each day that dawns on the high seas of the South Pacific will find you desperately searching through bad weather, rough conditions or simply the enormous body of water to just locate the enemy before any sort of military action can take place. If you're an expert who knows the historically correct Japanese hiding spots, the designer has seen you coming and offers a random enemy placement option to keep you guessing.\n\nWhat makes Carrier Strike a challenging game, though, is the balancing act you'll be required to perform as the area commander over all the actions a carrier is capable of during war. Eventually, once you've found your targets, you'll quickly find yourself hip deep in the dizzying tasks of assigning combat air patrols for defense of your task force, managing weapons load-outs and fueling of various types of aircraft, giving orders for searches or air attacks, monitoring other ships and generally just holding the whole ball of wax together. All of this is accomplished through a turn-based system where each turn equals twenty minutes of real time. This becomes a factor in some operations and can lead to confusion or wasted blocks of time if your coordination skills are lacking. The hardware in Carrier Strike mirrors the actual weaponry, ships and planes that were used in the South Pacific during WWII. Outside influences such as the introduction of better radar and the slow decline of the enemy's pilot efficiency are realistically phased in during the game. Fortunately, the interface is fairly simple and easy to use since you'll need all your time coordinating events.\n\nUltimately, Carrier Strike will appeal to those war gamers who bask in statistics and a realistically based war machine. Those looking for flashy graphics and killer cut scenes won't find them here. Be prepared for a logistical and strategic exercise when in command of your Carrier Strike. Fast thinking and calm nerves will be a plus when faced with operating elevators bringing aircraft up to the deck while under heavy enemy fire and at the same time coordinating their missile and bomb loads, take off and mission orders. Selecting the appropriate aircraft and weapons based on what your search planes find requires precise scheduling and prompt decision making. Carrier Strike offers an accurate, enjoyable simulation of carrier warfare in the South Pacific.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7kla.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":47008,"name":"Clyde's Adventure","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A DOS puzzle-platformer from Moonlite Software.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ya3srh5use0lmia1ghsr.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":46972,"name":"The Great War: 1914-1918","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A turn-based strategy game set in World War I, using a similar engine and gameplay system as Battle Isle.\n\nBoth players act simultaneously on a split screen.

The campaigns are themed around real events or activities in these areas (e.g. escorting a UN humanitarian convoy during the Bosnian War, fighting pirates in the South China Sea, etc.)\n\nA typical campaign consists of four or five missions. Each mission has a primary objective that must be completed to successfully complete the mission, there are other targets in each missions such as tanks and SAM launchers but these are only used to help the player boost their score. The primary target is usually a major structure like an enemy base or a bridge.\n\nUsually the player is equipped with a standard set of weapons - 16 missiles, 76 rockets, and a machine gun with unlimited ammunition. On some special missions the rockets are replaced by a weapon that is critical to the success of that particular mission, such as a runway cratering system when the primary objective is to destroy an airbase or a bomb when destruction of a bridge is the primary objective.\n\nThe control system for Thunderhawk was fairly unique for the platforms supporting a mouse. It used the mouse for basic control, plus some keyboard input for rarely used commands. Moving the mouse would tilt the helicopter in the specified direction, and make it start moving in that direction. Pressing the left mouse button fires weapons. When the right mouse button was held, moving the mouse up and down changed altitude, while side to side yawed the helicopter side to side.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3eiy.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":12903,"name":"Legends of Valour","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The city of Mittledorf is in chaos - an evil cousin of the King is oppressing the people.

Notably, the game was sponsored by Smiths' British snack Quavers (now owned by Walkers), where the game plot revolves around the then Quavers mascot 'Colin Curly' losing his Quavers packets down a giant ant hill. The player is then tasked with controlling 'G.I. Ant', a large soldier ant, to recover the Quavers by solving a series of puzzles. The SNES version lacks the Quavers branding, and instead the aim is to recover bundles of cash dropped down the ant hill by Captain Rat.\n\nThe game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds. Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of \"dominoes\". The aim is to rearrange the dominoes, such that with a single push, all of the dominoes are toppled, thus opening the exit to the next level. There are 11 different types of domino, identified by red and yellow patterns, each with different actions. The player controls G.I. Ant, who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time.\n\nVarious factors can result in failure to complete a level. As well as toppling all of the dominoes, the player must be able to access the exit door once the dominoes have fallen. For instance, the player will be unable to reach the exit if a ledge leading to the exit has been destroyed, or if a gap leading to the exit has not been bridged, or if a line of dominoes lie across the exit. G.I. Ant may die by falling from a large height, by falling off the bottom of the screen, or by being crushed under a falling domino. The player is then greeted with the message \"You Failed, You Died\" and has to restart the level. Also, the level will be failed if any dominoes are destroyed by landing one domino on top of another.\n\nEach level has a time limit during which it must be completed. However, if the time runs out the player is still able to continue with the puzzle if they wish. By pausing the game once the time has run out, a small hint will be displayed, giving advice on how to complete the level. As a side note, the hint for level 98 informs the player that the game's designer cannot remember how to complete the level without trickery (\"Use a drop! There is a way to make it work with a push, but I can't find it!\").\n\nThe themed worlds, in order, are an industrial complex, an Aztec world, a space station, an electronic world, a Greek temple, a Medieval castle, a Meccano-inspired world, a dungeon and a Japanese temple. Each world has 11 levels, making a total of 99 regular levels. A packet of Colin's Quavers is retrieved after each world, with nine packets in all to be collected. Many of the early levels are tutorials demonstrating how each type of domino will act. Often there is only a single solution to each level, though some levels have multiple solutions. The final level, level 100, must be completed using dominoes with hidden markings.\n\nA password system allows the player to continue an earlier game, without having to restart from the first level. Additionally, upon completing a level the player gains a token, which once a level has been failed, allows the player to return to the point before the domino push, rather than having to return to the initial state of the level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5z4a.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":11387,"name":"Dangerous Dave Returns","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":11375,"name":"Creatures II: Torture Trouble","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The game is composed of three islands, each with a set of stages that have to be completed.

Every 10,000 points a special block will appear (the Acid Drop) which removes three columns of blocks and marks the beginning of the next level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co50j6.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":11100,"name":"Battle Isle Data Disk I","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jtofx2cgevczhzcgjqtn.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":11099,"name":"Battle Chess 4000","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Welcome to the chess game of tomorrow!\n\nYesteryear's timeless classic is now a game for all ages in Battle Chess 4000.

It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, Ishar, whose name means \"unknown\" in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.\n\nMost of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jiz.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":10855,"name":"Bunny Bricks","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bunny Bricks as ridiculed in the Mega Fun Party 3 demo","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nsyzs9opjnsqhiwwekel.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":10853,"name":"Storm Master","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Storm Master is a 1991 video game for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC, produced by the now-defunct French developer Silmarils, which placed the player as the head of government for a fictional semi-medieval country.\n\nSimilarly to most of the games produced by Silmarils, Storm Master took place on a European-fantasy world. Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.[1][2]\n\nThe game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This took the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and required the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game involved the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay was further enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state. The game was further noted by Amiga Action as having an innovative 'advance through time' feature, allowing the player some control over the rate at which time passed in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wyygzodgopgfztnhj8l1.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}]},{"id":10353,"name":"Outlander","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"There's no turning back.

These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens.\n\nGame play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.\n\nAs there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co49mf.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"3DO Interactive Multiplayer"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"}]},{"id":4525,"name":"Andre Agassi Tennis","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early 90s with his \"Image is everything\" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight players (male and female and as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.\n\nGameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.\nThree courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a \"Skins\" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2l16.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Game Gear"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"}]},{"id":4510,"name":"The Games: Summer Challenge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer edition includes 8 events from athletics to cycling. The events are:\n\nKayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added\nArchery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow.\n\n400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending the event.\n\nHigh Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared.\nEquestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.\n\nJavelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well\nCycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling.\n\nLike with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to ten human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from). It's also possible to replay and even store your best (or worst) moments.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ny7hxotmoayg7xnehseb.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":4494,"name":"WarpSpeed","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The player takes control of a starpilot with a mission to defend star bases from a fleet of invading alien warships.

Janken Disk Shiro is a block-pushing puzzle game based on the playground game Janken (Rock, Paper, Scissors).\n\nJanken Disk Shiro, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 Janken Disk Shiro, is a puzzle game in which the protagonist (who looks uncannily like Disk-kun, the mascot of the Famicom Disk System) must brave a labyrinth of puzzles. In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the \"scissors\" gesture, the \"rock\" gesture or the \"paper\" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a \"strength\" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).\n\nGameplay revolves around finding the right blocks to push together to clear a way to the exit. Not every block needs to be eliminated: just those that are direct obstacles between the player and the end of the stage.\n\nThe game adopts a familiar veneer of the typical 8-bit fantasy RPG: The player starts in a small town in which they can talk to NPCs and purchase power-ups, they can visit the King in his castle to begin their quest and they can visit the dungeons in which the puzzles are found (after receiving permission from the King).\n\nJanken Disk Shiro has the distinction of being the very last game ever produced for the Famicom Disk System. The peripheral had been effectively retired by the 90s due to advancements in NES cart technology.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xz8tczcgqp1shh7vedtn.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer Disk System"}]},{"id":1534,"name":"Pocky & Rocky","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pocky was enjoying a quiet cup of tea in her shrine, when Rocky the Raccoon, a Nopino goblin came running to Pocky.\n\n\"Something terrible has happened.

Most characters are given a special wrestling throw of their own, like in Final Fight and The Punisher.\n\nIn the Japanese version, the game follows Liu Bei's plight in Jingzhou from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a history-based novel from China, set in the Three Kingdoms period as Cao Cao sets to invade his lands. In the English adaptation, however, the Three Kingdoms theme was lost, and most names have been changed to names of Mongolian origin.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gh5.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":37681,"name":"Kyuukyoku Mahjong","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An adult Mahjong game.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}]},{"id":22611,"name":"Links 386 Pro","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The follow up to Links - The Challenge of Golf, Links 386 Pro features Harbour Town Golf Links course.
