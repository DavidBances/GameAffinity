The Tandor region is known for its gym challenge: to qualify, trainers must collect 8 gym badges from around the region in order to compete in the prestigous Tandor Regional Tournament. Trainers that win the Tournament get a huge prize as well as world wide renown.\n\nYou, a 13-year-old kid from Moki Town, did not set out to become a Pokemon Master. After your mother Lucille died ten years ago in an accident at a nuclear power plant, your father Kellyn, the top Pokemon Ranger in the Tandor Ranger Union, left you with your elderly aunt and departed to travel the region. But now that you are grown up, your aunt can no longer support you. Out of a home, you did what most kids your age do and took up Pokémon training as a means to make a living.\n\nProfessor Bamb'o, regional expert on Pokémon elements, has been looking for a trainer assistant to travel the region and gather specimens of the varied wildlife. You step up to the challenge, along with your rival, a younger boy named Theo. After taking a test and receiving your starter Pokémon, you head towards your first gym challenge in Nowtoch city, and take your first steps exploring the Tandor region.\n\nThings aren't as sunny as they first seem, though. Just when the accident ten years ago had been all but forgotten, new mysteries emerge. A new power plant is built over the site of the old one. Your father begins acting strangely, journeying to the far reaches of the region and questioning whether your mother is really deceased. Sinister Pokemon, corrupted by nuclear radiation, threaten innocent people. In the midst ofthe turmoil, it seems that an impending disaster is looming over Tandor... You may be in for more than you expected.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dcl.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Uranium Team","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":24950,"name":"Memory of a Broken Dimension","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You dredge the satellite transmission.

The suit gives the player special abilities at the cost of the player's sanity. The exoskeleton comes with the abilities to slow down time, ala Max Payne and to rewind time. However, overuse of these abilities will cause the sanity bar to deplete making your character lose touch with reality. When the sanity bar depletes your character starts to hallucinate, altering gameplay mechanics and level design.\n\nIn each stage, the player navigates his way from left to right through platforming sections, death traps, and enemies. The goal is to do this as fast as possible with the least amount of deaths. The fast pace of the game can make it difficult to plan a perfect approach. To make up for this, the game allows the player to restart each stage the moment they die, allowing them to quickly fine-tune their approach over several attempts. At the end of each chapter the player must also defeat a unique boss. Along the way the player acquires a number of weapons and upgrades that you can cycle through, all of which have a specific use.\n\nThe game grades the player's performance at the end of each stage based on a number of factors and given a percentage raring out of 100.

Start building your transport empire by creating bus routes between as many cites as possible.

This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\n\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your buses, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks.\n\nKey game features:\n- transport passengers between bus stations\n- a variety of bus models\n- build roads, stations, traffic lights completely free\n- upgrade stations to large bus hubs\n- upgrade gas station to offer different fuel types\n- beautiful night and day graphics, automatic or manual settings\n- build road network freely\n- build traffic lights to each junction\n- automatic breakdown generation\n- automatic road crack generation\n- various demolishing tools\n\nThe developer's notes:\nIf you liked the game, please provide us with feedback or a review and rate the game.

Game is currently in early development with set goals.\n\n* PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD - You will play a robot as the main protagonist of Floatlands, going up against other robots. Game world will consist of several biomes: jungle, desert, sea and snow. These worlds will be unique all the time because they will be randomly generated. Islands and natural elements will have certain similarities, but altogether the world will be unique every time.\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scorched-sunset-lowpoly-floatlands.png\n\n* QUESTING, POINTS OF INTEREST - There will be random events/quests (defending, collecting, exploring) across the world for you to complete. Quests, missions will also be randomly generated in order to bring the unpredictability aspect to the game.\n\nhttps://i0.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/quest-character-lowpoly-floatlands-2.png\n\n* PLAYING STYLES - You can choose different play styles when playing in the world of Floatlands. You can be an explorer or you can be an aggressive player that wants to eliminate threats of well being.\n\n* RESOURCE GATHERING - Important part will be the resource gathering aspect. Some basics: Shooting down robot enemies will provide you scrap metal; by chopping trees you will gain wood; sheep is a source for wool; you will also find resources in caves. Certain materials need to be processed and smelted in order to be used for building structures.\n\n* CUSTOM BUILD MODE - With gathered resources you’ll be able to build and upgrade your own custom base/shelter and defend from enemies. At this moment there are 50 different build parts you can use to build your base. There are also 3 tiers – wood (starting tier), stone and fortified stone (highest tier for now). Build mode mixed with random generated terrain provides a multitude of options (basic shacks, castles…), so it will be interesting in this regard.\n\n* ELECTRIC SYSTEM - One other major feature in game is electricity which will provide you with different options in the game - repairing your robot, powering up the lights and your defense system (turrets). We are in the process of making various props that will need a source of energy. Generators will be that source and with cables you'll have the option to connect devices yourself. You will have to fill generators with fuel to get them to work.\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/electricity_connection_lowpoly_floatlands.png","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ouaxx1g0bmqrfg6lcfyo.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Studio Techtrics","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":25206,"name":"Mark McMorris Infinite Air","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mark McMorris Infinite Air is a fresh welcome into snowboarding for newcomers and a challenging step into untracked territory for seasoned boarders.
