It is now listed under Quests and Adventures, since there is no New Lands category.\n\nThey said it couldn't be done... Daggerfall is too big to fit in the TESV engine... And they were, on the one hand, right! You cannot capture the grand scale or the nearly endless possibilities that exist in a world larger than England! Yet, for all of its vastness and promise, Daggerfall remains a world unfamiliar to many Elder Scrolls fans. The mechanics and graphics feel dated to say the least, and its sometimes unreasonable time limits for quests as well as quest-breaking bugs left many players, even back in the '90's, so frustrated that perhaps a majority of players never finished the Main Quest, preferring to simply explore the world on their own terms, joining guilds or Knightly Orders, or becoming a vampire or a wereboar. And that is a shame, because the Main Quest is actually quite a good story. The purpose of this mod is not to replace TESII: Daggerfall, but to bring some of its magic and lore to Elder Scrolls fans of the Skyrim generation that would never otherwise experience it, as well as perhaps delight those fans of the original game that would love to see the Main Quest in an updated engine, complete with voice acting, re-mastered music and better graphics.\n\nPlease note that the Main Quest of Daggerfall is NOT about choice. You are role-playing as the Emperor's friend on an important mission, so, while the order in which you tackle these quests is your choice, it is assumed that you want to finish the Main Quest and so you will not be able to refuse the quest-givers' requests. At this point, there really isn't much of anything other than the Main Quest for you to do in Daggerfall, anyway!\n\nI have worked on this mod in my spare time for a little over two years, and have had a lot of fun learning about various aspects that go into making a large mod the size of a dlc. I'm not much of a 3D artist, so I've had to rely on a lot of resources to put this mod together, and you will see that the credits list is quite long. I have tried to include, where possible, those models from artists who have made resources to see something from Daggerfall come to later Elder Scrolls games, such as JMan0WarS, who remade Privateer's Hold for Morrowind as well as Direnni Tower for Oblivion, Lord Berandas and BobJohnson99.
