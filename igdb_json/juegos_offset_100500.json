You can quit the game at any time and continue exactly where you left off later. There is an undo for any mistakes you might make and you always have a history of your last 8 scores available.\n\nThe rules for the Space 2048 game are very simple. There are only four game moves. Use the arrow buttons or swipe on the screen to move to the left, the right, the top or the bottom. All planets will then move into that direction as far as they can. Planets of the same kind will merge into a new planet with their combined value and your score is updated. You win once you have one planet with the value of 2048. And that is much easier said then done.\n\nVisuals are a big part of the gaming experience and to match the overall theme all interface elements like the triple setting sound switch for example (full sound with background music, effects only or sound off) rotate floating in space. And while the true stars - pun intended - of Space 2048 are the planets with their magnificent slow rotation, they are more than matched in grandiosity by those fascinating backdrops.

With the help of this crescent, the hero can turn into totally different young men - which will naturally increase his chances in impressing girls and ultimately having sex with them.\n\nCan Can Bunny Spirits is much less of an adventure and more of a strategy game than its predecessors. Success depends even more on the preparations before the actual decisive stage. There is also extensive customization in this game. In the beginning, the hero chooses what he wants to be like, which includes age, height, blood type, and other parameters. Then Ariko introduces several girls to him, of which he has to choose one. Afterwards, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving the right answers, combining knowledge of the girl's preferences and of the character's statistics. Each girl has a \"love meter that can be raised or lowered depending on the player's strategies, and once it is full, the hero can have his way with the girl.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kw4.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"}]},{"id":108895,"name":"Can Can Bunny Premiere","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant. One day he comes home and finds seven strange creatures sitting at his table and discussing something you have no clue about. But before you decide to throw the uninvited guests out of your apartment, a beautiful green-haired woman appears. This is the goddess Swatty, and she has power over the Seven Lucky Gods, which the mysterious seven creatures turn out to be. Swatty feels pity for the lonely hero, and decides to help him to find a girlfriend.\n\nCan Can Bunny Premier is the fourth installment in the Can Can Bunny series. Compared to its predecessors, it is the most pure Japanese-style adventure, without the strategy parts of the previous game. The player chooses menu commands (\"Look\", \"Talk\", etc., as well as context-sensitive commands and dialogue choices) in order to advance the game. At several points it is possible to branch the story line, which mostly influences the amount of success the hero has had with a girl.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8eur.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cocktail Soft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Stack","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ides","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"}]},{"id":108896,"name":"RagnaQuest","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":108897,"name":"Kingdom Story: Brave Legion","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qi3.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":108898,"name":"War Attack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Free FPS multiplayer game playable in your web browser.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":108899,"name":"Disconnected","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Disconnected is a short surreal horror game.\n\nYou decide to hang out with a friend.

Teachers use the game in conjunction with teaching materials to provide an intertwined course based on English, Maths, Science, Drama and Art.

As they explore the world, they will encounter situations based on basic English (such as word puzzles), compass reading, telling the time and learning to read a map's scale. Clues are given to them through the game's museum and an old hermit, who tells them of an old explorer who was trying to hatch dinosaurs on a far-off isolated island.\n\nThe game also featured an explorer's journal for students to read. This journal provides insight into the professor's journey throughout the game's various environments. It also talks of his meeting with the hermit, and how he succumbs to illness. The final entry is in different handwriting from the rest of the journal, and is by the hermit, who writes that the professor died the previous night and that he has buried him in the desert.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co301x.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jacaranda Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Brian Christmas","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"4Mation Educational Resources Ltd","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"}]},{"id":109173,"name":"A Light Inside","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109174,"name":"Basketball Hero","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109175,"name":"Gravity","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Utilizing a gravity-altering black hole, players must help particles maneuver past obstacles and travel to their destinations.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":109176,"name":"Smurfs Bubble Story","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109177,"name":"Grimms Nightmare","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109178,"name":"Rio: Match 3 Party","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109179,"name":"Awesome Animated Monster Maker: Ultra Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109180,"name":"Hyper-Galactic Spiders from Mars","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109181,"name":"Kakosatsu","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109182,"name":"Panzer Campaign VII: Kursk '43","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109183,"name":"Shimaise","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":109184,"name":"Flow Free","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Flow Free is a simple yet addictive puzzle game.\n\nConnect matching colors with pipe to create a Flow.
