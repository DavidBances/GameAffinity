Its speech synthesis was a first at the time. \n \nYou are Jérôme Lange, a famous private investigator, involved in the strange events of the Mortville Manor. The game can be solved extremely quickly if you are given the solution. After a French computer magazine published a walkthrough, allowing its readers to solve the game without even having understood the plot, an altered version was published and replaced the original. This new version was completely identical except that at a specific point in the adventure, the player had to correctly answer a series of questions about the game's plot to be allowed to continue further. \n \nThe game was written by Bernard Grelaud and Bruno Gourier, with illustrations by Dominique Sablons with Maria-Dolores. Music and voices were provided by Beatrice Langlois and Jean-Luc Langlois. \"Le Manoir de Morteveille\" was subsequently translated into English (Mick Andon) and German. A version for PC was released in 1988, adapted by Clement Roques. \n \nMortville Manor was followed by its sequel Maupiti Island, taking place on a tropical island.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":38865,"name":"Sensible World of Soccer '96/'97","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sensible World of Soccer '96/'97 is an updated version of Sensible World of Soccer: European Championship Edition.

It’s time to unleash your energi once again and enjoy an immersive experience in a new and exciting world honed to perfection with a massive graphical overhaul, richly developed characters, and a streamlined battle system!\n\nAlphadia II takes players on an unforgettable adventure 200 years after the events of the first Alphadia. Though after seemingly being lost to the inhabitants of the world, energi once again makes its appearance, and before long begins to drive opposing powers into an all out scramble to take control of this ever diminishing resource.\n\nEnergi… the source of power interconnected with all living things.\n\nIn times of old, the human race erected a great civilization that thrived on the use of this power. However, some two centuries earlier, an incident known as the Energi Crisis erupted and led to the planet's energi being sealed away. As a result, people lost the mysterious powers they were once capable of harnessing.\n\nThe story now picks up with the protagonist, Leon, who has been assigned to his first solo mission by the Energi Guild. And there within his mind echo the words of the guildmistress when she stated: \"Energi is the hidden power within each individual. It is the power of the heart and mind, and when purposefully sought, its true potential is unleashed.\"\n\nNostalgia at its best! It’s like old-school meets new-school with perfect harmony!\nSporting a colorful and gorgeously detailed 2D battle system, individual break skills, elementals that combine to create more powerful energi skills, and even an auto-battle function, Alphadia II comes equipped with everything fans of traditional JRPGs could expect and caters to both the hardcore and casual gamer alike!\n\nEnergi is the key!\nEnergi is derived from one of six unique elementals and has the power to not only grow, but lead players to the acquisition of new and more powerful energi skills. These energi skills then, in turn, play an integral role in attack, recovery, and even support. Furthermore, once two separate elementals have reached a certain level, they can be combined to create even more powerful energi skills!\n\nCan you handle it?!\nAside from a voluminous story, Alphadia II offers a new \"Mission\" system in which players are able to accept missions from the guild in order to receive valuable coins. These coins can then be exchanged for powerful equipment and other hard-to-get items later on. In addition to the main story and missions is a wealth of subquests, making this title truly the whole package. In fact, after finishing the game, there may be still much more to do than one might think!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dqbxvnsbubgsdnmjjklv.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kemco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":38965,"name":"Rival Books of Aster","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rival Books of Aster is a strategy deck building game that features over 140 hand illustrated spells that you can use to build custom decks and go head to head against other players.

In this paradise managed by robots there is not any crime, taxes, unemployment, or freedom. The population lives in a domed \"megapolis,\" and perhaps due to the war that occurred during Return to Eden, there is not any contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of flying saucers keeps the population afraid from going outside. \n \nThe main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he awakens. It was only a simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available during the reign of the third Kim. This \"Garden of Eden as a prison\" allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers. \nDevelopment \n \nThe Worm in Paradise is the third and final instalment of the Silicon Dreams trilogy and is a departure from the previous games. It \"evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9's own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word vocabulary, a very highly-advanced English input, memory-enhancing text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated type-ahead, and multi-tasking so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn.\" This was the first game using version 3 of the A-Code system. It was released for four fewer platforms, excluding the Lynx, Memotech MTX, Nascom and Oric-1 compared to the two previous releases. \n \nAnother difference is that the player has only seven days, within the game's clock, to complete the game. Quests are also time-based and require that the player arrive at certain locations at specific hours to achieve the desired goal. And while game play remains the same, the backdrop is no longer an action adventure, but a political thriller that resembles the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Similar to what happened when Snowball was released, there was certain confusion about the main character's identity and the time when the story is set. The Level 9 Fact Sheet says: \"...a couple of years later, Kim Kimberley has become a legend on Eden.\" Another article stated: \"Worm in Paradise is set 100 years later. You are now Kim Kimberley III...\" Furthermore, Pete Austin said, \"Worm is set on Eden, about 50 years in the future\" and \"The player is not Kim - she becomes mayor and runs the place.\" Notice that these sources termed the game by its original name, Worm in Paradise.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":39156,"name":"Silicon Dreams - Return to Eden","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Plot \n \nWith the Snowball 9 orbiting Eden, the surviving crew members put Kim on trial. The only evidence against her is the \"mempak\" from the control room, which shows her as the hijacker rather than the saviour. Despite the fact that the recording is damaged and thus is unreliable, they sentence her to death. About to be thrown into space, Kim manages to escape aboard a \"stratoglider\" and an hour later, lands on Eden. At this point the game starts. \n \nThe first thing the player must do is find a shelter for Kim, because a few moves into the game the Snowball 9 crew use the ship's engine to try to burn her down. The native robots take this as proof that the Snowball 9 is not the ship they were expecting but a hostile alien craft they must destroy. The objective is to contact the robots before time ends for the Snowball 9 and everyone aboard it. \n \nDevelopment \n \nUnlike its predecessor, Return to Eden only had about two hundred and fifty locations, but it was Level 9's first game to feature graphics.[5] Other adventure games had included graphics before, but version 2 of the A-Code system, allowed Level 9 to encode location graphics into as little as forty bytes. This size made it possible to add graphics to every location of the game for all formats with more than 32 K RAM. The user could choose not to display them and play the game in text-only mode. It was released for the same platforms as its predecessor. \n \nThe game's first cover depicted a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled a comic book character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration depicted another robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was not satisfied with the result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles. \n \nPete Austin commented on the game: \"It's an alien theme park gone wild. The Eden universe is more like Larry Niven's future space.\" and \"...is intended as a comment on superpower intervention in the Third World.\"","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":39157,"name":"Silicon Dreams - Snowball","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Plot \n \nAs the Snowball 9 approaches Eden, something goes wrong. A crew member murders her shipmates, destroys the communication system and sets the ship on a collision course with the sun. The robots, being little more than automata, continue their everyday operations oblivious to the danger but the ship's computer, capable of thinking, awakens Kim Kimberley before the deranged crew member destroys it. She exits her modified stasis chamber with the goal of finding a way to reach the control room and avert disaster. \nDevelopment \n \nSnowball was originally released during 1983 as the company's fourth adventure game using the A-Code system.[1] Nick, Mike, and Pete Austin headed development. Though Level 9's previous games featured a fantasy theme, the Austin brothers chose a science fiction theme.[5] The original release used version 1 of this system[6] and was initially released only for the BBC Micro, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Nascom,[7] but was later followed by versions for the Commodore 64, Camputers Lynx, Oric-1, Atari 8-bit[8] as well as for the Memotech MTX, Amstrad CPC, Enterprise and MSX.[9] It is noteworthy for including over seven thousand locations. To achieve this sixty-eight hundred locations on the passenger disks form a colour-coded maze with minimal descriptions. \n \nAnother peculiar aspect of the game was the confusion behind the main character's gender. In an interview for Sinclair User, Chris Bourne asked, \"Is the androgynous Kim a man or woman?\" Pete Austin pointed out that \"there's a credit at the end for the design of 'Ms Kimberley's costume,' \" but also admitted that Kim Kimberley was \"a deliberately unisex name.\" The debate came to an end with the release of Return to Eden, where it was made more explicit that Kim was not a man, because the surviving crew members confuse her with the woman who tried to destroy the ship.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":39158,"name":"Jewels of Darkness: Dungeon Adventure","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The final game in the Jewels of Darkness trilogy.\n\nDungeon Adventure concludes Level 9's Middle Earth lineage of fantasy interactive fiction games.

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War.

But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire.\nPetun—little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map.
