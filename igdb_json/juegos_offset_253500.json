The game is played in side-view and consists of 16 stages (plus 16 back stages).\n\nIn the battle against the enemy, you can use either the robot form, which has a tracking laser but inferior mobility, or the fighter form, which can only attack in the direction you are going but has superior mobility, depending on the situation. Barriers are also available, but if they are used too often, they will run out of energy, so they should be used only when the situation calls for it! You should use them only when you need them.\n\nThe game is based on the life system with no save function, so you only have one shot each time you play!
