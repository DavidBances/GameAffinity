In an isolated monastery with an already mysterious reputation, any one of the Sisters could be the killer—and Mother Superior is as stumped as anyone else. That's where you come in.\n\nAs an Anchoress, you took an oath to never leave your cell; to devote yourself entirely to God and provide spiritual support to all who came to your door. But as the only Sister who couldn't possibly have committed the crime, you have a new mission: solve the case, before the bishop shutters the convent and the killer goes unpunished.\n\nThe Superior hasn't told everyone why you've suddenly joined the regular congregation, but something tells you most of these women know exactly what's going on. Who can you trust? Who is being honest, and who has their guard up—and why? Is the convent really haunted? Who killed Sister Catherine?
