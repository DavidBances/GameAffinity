A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends.\nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether.\nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co53gv.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"WildTangent","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bandai","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gameloft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Q Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":4690,"name":"Lumines II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The gameplay in Lumines II is very similar to its predecessor, Lumines.

To make matters worse however, the machine is now protected by mutated food.\n\nThe player has to fight and puzzle their way through twenty levels, using Flint's self created gadgets such as a hair dryer converted into a heat gun, which can be used to melt obstacles composed of ice cream, or a mechanical boxing glove to punch food.

The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first “Haunted House Simulator” where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory.

Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.\n\nTarget Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.\n\nDefender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.\n\nRanger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.\n\nThe Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ocw.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo EAD Software Development Group No.3","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":4974,"name":"Little King's Story","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"\"Initially released for Wii to rave reviews, this cult classic real-time strategy game juxtaposes cutesy fairytale visuals with some decidedly adult cynicism for a zany, irreverent adventure to build, enhance, and maintain a mystical, magical kingdom.

In addition to navigating the main characters around the mansion grounds, players are able to enter Viewfinder Mode, where the camera is raised and the view changes to that of the camera's frame. In viewfinder mode the player is able to snap photographs of ghosts, both violent and benign, which is the main method of progressing through the game. Items are also available, some being consumable and most being key items needed to unlock doors, complete tasks or solve puzzles. Puzzles are encountered frequently in the game, some being based on the same concept but becoming progressively more difficult. The varying difficulty settings of the game (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Fatal (Xbox only)) determine the amount of consumable items scattered throughout the mansion and how formidable the enemies are.\n\nThe main horror aspect of the game is, undoubtedly, the ghosts. The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player. The ghosts' appearances are usually inspired by their deaths or by Japanese stigmas of horror, which, some argue, are particularily chilling.\n\nThe game, depending on which console it is played on, offers two endings. Upon completion of the game, a ranking is given based on total time taken, points accumulated and other categories. The player is also given rewards and unlockables, such as alternate costumes and camera functions, depending on what difficulty was beaten, how much of the Ghost List was completed and other criteria. Beating the game also unlocks Battle Mode, where the player is faced with fighting specific ghosts, and is rewarded with points towards purchasing unlockables. An option is also given where the game can be replayed with all equipment, upgrades and unlockables carried over.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7nlq.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Wanadoo Edition","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":5107,"name":"Fatal Frame III: The Tormented","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Rei Kurosawa suffers a strange dream each night, since she took a photo of her dead boyfriend in an abandoned old mansion.\n\nEvery night the dream will take her deeper and deeper in an old mansion, when she will have to find out what is going on.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ov1.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tecmo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Take-Two Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":5109,"name":"Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity is an exciting puzzle game released on Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS.
