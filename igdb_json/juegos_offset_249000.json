By beating certain opponents, Sugata faces new challengers based on his performance.

Points are awarded for accuracy with bonus multipliers awarded for making certain 'combos' (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long). This is a game for one or two players with three difficulty settings, easy, hard and medium. The player selects their difficulty level and their track and then attempts to score points by hitting the correct buttons in sequence. During the song the player is treated to an distant view of an animated disco dancer on a stage and illuminated with coloured lights. Once the track is over the player can enter their name, assuming they have achieved a high score. The game holds eight scores for each of the three difficulty levels but no scores are recorded for Workout and Recorder modes. The game has a workout mode in which the player first enters their weight, in kilograms, and then selects a track. Gameplay here is basically the same as the main game but instead of points the game calculates the number of calories burned. There is no difficulty setting for this game mode and the arrows come thick and fast. The Recorder option allows the player to create and save their own dance, there is no high score for this and while the dance moves are preserved from one game to the next only one routine can be saved.

He condemns the king and abducts Princess Emilia. In order to rescue Emilia, King Valsia assembles a squad of royal knights led by Irina, Emilia's educator, to venture into the witch's domain.\n\nHowever, the forest where the witch resides is fraught with perilous paths infested with ferocious monsters. Additionally, apart from the main characters belonging to the royal knights, there is also Lord Raidric, a nobleman accompanied by the ruthless Black Knight Balnarg, who seeks to outshine the main characters.\n\nAs the adventure begins, the strength of the monsters proves to be beyond imagination, and Irina's inexperienced group quickly faces near annihilation. Their fate becomes precarious, especially after losing the mage who was guiding them through the forest. However, at this critical moment, they happen to encounter a young magician named Merian who is under attack by monsters. The protagonist, the sole survivor under Irina's command, successfully rescues her. With her assistance, and her knowledge of Karakuram, Irina and her group of three set out once again towards the mansion of the witch Karakuram.\n\nThe gameplay is a first person perspective ADV in which the player will have to take decisions that will leave the story to different places.\nThroughout the game, various mysteries are unraveled, including the reasons behind Karakuram's abduction of Emilia.\nEven if no heroine is successfully pursued, a happy ending can be achieved by completing the journey safely. However, depending on the choices, the protagonist may lose to enemies, resulting in a game over. In some cases, heroines may also suffer unfortunate fates at the hands of monsters, but there are no particularly explicit or gory CG scenes in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co75rw.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Penguin Works","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"KID","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":269409,"name":"Cart Kings","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This licensed racing game features characters from the comics magazines Tinkle and Amar Chitra Katha.

The theme of the game is based on Japanese manga/anime series Star of the Giants. The main game consists of 3 different variants of the slot machines, which feature two side bars that interact based on how you score and if you activate any bonuses or meet certain conditions. These feature characters from the series, with voice acting and Japanese humor. The library allows users to play with the sounds and music, view a catalog about the machine, or even view the staging for various transitions without playing through the game repeatedly. Although, it's still up to luck if you'll complete it, you can hear the voice acting and see the effects that the machine uses in this mode. Pachislot games are a cross between pachinko machines and western style slot machines. They play more like western style machines, although they often feature mechanical enhancements, animations, mini-games, and various ways of getting bonuses that are more complex than other some other machines.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9978.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":269493,"name":"DoraSlot: Oki-Slot-Ou!

With the DS microphone, both listen to the radio or exciting bedtime stories. And if the kitten can't fall asleep, the players simply sing him a lullaby. Depending on how trusting it is, it can even learn fun tricks in the fitness room. But the little wildcat also needs attention and affection in other areas: great all-round care with a shower, hair dryer, grooming and of course a wildcat toilet in the bathroom, feeding in the kitchen, choosing suitable clothing, taking care of small ailments or gifts such as a new toy mouse for a birthday and room decorations. Fun with the cute baby wild cats is guaranteed!

But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl. And remember - You Gotta Believe! PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm. The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow. You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back. Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased. Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage. Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps. Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!\n\nThe PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.
