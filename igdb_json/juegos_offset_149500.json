Using just their fingertips, the partner can distract pursuing cops, switch from night to day or activate enhanced performance for any car and even control the amount of traffic on the road.For another competitive edge, players can switch into their favorite cars, track milestones, uncover the city’s hidden gems and more, all on the fly with the Wii U touch screen, ensuring nothing ever slows them down.\n\nNeed for Speed Most Wanted U brings the blockbuster action of the open world racer to players’ fingertips. The entire game is playable off-screen using the Wii U GamePad, so gamers never have to put the game down.\n\nNeed for Speed Most Wanted U includes the Ultimate Speed Pack expansion, so players can take to the streets with five of the most absurdly fast cars ever made: McLaren’s F1 LM, Lamborghini’s minimalist artwork, the Aventador J, the track-focused Pagani Zonda R, Bugatti’s reigning world speed champion, the Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse and Hennessey’s savage 275 mile-an-hour ragtop beast, the Venom GT Spyder.\n\nFinally with Need for Speed Most Wanted U, gamers are competing against the people they want to defeat most – their friends. With EA’s innovative online technology Autolog 2, the game automatically tracks and compares best race times, high scores and more. These stats are broadcast throughout the open world, fueling friendly competition and rivalries.Need for Speed Most Wanted’s online multiplayer also ups the ante for social competition. Gamers pick a car, meet up with their friends and are immersed in a non-stop playlist of action-packed events.

The narrative revolves around Kratos, the protagonist from earlier instalments, who was once a loyal servant of the God of War, Ares. Tricked by Ares into unknowingly murdering his own family, Kratos breaks the blood oath binding him to Ares and abandons his former master. Subsequently, Kratos finds himself imprisoned and must navigate a path to freedom, severing the bond between him and Ares.\n\nThe game retains the familiar hack-and-slash combat system of its predecessors, featuring Kratos wielding the Blades of Chaos. However, a new addition, the World Weapon system, allows Kratos to wield various weapons. Additionally, Kratos can now acquire up to four magical disciplines—Fires of Ares, Ice of Poseidon, Lightning of Zeus, and Soul of Hades—each bestowing unique abilities and imbuing his weapon with magic. For instance, the Ice of Poseidon enables underwater breathing. Rage, a recurring feature, undergoes modifications; it accumulates through attacks, and when the bar is full, it automatically unleashes until the player ceases attacking or sustains damage. Three new relics provide Kratos with the ability to manipulate time, create a \"shadow\" self, and dispel illusions crafted by his guardians.\n\nNotably, God of War: Ascension introduces online multiplayer to the series. Players, before engaging in multiplayer battles, align with one of four gods—Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon—each offering a distinct set of abilities. As players accumulate experience and level up their warriors, they unlock magical abilities, armour, weapons, relics, and other treasures. The game features four distinct multiplayer modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, and Capture the Flag","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3die.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SCE Santa Monica Studio","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":457,"name":"StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are Sarah Kerrigan, former Queen of Blades.

It is not a direct sequel/prequel to any of the previous BioShock games but takes place in an entirely different setting, although it shares similar features, gameplay and concepts with the previous games. BioShock Infinite features a range of environments that force the player to adapt, with different weapons and strategies for each situation. Interior spaces feature close combat with enemies, but unlike previous games set in Rapture, the setting of Infinite contains open spaces with emphasis on sniping and ranged combat against as many as fifteen enemies at once.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2n12.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Aspyr Media","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Human Head Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Virtual Programming","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Australia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Irrational Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":202333,"name":"Soul Song","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Soul Song is a Chinese Yume Nikki fangame.
