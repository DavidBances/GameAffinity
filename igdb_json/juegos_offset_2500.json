These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.\nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\".\nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events.\nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them.\nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins).\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player.\nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2nhp.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Criterion Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"}]},{"id":2627,"name":"Zoocube","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Created by PuzzleKings, ZooCube takes puzzlers to a whole new dimension - the third dimension.

These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n\nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co53lb.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Neversoft Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Budcat Creations","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Vicarious Visions","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":2673,"name":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith puts the player in the shoes of \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\" as they evolve from unknowns to rock superstars.

Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.\n\nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc.\n\nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wni.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Neversoft Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Budcat Creations","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":2675,"name":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen lets you stand in the shoes of this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band as you perform 25 epic Van Halen tracks, three signature Eddie Van Halen solos and 19 guest act tracks.

Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the \"Top 40\" pop rock hits, while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers. They also contested the cost of the full game, featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5, and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form.

The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to Guitar Hero's Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.\n\nA single player career mode is available, as well both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes (\"DJ vs DJ\"), playable locally or remotely. Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with Guitar Hero and other compatible guitar controllers in a \"DJ vs Guitar\" mode. Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix. A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ri1.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Exient Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"FreeStyleGames","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":2680,"name":"DJ Hero 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The follow up to the award-winning #1 new videogame IP of 2009, DJ Hero 2 will transform living rooms into nightclubs all over again with an entirely new music-gaming experience.

You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. Not everyone in the world of Mercenaries is as honorable.

The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6njq.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Midway","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco Limited","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Dempa Shimbunsha","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"FM-7"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":2752,"name":"Gee Bee","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Pinball","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Namco's first independently designed video arcade game, Gee Bee combines gameplay elements of pinball and Breakout.\n\nThere are two paddles, one at the bottom and one in the middle, that stay aligned when moving, so players must pay attention to both when bouncing the ball.

The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people.\n\nHaving escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok.\n\nTak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea. Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength.\n\nThe Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted.

The gold and gems you carry when you die increases your score, but it is heavy too.\n\nThe player must enter Hell to recover the Amulet. Entering Hell for the uninitiated just means that \"you burn to a crisp\". (In NetHack, Hell is renamed.)\n\nThe player encounters special rooms such as shops, crypts, and vaults. Other spatial elements in the game are traps and swamps. As your experience grows, so are your abilities, score and the need for food.\n\nRetrieving the Amulet doesn't guarantee you the high score. After all the Amulet is just a very valuable gem.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co70d5.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jay Fenlason","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2876,"name":"Cavequest","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Lightwave Consultants","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2877,"name":"Wizard's Crown","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Wizard's Crown is a party-based fantasy role-playing game in the vein of Wizardry and Bard's Tale that was incredibly detailed for its time.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/dkvzhjkku8f8vcwhqbtu.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":2878,"name":"Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Following the defeat of the evil triad in the previous three Ultima games, the world of Sosaria changed beyond recognition: continents rose and sank, and new cities were built, heralding the advent of a different civilization. Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.\n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.\n\nCharacter creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.\n\nThese unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.\n\nUltima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.\n\nThe FM Towns version, while identical to the others in gameplay, introduces upgraded graphics similar to those used in next installment of the series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2cqa.jpg","releaseYear":1985,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Enterprises, Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MicroProse Software, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Origin Systems","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tec Toy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"U.S. Gold","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Pony Canyon","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Newtopia Planning","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fujitsu Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Origin Systems","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"FM-7"}]},{"id":2879,"name":"Telengard","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Telengard is an earlier example of a \"dungeon crawler\" role-playing game--albeit with a top-down view- with either real time movement (DOS version) or turn-based movement and turn based combat.

Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7wp4.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ASCII Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sir-tech Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sir-tech Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X1"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2886,"name":"Starflight","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Starflight is a space exploration role-playing adventure video game developed by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986.

Due to the failure of Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a Nintendo home console.\n\nConceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5tes.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Amusement Vision","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}]},{"id":2928,"name":"Super Monkey Ball 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The objective of Super Monkey Ball 2 is to guide a monkey trapped inside a plastic ball through a maze to the goal.

In challenge mode, you have a limited number of monkeys and a time limit to complete numerous levels of increasing difficulty. In practice mode, you can play any stage already completed in the other two modes.\n\nIn addition to the main game options, numerous party games are also included.

The campaigns are nonlinear, meaning players can accept quests or play the game any way they want. Towns are a focal point in the game and allow players to repair, resupply, and upgrade their ships, pick up new crew members, look for work, or simply listen to rumors. Through trading or combat, players obtain additional ships to build and command an entire fleet. There are 20 types of ships to choose from, ranging from small corvettes to large battleships.\n\nLocation-specific ship damage allows players to send enemies' sails up in flames, bring their masts crashing to the deck, or shoot holes in their decks. Players can customize their ships with a variety of cannon and shot types to create devastating attacks. Wind and weather effects give advantages during combat and determine how ships sail in general. Players can choose to change allegiances at any time, giving up pirate life to join the cause of a country, leaving one country to fight for another, or choosing to serve only oneself as a pirate.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5x92.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bethesda Softworks","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Akella","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":2933,"name":"Kingdom Hearts III","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kingdom Hearts III is the third main installment in the Kingdom Hearts series developed and published by Square Enix.

It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others.

A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities.

Ancient and beautiful, powerful and wise they ruled absolute. Strange beings, magical creatures and humans lived together in peace and harmony, until greed destroyed it all. Ismael, a respected man, and revered by all, sadly had a heart that was hollow and bitter. He and four others plotted to overthrow the Mecubarz.\n\nThe Mecubarz' fury at the treason of Ismael and his men was cataclysmic. They trapped the four seasons and put them into impenetrable crystals, casting them to the four corners of the shattered world where they stood still and were held in an eternal dominion of ice, mist, water, and fire. The four traitors were exiled, but Ismael disappeared.\n\nAs Quickthorpe, an inexperienced adventurer, your quest is to explore the Four Lands of the Mecubarz in search of the mystical gems that will liberate your people. Keen observation, puzzle-solving skill and quick thinking are the abilities required to undertake this exciting but unpredictable task. Interact with a universe of characters which come to life with true speech creating a world with an atmosphere so thick you can feel it. Combined stunning animations and atmospheric sound effects will ensure that Fable will take you on the journey of a lifetime!\n\nBut beware... in the world of Fable not everything is as it seems.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co26iz.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Telstar Electronic Studios Ltd.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simbiosis Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sir-tech Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":2961,"name":"Wisps: The Redeeming","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vdq5rfdhnrexj7zebdti.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jungle Troll Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":2962,"name":"Rusty Stings","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wttzi4rlnrmnhlefy096.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jungle Troll Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":2963,"name":"Dota 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MOBA","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena video game and the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod.
