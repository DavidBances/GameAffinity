It would feature characters seen earlier in the franchise, including Queen Slug-for-a-Butt as an enemy, Peter Puppy as an ally, and Princess What's-Her-Name as a love interest for Jim. Billy the Bin would also make a reappearance as one of the bosses.\n\nBy August 2006, Earthworm Jim PSP was reportedly at 80% complete, and more complete gameplay was shown in Las Vegas. Many video game journalists had hands-on playable builds of the game, such as GameSpot, GamesRadar, and IGN.\n\nEarthworm Jim PSP was initially scheduled for a late 2006 release, but this was pushed back to early 2007. When the time came around, the release was extended again to mid-year 2007. This caused concern for expectant fans, since the game had already been delayed once already.\n\nIn response to this fan concern, Andrew Yoon of PSP Fanboy contacted Alissa Bell from Atari, who confirmed the game had been shelved, commenting: \"I believe EWJ PSP is off the roster. May be revisited in the future, but the title is, as I hear it, on hold.\"\n\nFans were generally excited about the Earthworm Jim revival, which makes it surprising why Atari would stall the project. The complicated transfer of Shiny Entertainment from Interplay to Foundation 9, and merging with The Collective to form Double Helix, may have been a contributing factor in the decision to cancel the game.\n\nAccording to Dave Perry, it was due to both Atari and Interplay's financial difficulties, and a row over royalties between Shiny, Interplay, and Atari.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4042.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":140100,"name":"Honoo no Takuhaibin","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2itv.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":140097,"name":"Antitower","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Chaotic, voice-controlled memory game. \n \nYour rival barged into your home and tampered your elemental grimoire. \n \nMonsters have been summoned and the elemental balance has been broken. \n \nThe elemental laws are rewritten after every fight.

Many things can happen in the room and it's up to the players to decide how far they'll go. Once players are inside the room, a mysterious voice will come in and be mysterious. He will inform the player that they're part of an experiment that revolves around the room. The player will then have to complete several challenges that involve both platforming and puzzle-solving skills. The mysterious voice will then judge the player's performance which will determine what ending the player gets (good, bad, or something in-between). \n \nThe demo for the game is currently available to download on Itch.io.
