Initially this version of the game was exclusively available through a crowdfunding action with a physical release containing a cartridge, but in the spirit of the original game both the game and the source code were eventually made available as a free download afterwards.\n\nThis release improves the original game by correcting a number of map bugs and imperfections. It also adds new colours and tweaks the movement to optimize it and make it more responsive. By completing the game two additional playable characters can be unlocked. Completing it once unlocks Zazelle and a second time Johnny Limite. They each have different moves providing different gameplay.\n\nThe crowdfunded version comes on a cartridge with a box and manual. The cartridges are numbered with a unique serial number. Based on the tier different extras were provided, such as having your name listed in the manual. There is also a tier with a blue cartridge limited to six copies. This tier comes with two bottles of Gik Blue wine.\n\nAlthough not directly confirmed, the CPC version of the game called Sir Ababol: NES-OM Edition listed here is most likely based on this 2017 NES version.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6oux.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"The Mojon Twins","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"1985 Alternativo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The Mojon Twins","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":166926,"name":"VR Meditation SkyRun","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You are welcome to meditate and enjoy the atmosphere of peace and phantastic run of time in a silence high in mountains.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co63hv.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":164401,"name":"Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Australia Civilization & Scenario Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Australia Civilization & Scenario Pack includes the Australian civilization with John Curtin, the Digger unique unit, Outback Station unique improvement, a new Natural Wonder and the new Outback Tycoon scenario.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co85uk.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Firaxis Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":157894,"name":"Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition - Toposim US Southeast","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Toposim US Southeast for FSX: Steam Edition provides LOD 12 / 10m Multi-LOD terrain mesh for the whole of the Southeast of the United States, improving the accuracy of the default terrain mesh and offering a marked improvement to the landscape profile.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co85qb.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Toposim","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Dovetail Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":152441,"name":"Fate/Grand Order: Epic of Remnant","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Fate Grand Order: Epic of Remnant (FGO Project 1.5) is a continuation of Arc 1 in the form of four story chapters before the start of Part 2.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3a59.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"TYPE-MOON","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Delightworks","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":151930,"name":"ADK Damashii","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"PS4 port of PS2 ADK Damashii.\n\nIt includes 5 arcade/Neo Geo games which were all developed by ADK and published by SNK Playmore.

Each map was designed to be played from pistol-start; continuous play is fine but will make the play through much easier. This map set originally started out as a single map contribution to the Vinesauce map contest held in 2016 by Joel \"Vargskelethor\". The map in question (MAP02) was started on in early September, and finished on September 9th. Afterwards, I officially started the project on October 10th (shortly after finishing MAP04).\n\nMy goal with this project was to exercise with the Doom II texture assets, and to create some maps for practice. All maps use stock Doom II textures (aside from skies and minor extras). The maps are medium-to-large in size and have many different paths that you can take. Replayability was a design goal I tried to aim for. Difficulty is somewhat middling, but should ramp up a bit towards the end.\n\nAlso note that you shouldn't use jumping or crouching in these maps. It has been disabled in ZDoom, but some ports will still allow it. If you do use jumping or crouching, you may break the maps.
