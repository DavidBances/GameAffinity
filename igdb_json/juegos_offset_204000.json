The various random NPCs do not communicate, though.\n\nThe dungeon is populated by Greymere's minions; some are randomly placed, others are not, and all must be bested in turn-based combat - the deeper you go, the tougher the bad guys. Fighting involves both melee and ranged attacks, and defeated monsters will bequeath both gold and experience. Leveling up will increase your maximum hit points, but no other stats are tracked.

Each society's gradual expansion eventually led to an historic meeting in a backwater region of space known as the Spinward Marches.\n\nAlthough their human physical appearances were exactly alike, several fundamental differences existed between the two great powers. The Zhodani's political structure was strictly authoritarian, whereas the Imperium was governed by the rule of the Emperor, a classic aristocracy. As the Zhodani race evolved, the human brain's potential was explored and mastered until the use of powerful psionics was a way of life. Mind-reading, telekinesis, extrasensory perception and clairvoyance became common among the Zhodani. The Imperium disdainfully outlawed the use of any form of psionics, believing these strange powers to be an invasion of mental privacy. Also, because the Zhodani utilized their superior mental ability in everyday life, many Imperial traders and merchants grew suspicious of their motives and avoided negotiations with the Zhodani.\nThe Imperial race, lacking psionics, saw its development grow along creative, artistic and emotional paths. And as with any creative society, wondrous achievement and joy was often coupled with imperfections and greed. The Zhodani - viewing the Imperial race as dishonest, morally corrupt, weak and insecure - lived highly structured and unemotional lifestyles. With two powerful societies so clearly opposed in political and social beliefs, confrontation was inevitable.\n\nAs the Zhodani continued to expand into the Spinward Marches, many worlds were peacefully integrated into the Zhodani Consulate. However, several independent worlds resisted the Zhodani, believing that they would lose their freedom and be forced to live under restrictive rule. The Spinward Marches became an intergalactic 'hot spot' and the aggressive advances of the Zhodani led to the first of several conflicts known as the Frontier Wars,the first of which began in 589 - 89 years after the two great powers first established contact.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vepjlv9wahp1op5tny5p.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":12674,"name":"Mad Professor Mariarti","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A puzzle-platformer for home computers.

For each of the four tropical islands, the surface has to be cleared at first by flying around in a side-scrolling perspective, reminiscent of Choplifter. Alien opposition can be destroyed by shooting them, but after six hits the helicopter gets destroyed. \n \nThe basic goal is to destroy a number of robots which are found by using the radar. However, the chopper is not able to destroy those; that's why it carries the Battledroid, a tank. When the chopper lands, the tank is detached and can be driven over the surface of the island. A side effect of destroying the robots is the rescue of human scientists which are held hostage in said robots. They can be picked up with the helicopter and brought to the base. While this is not required to finish the level, rescued scientists net vital upgrades like better weapons, a better shield or the ability to move underwater. All those upgrades can be either applied to the chopper or the tank. \n \nAfter all robots are destroyed, a volcano opens up and the player moves right in. In the following section the game transforms into a vertically scrolling shooter. Gameplay in these sections is traditional, save for the fact that the player travels downwards from the upper part of the screen: dodging enemy bullets and shooting as many aliens as possible until the level end boss is reached and defeated.
