So regardless of having a \"good lock on the target\" there is a good chance the missile will miss. Just like the real accounts from the war suggest most of the dogfights are close in affairs with the nimble MiGs against the heavier less nimble US Aircraft.\n\nThe map of Vietnam has been scaled down slightly so that there is less time spent flying to a target, and also because air-to-air refuelling is not included in the game.\n\nDuring a mission the player will fly in a flight of aircraft in which the computer-controlled planes keep in formation as you fly to a target. This flight can be issued commands; attack other aircraft or ground targets, fly home if they are damaged, or jettison their drop tanks. As you fly many other computer-controlled aircraft will be up in the air and can be viewed as they engage in dogfights or bomb targets.\n\nTrue to the Vietnam theatre the player's aircraft will be met with a high level of radar guided Surface to Air Missiles (SAMS), and a variety of lethal Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). The main SAM is the soviet SA-2, of which early and later versions are included in the game increasing lethality accordingly.\n\nThe player can select a campaign from either Operation Rolling Thunder (1965 to 1968), Linebacker I (1972) or Linebacker II (1972) which are similar in name and aircraft involved to the actual campaigns from the conflict.\n\nSingle Missions are also available, which can be customised to allow the player to practice with specific aircraft and weapons.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ufwpnobnvtnpnnevjo5h.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":16131,"name":"Mortal Kombat X: Kombat Pack 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2klb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":15923,"name":"Cybercon","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":15922,"name":"Cybercon II","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":15920,"name":"CrossCheck","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/atortjffkvyu10sohpka.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":15919,"name":"Count Duckula 2: Featuring Tremendous Terence","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Count Duckula's arch enemy Von Goosewing has fixed a rocket to one of the castle turrets, blasting the vegetarian Vampire and his cronies into outer space.\n\nDuckula though, thinks the motion of the turret is a side effect of drinking Nanny's potion (understandable really), but he soon realizes their true predicament when they hit an asteroid field.\n\nFortunately Tremendous Terence, Count Duckula's hero comes to the rescue, knocking their 'turret spacecraft' on to a nearby planet surface.\n\nOh dear though it's the planet Cute- Yuk!
