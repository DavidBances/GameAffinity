It has a revolutionary and new combo system based on \"cancelling\", which allows us to link special movements within others, thus being able to perform a very high number of hits. The game is also designed so that its difficulty decreases considerably as we learn and run this system, so the learning curve is steep. In other words, the game will reward us as we learn to deal maximum damage to enemies.\n\nThe roster of playable characters consists of 120 (114 + 4 hidden + 2 super hidden) characters, combining fighters from several of Capcom's most successful sagas such as: Final Fight, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter III, Street Fighter IV, Street Fighter Alpha, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Captain Commando, Alien vs Predator, Battle Circuit, Punisher, Knights of the Round, Warriors of Fate, Marvel vs Capcom and Capcom vs SNK. Despite the wide repertoire, each character is balanced and arranged so that the playable experience is optimal, we choose the character we choose and we have chances to finish the game without continuing with any of the 120 characters and in any of the game modes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5zlr.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"LNS","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":226996,"name":"Planet Zoo: Arctic Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Join Bernie Goodwin on an epic Arctic adventure and explore new challenges, animals, and more!
