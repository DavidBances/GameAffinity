This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual.\n\nAdditionally, the 'vigor' meter in Project Justice is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in Rival Schools), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level.\n\nAlso carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of Project Justice in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in Project Justice is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in Rival Schools. As with School Life Mode in the original Rival Schools, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of Project Justice due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub-characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8iy0.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Capcom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":308294,"name":"Asylum","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Duke must somehow escape from the asylum, locate the nearby\ninvisible building, and get the alien infestation out of the research center for good!","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":300672,"name":"Coven of Ebony","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Blue medieval episode with 4 levels (+start/end map), some new monsters and fairly tough gameplay.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co871y.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":228581,"name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo: 10-nenme no Shoutaijou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5vca.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Banpresto","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":51331,"name":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Sports Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The TV show of 2000 continues with this PC title, dedicated to Sports.

Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two modes: Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online.\n\nThe meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000, enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races: Standard, Trial and Vendetta.\n\nStandard races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one: breaking speed limits at certain points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash flow. Trial races involve wagering: a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options. These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner taking the loser's car.\n\nThe game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks in 12 configurations), adds a \"Heavy Winter\" configuration to the Canada track and adds one new track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable.

The higher the number of times the ball bounces on his side of the court before he returns it, the more damage is done to his health bar.\n\nYou can also collect & use power-ups that turn the ball into a bomb or a plasma weapon to hurt your opponent. Other power-ups available include ones that temporarily increase your running speed, give you the ability to steal a power-up from your opponent or give you a shield.\n\nFinally, if you hold down the swipe button long enough your character will launch a special attack at the other side of the court. However, while you're building up this attack you can't hit the ball.\n\nPlayers can refill their health bar by eating fruit & candy that appears on the court during gameplay. The first player to win the required number of rounds (1, 3, 5 or 7) wins the match.\n\nIn the single-player story-mode you start with only one character and collect 19 other characters by beating them in the 3 available episodes.

Players not only control the combat units (ranging from infantry and tanks to helicopters, fighters and bombers, armored trains, surface warships and submarines, stationary gun turrets), but (especially in the later games) also many support logistics units (ammo and fuel transports, scout and radar units, road and construction vehicles, and others). Units have various weapons and can gain experience (which in later games can be transferred over in a campaign). Fuel and ammo is limited, and logistics require careful attention. Players also control buildings, where units can be repaired, and sometimes, produced. Weather conditions change, affecting unit movements (for example, a sea or river can freeze, immobilizing ships but allowing light units to move through it). Fog of war is prevalent and players have to use scouting units to gain information about the battlefield. Some of those options were added in expansions or sequels. \n \nPlayers have various tasks, ranging from eliminating all opponent forces to capturing specific buildings or protecting certain units or places. In some missions events from outside the battlefield can suddenly change the situation, giving players new objectives, reinforcements, allies or enemies. In some battles there are more than two sides, each with their own objectives, not all of them directly involved in hostilities - some of them can be even allied. At the same time, those allegiances can change because of some events or actions. \n \nBattle Isle one had the screen divided into two parts, one for each player. The turns were also divided into move and attack phases. While one player moved his units, the other commanded his own troops to carry out his actions. Battle Isle 2 gave the player the entire screen, and merged move and attack phases, and introduced the 3-D display of combat. Battle Isle 3 was very similar to Battle Isle 2, with improved graphics, more units and a new storyline. Battle Isle: The Andosian War was entirely set in the 3-D environment and combined elements of real-time and turn-based strategies. \n \nThe AI is relatively weak, relying on mass frontal assaults. After a player survives the first few turns and the AI's overwhelming numbers using protected artillery and terrain advantage, the computer is usually unable to mount a proper defense.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":49986,"name":"Tweety's High-Flying Adventure","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Are you ready to knock out some bad 'ol puttytats?

The campaigns are nonlinear, meaning players can accept quests or play the game any way they want. Towns are a focal point in the game and allow players to repair, resupply, and upgrade their ships, pick up new crew members, look for work, or simply listen to rumors. Through trading or combat, players obtain additional ships to build and command an entire fleet. There are 20 types of ships to choose from, ranging from small corvettes to large battleships.\n\nLocation-specific ship damage allows players to send enemies' sails up in flames, bring their masts crashing to the deck, or shoot holes in their decks. Players can customize their ships with a variety of cannon and shot types to create devastating attacks. Wind and weather effects give advantages during combat and determine how ships sail in general. Players can choose to change allegiances at any time, giving up pirate life to join the cause of a country, leaving one country to fight for another, or choosing to serve only oneself as a pirate.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5x92.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Akella","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bethesda Softworks","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":282640,"name":"Soreike!
