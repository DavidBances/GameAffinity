Contestants were given 24 hours to create a level based around the contents of a virtual mystery box, filled with a random selection of 2 enemies and 2 gimmicks from the official Mega Man games. There was no guarantee that any of these assets would make sense or work well together, so it was up to the contestants to make the most of what they had been given.\n\nDespite some rough edges owing to the time constraint, the levels are on par with anything you'd find in any other MaGMML game. However, the game itself is very short and extremely light on bonus features; there's no hub world to explore or extensive postgame content to delve into. 24H is less a traditional MaGMML and more a proof of concept for Make a Good 48 Hour Mega Man Level, so please set your expectations accordingly for maximum enjoyment.\n\n24H has no story or cutscenes of any kind, but the game technically takes place at the same time as Episode Zero, with the premise being that Mega Man is testing the simulation technology used in MaGMML2.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co80sv.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":209236,"name":"Make a Good 48 Hour Mega Man Level","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"After all the work he's been doing for so many years, Mega Man is finally taking a well-deserved vacation.

Levels were evaluated and ranked by a panel of 4 judges, and an elaborate game was built around the results. Unlike the main MaGMMLs, participants were not allowed to program custom objects for their levels - but that doesn't mean this game isn't just as wacky and innovative as previous ones.\n\n48H is a spiritual successor to Make a Good 24 Hour Mega Man Level that takes place between MaGMML2 and MaGMML3, but no previous MaGMML knowledge is necessary to enjoy the story.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co80sm.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":209237,"name":"Versus Tactics","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Versus Tactics is a 1v1 turn-based competitive battle game inspired by the classic Final Fantasy Tactics.

The game offers the Beginners' Class and Expert Class difficulties. The player takes control of a training biplane, but will get the opportunity to fly better and bigger aircraft through progression. The gameplay shows a realistic console of aircraft controls and a 3D landscape, in which the plane takes off, flies around and lands. The player must follow take off, flying and landing procedures to achieve as many points as possible, but can lose the game if an accident happens.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6erf.jpg","releaseYear":1996,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":209261,"name":"Le Mans 24","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Le Mans 24 (ル・マン 24) is a Sega Model 3 arcade game by Sega, based on the real life endurance race of the same name and licensed by its organisers, Automobile Club de l'Ouest. It is unrelated to Le Mans 24 Hours for the Sega Dreamcast.\n\nLe Mans 24 is unique among Sega racing games in that the races occur in real-time, with 24 in-game hours equivalent to roughly 10 minutes. Players have a limited amount of time to complete the 24 hour race and can earn extra time by passing other cars or completing a lap of the track. Likewise, being passed by another car subtracts time from the timer. If the timer runs out, the race continues even if there are no players. The player can choose to insert another credit and continue where s/he left off. Up to 3 twin cabinets can be linked to allow 6 player competition.\n\nLe Mans 24 is much more realistic than other racing games of its era, with periods of rain affecting how the cars handle, simulated tire wear, and a day/night cycle.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4z2p.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega AM3","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":209262,"name":"Mega Man: Day in the Limelight 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Mega Man: Day in the Limelight 2 is the second game in a fangame trilogy based on the 8-bit series of games, and created by Riverroad.\n\nStory-wise, Mega Man has either disappeared or become unable to beat Dr. Wily, and it's up to past Robot Masters to save the day.\n\nWhile the basics function much the same way as traditional Mega Man games, each character has different attributes, from movement to attack patterns and even special abilities!\n\nThe idea was novel enough to warrant further sequels, improving on the formula.

The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.\n\nHis objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.\n\nAs the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero's Handbook\" and Harry's off to adventure. The \"Hero's Handbook's\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co87vu.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Torus Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Endgame Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nikko","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":0,"name":"Digiblast"}]},{"id":209389,"name":"Bebder Game: Bebder Than the Rest","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The number 1 Anti-Wendy's RPG game in the world.
