While the basic gameplay is identical in design, controlling with a gamepad instead of the touch-screen & Stylus pair makes it a different game. It consists of a board where coloured meteos plummet towards a planet's atmosphere. There, they form columns that the user can manipulate. The player moves a red cursor with two buttons to slide the meteos up or down. When three or more are lined up horizontally or vertically, they turn into ignited stone and are launched into space (the top of the screen) boosted by rockets. There they also catch all incoming meteos and often chain combos together. Ignitions based on vertical matches provide a more powerful ignition. As a group catches more incoming meteos, it becomes heavier and gravity pulls it down. The player can avoid that by causing secondary ignitions, either directly in the group or from below. If meteos can be lifted past the top of the screen, they fall down into the opponent's board. The game is over when a player's board is filled up entirely.\n\nAn additional button can be used to speed up time, creating time bombs to be sent into the opponent's board to cause an explosion. Meteos can also turn into ash and drop back down. When there is a full gauge at the bottom of the screen a planet impact can be caused. There are four types (Armageddon, Gambit, Sentinel and Tempest) each with different effects. Respectively, they lower the attack power, send more meteos while receiving less, fire a meteos missile, and fire lasers to clear away falling meteos as an additional means of defense.\n\nThe single-player has three game modes: a versus battle against the computer, mission mode, and attack mode. In the mission mode different planets need to be defeated before reaching Meteo. It is possible to unlock new planets and accessories along the way. Multiplayer against a human player is available both offline and online.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2kfn.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":21705,"name":"PowerUp Forever","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An endless dual stick shooter in which you power-up forever!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lf8owxfibavwppd8qq2z.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":280707,"name":"Paul Blart: Mall Cop - Mall Maze","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A short Pac-Man clone made to promote the first Paul Blart movie.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7j6s.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Online Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":77095,"name":"Strategery","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Turn-based world domination strategy game for the iPhone.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/tohuhmvruvf4eywlb2q5.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":51630,"name":"Shootanto: Evolutionary Mayhem","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Shootanto: Evolutionary Mayhem, players start as primates and battle lizardmen across the epochs, from primeval to medieval times and beyond.

He can also hold his breath for a short time to steady his aim.\n\nIn the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence the athlethe's capabilities.

In order to increase their own fortunes, they can either ally with a syndicate to create a trade empire, or cut their own path through Faerun by preying upon caravans and selling the goods on the black market. As they attempt to extend their influence, players will become aware of a new\nfaction working behind the scenes: the evil, shape-shifting, serpentine Yuan-Ti.\n\nIn addition to trading and economic manipulation, the Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir Overland Map allows players to explore the Chultan Peninsula and Sword Coast in a non-linear manner never before seen in any of the\nNeverwinter Nights games.

Groups of highwaymen and monsters populate the Overland Map and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become.\n\nThe 15-hour campaign in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir is also packed with new classes, spells, creatures, and playable races.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1sye.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Obsidian Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Infogrames Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1163,"name":"Tomb Raider: Underworld","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tomb Raider: Underworld represents a new advancement in exploration-based gameplay.

However, unlike many other games, such as Puzzle Bobble, where the goal is to eliminate objects of certain colors or shapes, Cubello continues to provide the player with cubes colors that are either still in the magazine or on the stage, so the player has to calculate to have the color disappear from the magazine and the stage at the same time to win.
