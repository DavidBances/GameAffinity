Both players have a health bar similar to the ones used in fighting games. The objective of the game is not to score points to win games & sets, but to deplete the health bar of your opponent. This can be done in several ways:* First you can try to play the ball past your opponent. The higher the number of times the ball bounces on his side of the court before he returns it, the more damage is done to his health bar.\n\nYou can also collect & use power-ups that turn the ball into a bomb or a plasma weapon to hurt your opponent. Other power-ups available include ones that temporarily increase your running speed, give you the ability to steal a power-up from your opponent or give you a shield.\n\nFinally, if you hold down the swipe button long enough your character will launch a special attack at the other side of the court. However, while you're building up this attack you can't hit the ball.\n\nPlayers can refill their health bar by eating fruit & candy that appears on the court during gameplay. The first player to win the required number of rounds (1, 3, 5 or 7) wins the match.\n\nIn the single-player story-mode you start with only one character and collect 19 other characters by beating them in the 3 available episodes. Unlocked characters can then be used in exhibition games. The 3 episodes take place on a pirate-themed galleon court, a horror-themed graveyard court and a Christmas-themed wonderland court.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6q82.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Freeloader","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":54427,"name":"Terminal Machine","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":54428,"name":"Terra Farmers","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":54430,"name":"Terrorist Takedown: Payback","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Terrorist Takedown: Payback is the sequel to Terrorist Takedown.

Although the Battle of the Bulge is ground that has been visited by wargamers before, it has never been done with this level of fidelity and historical accuracy. The most advanced and realistic model of command decision-making implemented to date in a commercial wargame, combined with thorough historical research on the battlefields and forces involved in this campaign sets Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge apart from the competition. \n \nSet during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge, Command Ops lets gamers assess, plan, order and react at the operational level just like a real Corps, Division and Brigade commander. Hundreds of hours of gameplay await armchair generals who will be challenged to fight their way across 27 scenarios that stretch from the initial German surprise offensive to the powerful Allied counter-attack. \n \nCommand Ops: Battles from the Bulge also sports some of the most advanced and impressive AI ever devised in an operational-level wargame! It is your choice whether to manage every detail of your army, or have the friendly AI manage the war on a lower level while you plan the larger scale maneuvers designed to make short work of your enemy. Just as a historical commander, you can choose where you need to step in and when you need to stand back and let your subordinates do their jobs. \n \nThe enemy AI will use its skill to launch well-timed and coordinated strikes as it probes your lines for weakness while realistically reacting to your movements! In addition, for the enthusiastic mod community awaiting Command Ops, powerful tools like MapMaker and ScenMaker allow for the creation of maps and scenarios further adding to already near limitless replayability.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/g08bkbpwvwljmtmm1x9q.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Matrix Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Panther Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":54654,"name":"Battle of the Bulge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jwzfn1j8mf3hgklcv0kv.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":54655,"name":"Fire Power","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Firepower is a top-down action game developed by Silent Software and released for various systems in 1988.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ios.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Silent Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"MicroIllusions","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple IIGS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":54656,"name":"Chicken Wiggle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"From the team behind Mutant Mudds and Xeodrifter comes a new 2D platformer starring a chicken and a worm for Nintendo 3DS and iOS.
