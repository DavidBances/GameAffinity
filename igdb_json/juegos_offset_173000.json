Use the left and right joystick or directional pad to aim the beam, and press the action button to fire a bubble.\n\nThe game can be increased in difficulty through the addition of multiple Puffer fish and by potentially removing the players aiming beam.\n\nJungle Jump\nJungle jump is a game of timing and skill. Use the left and right buttons on the joystick or directional pad to guide the Monkey through increasingly difficult jungle levels.\n\nShell Game\nThe shell game is both a game of skill and observation coupled with a way to win more Sand Dollars. Conceptually the Shell Game is extremely simple: three shells that swap, the user must pick the shell that hides the pearl.\n\nDue to the high expense of certain shop items and the cost of purchasing new islands, the user can use the Shell Game to win the Sand Dollars required to make these large purchases.\n\nSandoku\nThe classic favorite Sudoku makes the transition to Tropix effectively, with intuitive play.\n\nCascade\nCascade is a casual concept. The game is a variation on the classic objective of connecting three of a kind. This type of game can be controlled exclusively via the joystick or directional pad with the addition of the action button to make selections.\n\nThe overall design is about linking these mini-games into a \"world\" where you buy things, look after a creature, travel around and explore.

The game marked Team17's return to its 2D roots.[2] The game spawned a sequel, Worms: Open Warfare 2, which is also available on Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.\n\nIn Worms: Open Warfare, the player takes control of an army of worms. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing army through reducing the health points of enemy worms using various types of weaponry while avoiding friendly fire and other obstacles. The weapons and gadgets you use in battle include grenades, homing missiles, bazookas, cluster bombs, banana bombs (a Worms staple), dynamite, air strikes, shotguns, and many more. You can also choose from a variety of settings to battle in and make your own schemes and teams.\nThe game is played in rounds with each worm starting with 100 hit points. Each team takes turns controlling one of their worms. The player is usually allocated 60 seconds per turn to move their worm around the battlefield and attack the opponent worms, though this time limit is customisable when playing non-career games. Only one attack is allowed per turn.\nIn addition to timing individual player turns, each round has a 20-minute time limit. If the round timer runs down to 0:00 before a team claims victory, every worm's HP drops to 1, creating a sudden death scenario. During the course of a round, crates containing health or weapons will occasionally drop and the water level will rise.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1xme.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Team17","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":17243,"name":"Keepsake","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Point-and click adventure exploration puzzle game set in a magical academy.

In my opinion, games like these are just not fun. How can you enjoy a game if you have to keep saving after each major jump? I don’t think you can.\n\nThat is why SMBHF’s levels are about as difficult as the original game’s. You will NOT find ultra-hard levels in SMBHF; if you can beat Super Mario Bros, you can beat SMBHF. These levels were created for the gamer’s enjoyment, not for the gamer’s frustration. Each level (1-1 through 8-4) has been changed. Some have been changed moreso than others, but each has been significantly altered.\n\nThe lesser focus of SMBHF is graphic changing. Some major graphic changes include: New floor tile, New underwater tile, New “?” blocks, New brick graphics (Borrowed from SMB2J), and others.

You can simply buy equipment by using the Y button on your controller in conjunction with the left thumbstick button to select an item to buy.\n\nAs such, the game developers call The Outfit \"destruction on demand\". The equipment you buy with Field Units will initially be occupied by AI-controlled soldiers, but you can replace whoever is using the equipment so that you can have some fun blowing stuff up. Sporting a fully destructible environment, almost everything in The Outfit can be blown up.\n\nYou can play as one of three characters. Tommy Mac can take lots of damage before dying, and comes equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, but equipment will cost him more Field Units than other characters. Deuce Williams comes equipped with a rocket launcher and pistol, and doesn't need as much Field Units to buy stuff as Tommy does, but he isn't nearly as strong as Tommy. JD Tyler is the most accurate of the three, sporting a sniper rifle and shotgun, but unfortunately he will die with one shot, so he must take an extremely tactical approach to gameplay.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4eip.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Relic Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":146986,"name":"Helherron","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Helherron is an old-school freeware fantasy role playing game.

Scratches is the first commercial adventure game ever to be made in Argentina.\n\nThe game tells the story of the Blackwood estate on the outskirts of Rothbury, a small rural town in Northumberland, England in 1976.\n\nOriginally owned by James T. Blackwood in 1963, the house is passed to Christopher Milton after Mr. Blackwood is accused of murdering his wife. A couple of days later, Mr. Blackwood dies of a sudden heart attack though some in the town start rumors that he might have committed suicide. The police decide to close the case seeing there is no further evidence left. Shortly after acquiring the house, Milton inexplicably disappears in 1970 leaving no visible trace.\n\nThe player assumes the role of the house's next inhabitant, Michael Arthate, an author seeking seclusion to work on his next book. He moves in only to find that the house still echoes its horrible past quite literally as scratches are heard all around, particularly in the basement and fireplaces, and soon becomes more interested in researching the house's history than his writing.\n\nScratches uses a first person perspective to navigate around the house. Using only a mouse, the player can access various rooms and other places in order to solve the mystery of both Blackwood and Milton's disappearances. It features music and special sound effects by the now defunct Cellar of Rats, which contribute to the fearsome ambience experienced at the mansion, crypt, greenhouse and church.\n\nThe game is heavily influenced by the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and several direct references to Lovecraft works make their appearances in Scratches. There are in-game references to the Necronomicon, De Vermis Mysteriis, Lovecraft's story \"The Mountains of Madness,\" as well as one critics of Michael's book being called R'yleh. Michael states in the game he had just moved to Rothbury from Providence, Rhode Island-the hometown of Lovecraft.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4o8x.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Got Game Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nucleosys","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":209633,"name":"Sift Heads","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A stickman sniper game where the objective to eliminate the enemies and complete the objectives in each level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4zea.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Pyrozen","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":54210,"name":"Winguel","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Winguel is a game pack with five different games and extra material for your fun.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6t68.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Espaço Informática","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"IncaGold","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":2567,"name":"Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The wildly popular Dragon Ball Z series makes its first appearance on the PlayStation Portable with Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai.

The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly.

Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties.

It includes a new level cap of 70 for adventurers and artisans, new items and quests, new monsters to fight, alternate ways of advancing your character (achievement points) and the ability to increase a guild to level 50. \n \nPurchase of the expansion granted each character in any account that bought the expansion an Aviak hatchling. If the expansion was bought in a brick and mortar store, the account is granted one Carnivorous plant. The Carnivorous Plant acts as a house pet which can be fed items from the world, and depending on what is fed to it, will yield a useful item. \n \nThe Overrealm is composed of floating islands which originate from the Plane of Sky. Transportation to the Overrealm works like in The Shadows of Luclin; when a player wishes to go there, he or she obtains a teleportation shard from the overseer of a wizard spire on the ground. The overseer NPC then grants to the player character a teleportation shard which flags the player as one wanting to go to the Overrealm. Every five minutes, the spires activate, sending player characters to the Overrealm. If a player originates in Antonica or the Commonlands, he or she will be sent to the Tenebrous Tangle. If a player originates in the Thundering Steppes or Nektulos Forest, then he or she is sent to the Barren Sky. If the player originates in the Enchanted Lands or the Feerrott, he or she is sent to the Bonemire. \n \nAs with both the original game and the first expansion, a new epic quest line is included called the \"Claymore\" line. The start of this quest line can be completed solo in the outdoor areas, however, it will soon require a group and many segments require large investments of time \"camping\" the required NPCs to spawn and gain quest updates. The last parts of this quest must be completed within a raid (a group of 7+ players), the first being in an area known as \"Ascent of the Awakened\" in which you must have two groups (12 players). The final part takes place in Deathtoll, a zone intended for four groups (24 players), and requires an epic access quest in itself to enter. In the end players got to choose from an archetype specific reward (in some cases there are multiple choices) which at the current time was some of the (arguably) best items in the game. \n \nOnce a player has installed this expansion pack and reaches adventuring level 10, a character is granted achievement experience through discovering new areas, finding precious treasure and status items, killing monsters with specific names, completing select quests, and completing certain collections of items.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/uojm9bi2fulrcdhsp1cs.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sony Online Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":9439,"name":"Tycoon City: New York","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Here's your chance to make it big in the Big Apple...

Gems can be attached and detached from armor and weapons that have special gem slots.\n\nAlong with the various species of monster returning from the first Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter 2 contains many new monsters, such as the metallic wind dragon Kushala Daora, the lion-headed dragon Teo Teskatoru (named Teostra in the North American and PAL versions of Monster Hunter Freedom 2) and his female counterpart Nana Teskatory (named Lunastra in the North American and PAL versions of MHF2), the primates Babakonga and Dodobrango (Congalala and Blangonga in MHF2), the bull or minotaur-like monster Rajang, and the chameleon-like dragon Oonazuchi (Chameleos in MHF2). With new monsters also comes the prospect of new weapons and armor.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co56p6.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Capcom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":4629,"name":"7 Wonders of the Ancient World","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Players take the task of reconstructing the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World.
