Battles are a mix of turn-based strategy puzzles on a set map with enemies that can move about, random item nodes and heliports/command nodes, from which the player can summon their own echelons, or support echelons, which are echelons that the player's friend sets on their profile to be used by others, and real-time battles with enemy echelons. Battles are for the most part automated, although the player can activate the T-Dolls' special abilities manually if wanted, or order them to different spots in formation (which the player can organise out of battle to be set as the default formation when entering a battle) or to withdraw in order to conserve health or resources). Players also have the option of withdrawing specific echelons from the mission altogether if they wish. Gameplay progresses by playing on the campaign missions, logistic support missions, or combat simulations to level up each T-Doll. The game also features gacha elements, such as in the production and heavy production of T-Dolls and equipment, or in the Dormitory with costumes and furniture sets for the T-Dolls on a time-limited basis with several sets and costumes being available for a limited time, before another few sets and costumes are revealed and added. After a while, old costumes from previous gacha events will be added to the \"Black Card\" store, where players can exchange an amount of Black Cards (obtained from gifting T-Dolls a duplicate costume that has already been gifted before) for a costume of a previous gacha set. Players can customise their dorms with furniture, and interact with Chibi renditions of the T-Dolls in the echelon corresponding with that dorm.

The player is presented with a vertical playfield that consists of pins and other kinds of obstacles. The player drops coins from the top of the screen by tapping the screen. These will then bounce around until they reach one of five buckets at the bottom. Each level has a number of bad pennies and to move on to the next, the player has to hit all of them. The game is played with the touchscreen and the player simply taps where he wants the coins to drop. Up to five coins can be dropped at once. By hitting all buckets the player gets a coin frenzy. This means that five bonus coins automatically gets dropped. Each level has a number of pins that the player gets points for hitting. They then change color and when all pins have changed colour, the points awarded goes up. Some levels have girl coins that have to be rescued. This is often done by destroying Breakout-like bricks so that the coins can fall down to the bottom.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3glu.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Full Fat","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":58197,"name":"Flick Rugby 16","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A rugby game from Full Fat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/demy4mvi7tiey7h7akp3.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":58198,"name":"Blocky Rugby","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A rugby runner game from Full Fat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/fkivbtlo2xi70dh3hq8c.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":58199,"name":"Palitron","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A isometric action-adventure game written by Charles Goodwin and published by The Edge for the Amstrad CPC.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pji96fruqsnconivq71b.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":58200,"name":"Magic MixUp","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A match-3 game from Full Fat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/f4elbrqukuqtqkcp4b1x.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":58201,"name":"Flick Golf!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Flick your balls to sink a perfect hole-in-one!

In your quest to find your people, you’ll set off on a galactic adventure where you’ll meet a host of colorful characters and visit unimaginable locations.\n\nOut There Chronicles is a unique adventure set several million years before Out There. Where do the Arks come from? What are the Cubes? Fans of the original game will find answers to some questions, but others will remain a mystery.\nYou’ll also meet various alien races and get the opportunity to learn more about their people… If you can master their language, of course.\n\nIn this universe that is so far from your own in distance and in time, a sharp mind and an instinct for survival are your only weapons. Friendships can be forged and ancient rivalries re-emerge through your encounters with almost-human and less-human races. Will you be able to distinguish friend from foe?\nAs in the original game, a single human is unable to face the forces of the universe alone. Achieve your goals by exercising diplomacy when needed, and seizing opportunities when they present themselves.\n\nWritten by FibreTigre, author of the original game, Out There Chronicles offers an epic story that will delight science fiction fans in search of new experiences.\nBrilliantly illustrated by top French SF artist, Benjamin Carré, and equipped with a simple interface, Out There Chronicles will take you on a journey of adventure, even if you’ve never played a video game before.\n\nFeatures :\n• 80 achievements\n• An interactive sci-fi graphic novel written by FibreTigre (Out There)\n• A complex dialogue system: your choices can have consequences later in the adventure\n• Master the alien language and discover their cultures\n• Stunning, varied environments\n• Develop relationships with an array of complex characters\n• Revelations on the Out There universe\n• A dead simple, accessible interface\n• Magnificent illustrations by Benjamin Carré, the French master of science fiction\n• Captivating music composed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn (Antichamber, Out There…)","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/pnmvyb8k4udv9m8qep4p.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":58225,"name":"Kyub","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kyub is an action puzzle game by Ninja Egg.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/g7p78s43vbncb31p64jk.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"NextNinja","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":58226,"name":"Lexit","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A word game from MEA Mobile.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bag3ldnwlphj2fex4tiu.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":58227,"name":"Lexual","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A word game from Synoptical Studios.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hnw0zueflveo8bn8hkoi.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":58228,"name":"The Amazing Fantastics","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Amazing Fantastics is a turn-based RPG saga that puts the player in the shoes of a hero who must assemble a team of super-powered allies to protect one of the most dangerous cities in the country.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co431e.jpg","releaseYear":2020,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":58229,"name":"Oh, My Word!
