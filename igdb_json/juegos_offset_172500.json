As a professional investigator, you'll also need to put the case together, connecting the dots and discovering who the culprits were.\n\nChoose which technology you want to take on each case. Do you want to hunt down the revenant and trap it? Or set up surveillance and sensors so you can stay away from it. Either way, you'll always have your trusty tablet at your side, allowing you to picture any evidence you find and keep demonic forces at bay.\n\nThis is no regular camera, the Pentacam was built using ancient ritual magics. The demons should be afraid of you as you charge up the Pentacam and manifest them further with each shot. Until they are eventually captured within the device.\n\nRevenants will be released in an episodic / case structure. With the base game containing the first case, and the next cases being released as they are developed as DLC.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4bej.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Windows Mixed Reality"},{"id":0,"name":"SteamVR"}]},{"id":186224,"name":"OlliOlli World: Rad Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"OlliOlli World Rad Edition includes:\n• OlliOlli World\n• First story expansion \"Void Riders\" containing an entirely new biome, levels, characters, gameplay and customization unlocks.

The premise is that the angry video game nerd is playing a bad NES game - starring himself! The game features original commentary by AVGN creator James Rolfe, commenting on the game action as you play.\n\nThe game consists of eight themed levels with their own bizarre enemies and hazards, each one ending with a boss battle. The fourth and eight stages differ from the rest by instead being scrolling shoot 'em up rather than the regular platforming gameplay.\n\nThe nerd has an infinite supply of empty beer bottles which can be thrown either forward or in an upwards arc. You can also roll by pressing down, even while jumping, which makes you a smaller target but you can't shoot while rolling. Defeated enemies will sometimes drop exclamation mark items which refills some health, or even more rarely an extra life item. Dying will send you back to the last checkpoint.

It’s a platformer that has your character jumping, punching and cursing every time he scrapes his knee.\n\nOn the fence between being amusing and downright inappropriate\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint, AVGN: Game Over can’t be argued with because it is a fan-made game that aims to be anything but serious, but seriously offensive. It uses a retro look with old’school gameplay that work well together and with the rest of the game concept.\n\nIn every level you’ll be punching goombas, Kirbys and a whole lot of characters from popular platformers and not only. In the standalone games, some of the future punching bags are evil characters, others are heroes but in AVGN: Game Over they are all categorically victims.\n\nThe game pushes forward a sense of useless violence that is backed up by a good deal of verbal abuse that just isn’t right. At times cursing a bit can be funny but I’m not sure that this game has that thought in mind.\nDrop the F bomb, literally\n\nThe game is meant to reflect The Angry Video Game Nerd who has made a name for himself for openly bashing games that he considered to be bad. Presentation was everything and that’s also obvious in the game. There is a lot of cursing and to recharge his life essence, he drinks beer just like in real life.\n\nAs a game, AVGN: Game Over is...something. Having repetitive gameplay is an understatement because you can finish the game just by using a single move and the constant ‘F***’ shouts get annoying after a while.\nIf you’re the kind who easily gets frustrated, don’t play this\n\nTo wrap it up, AVGN: Game Over is not something worth recommending. As a game, it’s barely decent and its ‘charm’ solely revolves around the use of trash-talk and downright indecent language.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4bjy.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"LordGavinGames","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":186376,"name":"The Angry Video Game Nerd: Game Over 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This is an old game of mine that I felt like sharing here.
