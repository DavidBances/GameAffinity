But in the reclusive village of Homaran, a tentative peace is sustained amongst its people.\n\nEir lives simply with her father; her life plain but fulfilling. Until he is brutally murdered at the hands of the Caelki, a dark sect who live in service to disorder and the worship of an insatiable god, long since forgotten to legend, much like the origins of the crystals Eathral has come to so desperately rely on.\n\nWith her closest companion and unrequited inamorata, Kira at her heel and a mysterious book written in a language she does not understand, Eir sets out on a quest to find answers that will reshape her destiny and change everything she knows about who she thought she was. Taking refuge in the hands of her allies and a planetary ancestral power that roots itself deeper within her than even she knows, Eir must learn to wield the might of Eathral herself in this tale of magical discovery, devotion, betrayal, and adventure.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7kvb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":123661,"name":"Get Rich or Die 2","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123659,"name":"NuTokyo 2199","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123658,"name":"Winning Post 5","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123653,"name":"Feudal Lords","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123650,"name":"Forebearers: Hearth & Home","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123649,"name":"Gods of the Arena","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2q92.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123648,"name":"Ignis: Duels of Wizards","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2qe9.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123645,"name":"Warzone","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123643,"name":"My Brother the Sacrifice","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A short, top-down game where you'll try to save your brother from the Goddess of Death and her cult of followers.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":123642,"name":"Master of the Wind","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":123640,"name":"Whirled","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Whirled is a virtual world website and video game created by Three Rings Design.

It pushes to make all content user-created, mainly with its approach to creative accessibility using Flash's affinity for 2D vector graphics and various web compatibilities to make it very simple for players to upload a wide variety of content using simple, conventional file formats.\n\nUpon Grey Havens releasing the source code for Whirled under their BSD License, several mirror sites formed.
