To finish a level, the player must find the \"Element of Harmony\"; after each level follows a boss fight with one of the villains from the show. The player has a limited amount of health and lives, but life and health bonuses can be found.\n\nThere are six pony characters in total to choose from. Initially only one character is available, and a new pony is unlocked when the player finishes all six levels. The ponies have different abilities - e.g. Twilight Sparkle can shoot laser beams and use teleport pads, while Applejack can climb ladders and kick.

You-Know-Which series - further enhanced with strategy and RPG elements. The core of the gameplay is based on ship-to-ship dogfights, combined with assaults on giant spaceships (such as the Siegfried-Class Zeppelins), as well as tactical thinking and resource management.\n\nThe game is set in outer space, where the players must defend the Earth from the invasion of the Moon Nazis. The players control spaceships to freely roam the space and attack Nazi vessels; various weapons and equipment are at their disposal, from laser cannons and missiles to handy drones and satellites which can be launched from certain ships. The vessels are also equipped with military countermeasures, to protect them from enemy fire.\n\nThe players can access a tactical map of outer space to spot the positions of Nazi forces or any ongoing battles, and thus instantly know where to fly. The ultimate goal is to destroy the secret Nazi base hidden on the Dark Side of the Moon and to keep the Earth safe from the invading spacecraft.\n\nBeing based on the cult movie, the “Iron Sky: Invasion” comes with a touch of politics as well: various nations will offer unique missions, yet to accept or refuse them is up to the player. Some missions tempt the players with special rewards, such as precious upgrades or even brand new ships.\n\nThe players can dock at an allied space station to recharge weapons, purchase upgrades or even switch ships. Almost all spaceships that appear in the film can be controlled in game (except for the largest one), including the South-Korean scout ship “Zerg”, the Australian bomber “Dundee”, or the UK fighter “Spitfire”. The availability of some will depend on the completion of certain missions.\n\nThe ships’ sub-systems can be further upgrade in the hangar: for example, upgrading the offensive systems will increase the number of weapons and boost their power, while an engine upgrade will improve the ship’s speed and range of interception. Upgrades require special resources, which can be scavenged from destroyed enemy units or found in outer space.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2duj.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Reality Pump","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"TopWare Interactive","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":1405,"name":"Hawken","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"War is a Machine Pilot hulking death machines and use massive weaponry to destroy your foes in fast-paced FPS gameplay.\n\nHawken is a multiplayer first person shooter that places you inside a mechanized war machine on the battlefield of a dystopian world.

Well played, people!*\n*Whoa! You made us #1 in Simulation! Thanks, we love you people!*\n\nA note from the developer:\n\nHi, and thanks for taking a look at Virtual Families 2! We have been working on it for quite a while, and we’re very happy to be able to finally share this new chapter with everyone.\n\nBefore you skip down to the bullet points and screenshots, let me say a few quick words about this game, and life simulations in general: I love life simulation games. I have always been passionate about designing them, and almost everything that comes out of Last Day of Work is a life sim of some kind. This one, in particular, thrills me so much because it is designed to have a life of its own: unpredictable and so different each time I play it, and each time another player plays it. I love that the story unfolds differently for everyone who plays it, and your experience with the game might be wildly different from your friends’ experience.\n\nDesigning this type of game, however, has its own special challenges. The main challenge is that EVERYTHING in life is a great idea to add to a game like this. There are SO many great ideas, and we simply cannot put them all in at launch. So, while I hope the game captivates you as much as it does us, there will inevitably be things that you feel are missing and you would love to see added (tell us!).\n\nWe plan to update the content in this game. We want to add pets, hidden puzzles, more storyline, more events, tons of new things to buy, and the list goes on and on. We will also continue to tune and deepen all the game's inner workings that control happiness, health, and everything else. While the game has been balanced to be playable for free and without purchasing anything, we hope that you will find something compelling enough in the game to give us support so that we can continue to create fun new updates.\n\nEnjoy Virtual Families 2! Please visit our Facebook page and our forums to give your own amazing ideas and suggestions, and don’t forget to check in on your little family or they will get very sad. :)\n\nWith sincere gratitude, \nArthur Humphrey\nLead Designer, Last Day of Work\n\n\nVirtual Families 2 has all this and more:\n\n* Adopt a little person and start a family. Make babies and pass the house on to the kids!\n\n* Train your little people to behave as you wish by praising and scolding them.\n\n* Your little people will send you messages, thanking, pleading, and praising you for caring for them.\n\n* Runs in True Real Time. Your little people continue to live, eat, grow, and work when the app is switched off.\n\n* Your little family is in your time zone! Is it getting dark where you live? Your little family is probably getting ready for bed then...\n\n* Highly varied, unpredictable game play. No two games run the same. \n\n* Make babies. Cure illnesses. Help nurture and guide generations of your family.\n\n* Restore the house. Finish and fix rooms. Shop and decorate.\n\n\nRecommended for people who enjoy Virtual Villagers and other life simulation games!\n\nVisit our Official Virtual Families site at www.VirtualFamilies.com for instructions, strategy guides, and much more! \n\nLDW games have been awarded with:\n\n* Sim Game of the Year – Game Tunnel\n* The Zeebys – Gamezebo\n* Parents Choice Recommended Award\n* iParenting Media Award\n\nCheck out our other hit games like Virtual Town, Fish Tycoon, Virtual Villagers, and more at https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/ldw-software-llc/id297606729","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2n8x.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Last Day of Work","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":85030,"name":"Christmas Wonderland 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It's Christmas time and Santa's Elves are working non-stop to get all the toys made in time in Christmas Wonderland 2, an indie adventure game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/idzo385lxolj0c9g4hr0.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":65056,"name":"Bubble Guppies","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bubble Guppies is a DS game based on the pre-school TV show of the same name.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mjc2cvy4jylgrdiw8eec.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Black Lantern Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Play","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":64188,"name":"Minigore 2: Zombies","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"John Gore is back in Minigore 2, the second game in the series.
