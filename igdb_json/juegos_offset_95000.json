Initially, the player has a small bakery and the amount of cash to dispose.\n\nAnd with time, along with the development of his bakery, taking care of acquiring new customers and expanding his stores, the player gains new opportunities. In the future, the player will be able to expand his company with new and larger bakeries, which will significantly increase production possibilities. And by introducing new products to its offer, it can increase revenues in such stores and thus increase its profits. The player also has marketing campaigns at his disposal, which can significantly affect the number of customers in the player's stores. The number of customers and by the volume of sales can also be influenced by high-quality products, thanks to which the player can win occasional bakery festivals that take place from time to time.\n\nAnd with such a strong position, the player can conquer new markets in other cities, creating their warehouses and new stores there. On the other hand, however, the player has full freedom in action. It can focus on the production of the cheapest products and reach as many customers as possible.\n\nThe game itself is designed so that in each of the \"modules\" I can add functions and add depth to game features. And so far, the game does not yet contain all the functions and mechanics that I would like to see in this game. But mainly add depth to the production mechanics about production lines. Whether as part of the purchase of \"technology\" or building your own production line. I also think a lot about the introduction of the logistics module. It would be naturally connected to the warehouse. This would allow the introduction of delivery elements to the game. Purchase of delivery vehicles and possible plans for the supply stores. And that would probably be my biggest ideas for adding content. In the meantime, I will want to add new minor functions and improvements like a bank and other smaller features whcih will balance gameplay.\n\nA Few Words From the Author\nBy creating Bakery Biz Tycoon, my main goal was to create a title that will relate to old school tycoon games. In which the player has to focus more on the macro of managing the enterprise than on micro-management or time management. I tried to create a more complex production than typical Time Management games, but simple enough for the time spent with Bakery Biz Tycoon to be fun. And I wish all this and I hope that my first game will give you at least a few hours of pleasant gameplay.

Players that enjoy replay value can expect around 70 possible decisions to explore, some of which will even influence Kazuki's \"romantic\" relationship with his female colleagues at Igrasil.\n\nAs for adult content in Bloody Chronicles, four unlockable episodes called \"IF mode\" are releasing soon and will feature Igrasil members Aki, Suzumi, Kaoru, and Akito.

We have chosen the five most beloved logical games and bundled them together! You can play them either against the AI or against a friend (on the same console). Fill your coffee breaks with some brain stimulation! In this bundle you will find: TIC-TAC-TOE (also known as Noughts and Crosses, or Xs and Os) Two players alternate placing Xs and Os onto the grid. The first player to create a straight line of three of his or her symbols... wins! CHECKERS (also known as Draughts) Players move their pieces diagonally from one square to another square. When a player jumps over their opponent's piece, you take that piece from the board. The first player to lose all of his or her pieces loses the game. MEMORY GAME The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board covered with cards faced down with minimum number of moves. Each separate move is to turn over any two cards. If they match you take them from board, if not you turn them back over. MINES The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \"mines\" without detonating any of them. Numbers on revealed squares show how many mines are adjacent to that square. GOMOKU Two players alternate placing white and black tokens onto the grid.
