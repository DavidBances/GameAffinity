Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.\n\nSimilarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co61kq.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"},{"id":0,"name":"PC-8800 Series"}]},{"id":232826,"name":"Zavas II: The Prophecy of Mehitae","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The follow-up to Zavas is, like its predecessor, a fantasy role-playing game with Japanese anime-like aesthetics, but more Western-oriented free-form gameplay with more emphasis on character development than on a character-driven plot. Through a series of choices the player make the protagonist (always named Majon, but with different family names) to be a prince, the son of a merchant, or the son of a fisherman. In the beginning the player character undergoes a series of trials (which may include arcade-style mini-games, mathematical tasks, etc.) which determine his eventual attributes and also follow his growth until he turns sixteen and embarks on a quest to find companions and defeat an evil sorcerer in accordance with an ancient prophecy.\n\nThough the game has a traditional overworld with towns, hostile areas, and fairly simple turn-based battles, many of its gameplay features deviate from the standard Japanese template. Every NPC can be approached with different attitudes (including bribe and usage of items), and often a specific attitude is needed to further the hero's goals. Money can be earned and managed through various activities. Experience points are awarded for conversations and other actions besides combat. An important factor is the party's stamina: a certain amount of it must be reached in order to access key plot-advancing locations, and building up stamina through side quests and other actions occupies a considerable portion of the gameplay. The protagonist has a ship at his disposal from the beginning of the game, and it is possible to physically sail across the sea and access any location, provided the stamina level is high enough.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co61kr.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":232827,"name":"Zatsugaku Olympic Watanabe Wataru-Hen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Zatsugaku Olympic Watanabe Wataru-Hen is a Quiz game, developed and published by Hard, which was released in Japan in 1988.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co61ks.jpg","releaseYear":1988,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC-9800 Series"}]},{"id":232828,"name":"Yuuwaku","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"One day a young woman comes to the detective office and asks to find a picture that was left by her father.
