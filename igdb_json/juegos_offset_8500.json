The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.\nThe game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.\nThe release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ze0.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Midway","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tec Toy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Playtronic","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":8996,"name":"The Seven Cities of Gold: Commemorative Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A PC remake of the classic game designed by Dan and Bill Bunten.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/hw3zhq7wqqahlzjxsppb.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ozark Softscape","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":8997,"name":"NBA Jam","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"3-on-3 arcade-style basketball with over 50 of the NBA's all time greatest players.

Other versions of the concept were written soon after: a version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC, among others.\n\nA full game of Rocket, one of the early versions of the game type. The player has only spent fuel at the last moment, and as a result has crashed into the moon.\n\nAll three text-based games require the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3gcp.jpg","releaseYear":1970,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jim Storer","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PDP-8"}]},{"id":9129,"name":"Moonlander","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Moonlander (also known as Lunar Lander) is an early computer game made for the DEC GT40 computer and is the first graphical game in the lunar landing simulator subgenre, as well as the first one in real-time.\n\nIt is notable for being the first video game with an Easter egg, a lone McDonalds on the moon's surface that can be interacted with or destroyed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6tcd.jpg","releaseYear":1973,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jack Burness","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Digital Equipment Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DEC GT40"},{"id":0,"name":"PDP-10"},{"id":0,"name":"PDP-11"}]},{"id":9130,"name":"Seaman","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Seaman is a virtual pet video game for the Sega Dreamcast.

Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.\nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \"slow cones\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \"zippers\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.\nPlayers have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling \"Nintendo\" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the \"Racer\" to the \"Speed demon\" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle.

The ROMs themselves were modified to suit the competition, and the winners would be determined by an overall score count from all three games. High placing winners took home a cash prize amongst other goodies. However, the finalists of this competition each took home their own copy of the specially made ROM on a standard NES cartridge. Another issue of the cartridge, colored in a golden tint similar to The Legend of Zelda cartridge, was even more elusive and was only distributed as a prize giveaway in Nintendo Power Magazine. Today, these two cartridge variations are some of the most elusive and sought after video games in history and are often considered a holy grail of video game collecting.
