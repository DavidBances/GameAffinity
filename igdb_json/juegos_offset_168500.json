Lia Fyle is a half-human, half-vampire girl fighting on the side of the deviants as they embark upon a turnaround strategy, the “Siege on the Holy Land’.

The polarity and color of your character can be changed to absorb enemy bullets of the same polarity while charging the special weapon in the process and doing double damage to enemies of the opposite polarity.

Within lurks an evil unknown to man that bears a danger so much greater than any threat yet witnessed. A dark, mysterious power has manifested itself in the depths of the gas giant, absorbing life and technology, and assimilating all in its wake. Spacecraft, pilots, androids, and computers: Nothing is safe. No one can escape the virus that infects all life forms, turning once brave heroes and peaceful colonists alike into ravaging, chaotic forces, fighting each other and infecting more in the process. Soulless technology and hate-driven humanoids are all that's left of Earth's once-proud fleet. The galaxy as we know it is threatening to fall apart. War, death, and bedlam have taken hold of civilisation. Humankind is at the brink of extinction. Those who aren't yet infected--the resistance, a band of mercenaries, soldiers and civilians--are Earth's final hope, and they have one goal in common: To stop the deadly infection and destroy the core of all evil, hidden in the depths of Conceyta. Scouts have undertaken a merciless mission to bring detailed plans and data on the location of the power and its defence line in a last attempt to save humankind. So it has come to be that the last remaining pilot, a mercenary and bounty hunter, is the only chance of survival, ironically driven by the desire for wealth and fame. Left with little choice, the resistance has developed a star fighter capable of intercepting the evil force, equipped with a deadly weapon system and of utmost agility. With no time to lose, the 10th and final prototype of the ship is handed to the pilot. Its name: \"Sldner-X\". Should the pilot succeed, his name shall live on in the memories of man forever to come. And so the battle begins.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3bbc.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EastAsiaSoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"SideQuest Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":269808,"name":"Chikyuu no Arukikata DS: Seoul, Busan '07-'08","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co76a7.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":269805,"name":"Chikyuu no Arukikata DS: England '07-'08","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co76a4.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":269804,"name":"Chikyuu no Arukikata DS: Hong Kong '07-'08","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co76a3.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":269750,"name":"Chikyuu no Arukikata DS: Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou '07-'08","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7679.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":269591,"name":"Jinsei 8-Man-7000-Kai no Shokuji wo Tanoshiku suru","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co760a.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":217755,"name":"Hakarena Heart: Kimi ga Tame ni Kagayaki wo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An otome game for PS2.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5a3m.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Russell Pure","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"}]},{"id":208683,"name":"Daycare Nightmare","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7wqf.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":202560,"name":"The Fright Before Christmas","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Help Billy, Mandy and Grim destroy the evil toys that have taken over Santa's toyshop.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4s6d.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Cartoon Network Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":84853,"name":"Shanghai Wii","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Japanese Wii import game, based on the popular oriental board game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zbdmfohlbfmpsns6oyjh.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Success","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":83869,"name":"Bus Simulator 2008","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bus Simulator puts you behind the steering wheel of a traditional urban bus and challenges you to complete \"missions\", that is, complete any of the city routes that bus must follow.

While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction. The kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, remains isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat. Uhra, at war with Khent, a nation of beastmen, sends its forces to the Highlands of Wohl for a decisive battle at the start of the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3tos.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Feelplus","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microsoft Game Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mistwalker","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":5444,"name":"PixelJunk Monsters","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Tikiman the Forest Defender is in trouble.

From tending to the fields where your cows graze to gathering eggs for sale at the town market, Farm Frenzy is as stimulating as the real thing-- only you won't have to experience the nasty smells! You will, however, be required to invest the money you earn in new equipment. Building a cheese dairy, for example, allows you to process your milk on the spot and make even more cash.\n\nTo beat a level in Farm Frenzy, you must complete a specific task, such as producing a certain number of eggs. Each new level is more challenging than the last, so you must increase the capacity of your warehouse and improve the performance of your production facilities. You can even buy a larger truck capable of delivering more goods to market! All of this makes dealing with the occasional bear easier. Featuring compelling and enjoyable gameplay, Farm Frenzy lets you give Old MacDonald a run for the money.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2nhy.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Alawar","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Alawar","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mobile-Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Melesta","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HeroCraft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"iWin","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"ak tronic","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"BlackBerry OS"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}]},{"id":313541,"name":"Dr Dokkoy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"I escaped from the spaceship and returned to the earth.\nApparently, some experiments seem to have been done here.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8ogd.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Aztec Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":310649,"name":"Marippy","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Marippy is a Touhou fan game based on the arcade game Mappy.

The inside of the magic castle starts from the castle gate and is divided into sections such as the armory and the magic laboratory.

Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.\n\nTarget Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.\n\nDefender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.\n\nRanger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.\n\nThe Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3ocw.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo EAD Software Development Group No.3","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":928,"name":"Unreal Tournament III","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unreal Tournament 3 marks the return of the world's premiere first-person shooter to Xbox 360.

His plan is to feed them to an inter-dimensional beast called the \"Ifrit\" who needs to eat them to become invincible . After that, he plans to release the Ifrit into the world in order to destroy it. However, to open the portal to the Ifrit's world, the seven Chaos Emeralds are required. Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it.\nMeanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega's plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Professor Gerald Robotnik's journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way.\n\nAll of the teams meet up at the Mystic Haunt Zone where the portal to the Ifrit's world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic defeat the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit's dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble.\n\nSonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs, and Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future.
