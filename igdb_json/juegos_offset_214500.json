The area of the hole is rendered in light green, all areas outside the hole are rendered in a medium blue. On the larger holes the green is rendered as a dark green hole circle with the hole near the center. There are several obstacles that can appear, including trees, sand traps, and water features. On difficulty A, balls that go out of bounds stay there and must be hit back in; on difficulty B, the balls stick to the edge of the area. Balls hit near the water can soar over it, or if they land into the water, the ball is placed back where the shot was taken. Balls hit into sand traps will stick to the sides of the traps, and it takes a more powerful swing to free the ball. The player only uses one club - the amount of time the fire button is held down determines how much power the ball will be hit with, and how far it will go.

Rather, you respawn and keep on playing. The only way to lose a life is letting the king get abducted. Another interesting mechanic of note is that the balloons stop attacking and descending when one grabs ahold of the king, and they will keep still until the king is back on the ground. This creates a risk versus reward mechanic and entices you to let the balloon carry the king high enough so you can take out more balloons, then rescuing the king just in time.\n\nKing & Balloon was also one of the first games to have speech, and it still holds up better than most contemporary or even later examples.

Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte Magazine and mailed $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer.[1] Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. For example, the March–April 1979 issue of Recreational Computing describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published.[4]\n\nCommercialization through electronic media\nWhen magnetic media publishing became widely available, a Navy Petty Officer, Paul Lohnes, ported Sargon to the TRS-80, altering both graphics, input, and housekeeping routines leaving the Spracklen's chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: Hayden Software. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software. In the early 1980s SARGON CHESS was ported to several earlier microcomputers, i.e. NASCOM (by Bits & PCs, 1981), Exidy Sorcerer, Sharp MZ 80K,[5] and many others. A complete rewrite was necessary later for the Apple II port, made by Kathleen's brother Gary Shannon. Both were published by Hayden Software.\n\nSequels\nThe Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program[1] and released Sargon II. In 1978 it tied for third at the ninth North American Computer Chess Championship despite being seeded ninth of 12 entries. Sargon finished only behind Belle and Chess 4.7, and defeated AWIT—running on a $5 million Amdahl mainframe—amazing the audience.[6][3][1] That year they published a series of articles in BYTE on computer chess programming,[2][7] stating \"we think it would be nice if not everyone had to reinvent the wheel\".[6]\n\nSargon II was ported to a variety of personal computers popular in the early 1980s.[8] The game engine featured multiple levels of lookahead to make it more accessible to beginning chess players. BYTE in 1980 estimated that Sargon II had a 1500 rating at the highest tournament-time difficulty level, and speculated that it was the best chess program on sale, including dedicated devices.[9]\n\nSargon 2.5, sold as a ROM module for the Chafitz Modular Game System, was identical to Sargon II but incorporated pondering.[10] It received a 1641 rating at the Paul Masson tournament in June–July 1979, and 1736 at the San Jose City College Open in January 1980.[3]\n\nSargon 3.0 finished in seventh place at the October 1979 North American Computer Chess Championship. The competition had improved, but 3.0 drew against Cray Blitz and easily defeated Mychess, its main microcomputer rival. In December 3.0 easily won the second microcomputer championship in London.[3]\n\nIn 1980, the Spracklens' Reversi game finished in first place at a computer tournament at Northwestern University, and in 1981 it finished in third place at the Santa Cruz Open Othello Tournament.[11]\n\nSargon III was a complete rewrite from scratch. Instead of an exchange evaluator, this version used a capture search algorithm. Also included was a chess opening repertoire. This third version was written originally for the 6502 assembler and was commercially published by Hayden Software in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for 68000 assembly, Sargon III was the first third-party executable software for the Macintosh.[1]\n\nAfter the demise of Hayden Software, later chess programs were also released under the name Sargon, including Sargon IV (Spinnaker Software), Sargon V (Activision) and a CD-i title simply named Sargon Chess. The Spracklens concurrently wrote the engines for the dedicated chess computers produced by Fidelity Electronics, which won the first four World Microcomputer Chess Championships.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/y5jp2huijh08yv9zlr4m.jpg","releaseYear":1979,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore VIC-20"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":39992,"name":"Invinco","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Space Invaders clone","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/h1oplqjgdyqsng7kdjv3.jpg","releaseYear":1979,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39517,"name":"Side Trak","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Side Trak is a black & white man-versus-machine game where the goal is to pick up all of the waiting passengers with your train while avoiding the computer-driver \"killer engine\" which aims to take you out in a head-on collision.

The game is also notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy, resembling a life bar, a mechanic that has now become common in the majority of modern action games. The game allowed the player to refuel energy between each level, and it featured a large variety of alien enemies.\n\nThe player controls a space craft which must fend off UFOs, meteors, and comets. Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly diminishing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily and a large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and dock with the player's spacecraft, allowing the energy to be refilled. There are 3-4 recognizable stages as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear. After these, the mothership will appear, and the cycle starts over; this continues indefinitely until the energy reaches zero.\n\nThere are two known bootleg versions of this game called Space Phantoms and Solar Flight.

Below the mothership is an asteroid field and below that, the surface of the moon. There are three platforms which can be landed on and six stranded astronauts that need rescuing. You control a small spacecraft. The player must press the button to release their spacecraft from the mothership and manoeuvre through the asteroid field. The craft can only move left or right or use up a finite amount of fuel by engaging the thrust (the same button again) to slow its descent. If the craft is landed successfully on one of the available platforms, one of the astronauts will run towards and board the craft.\n\nThe asteroid belt now changes into a swarm of flying saucers, some of which drop bombs. The player must now guide the spacecraft back up to the mothership (the craft ascends without using up fuel), avoiding the flying saucers. The thrust button is now a fire button which can be used to shoot at enemies above (as in Space Invaders). Finally, the craft must be docked with the mothership using the bay opening. If the side of the mothership or any part of the ship outside of the opening is hit, the rescued astronaut falls to the surface and dies. If the mothership is missed altogether, the craft explodes. After all six people have been rescued (or killed providing the player still has lives remaining), the game starts again at a higher level.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/v1zwo8vbzikc6kwdmply.jpg","releaseYear":1979,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":21674,"name":"Cutie Q","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Pinball","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Cutie Q is is the third and final game in the Gee Bee trilogy.\n\nThe player controls a set of paddles with a rotary knob, the objective being to score as many points possible by deflecting a ball against blocks, ghosts, spinners and other objects on the playfield.\n\nCutie Q is described as Namco's first \"character game\", thanks to its use of colorful and cute character designs, a choice that would be a major influence on Toru Iwatani's next project, Pac-Man.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6szx.jpg","releaseYear":1979,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":6118,"name":"Monaco GP","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Monaco GP is an arcade game that was released by Sega in 1979.

The game is remembered as having quite advanced graphics for the time and being the first video game based upon or to have noticeable references to Star Wars.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4v8o.jpg","releaseYear":1979,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":131143,"name":"SF-HiSplitter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A special version of Space Fever called SF-Hisplitter was released the same year and features aliens that are double the width of the standard variety, which can either be destroyed completely or split into two smaller aliens depending on where they are shot.
