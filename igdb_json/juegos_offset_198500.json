If the player overuses this method though, the playable character starts spinning out of control. Should the player move outside the race tracks, the racer's acceleration will decreases noticeably on the rough terrain. The race track's sidelines also have obstacles that will stop the player altogether if the playable characters crash into them.

One day, Nyan questions the Chinese Zodiac and wonders why a cat isn't part of the zodiac while others like the dog and monkey are. Dodonpa isn't really bothered by it so much and sort of teases Nyan but then he too wonders about it and Nyan (feeling inspired) gets optimistic. The story of the game has Nyan and Dodonpa eventually going to meet a fairy after battling 12 animals (specifically of the Chinese Zodiac) in order to make the request that cats be part of the zodiac. Apparently, if you play with player 2 and beat the game, the ending is slightly different or so I hear. \n \nKokontouzai Eto Monogatari (KEM from this point forward) roughly translates into \"Chinese Astrology Story for All Ages\". However, the game has a lot of stages for a puzzle game (13 to be exact) and the speed picks up pretty quickly so as childish as it looks, it definitely requires skill on the later levels. It is a fairly simple and charming game (it's funny how the cow/ox of stage 2 will \"power-up\" and win by drinking milk, lol), but the CPU definitely shows aggression pretty quickly (if you couldn't tell by watching this video). Visually, the game is pretty good and doesn't do anything over-the-top, but still manages to be pretty decent for the genre. The audio is okay; I don't have any qualms with it, but nothing really jumps out at me (the music is geared for the kids). It's not necessarily my cup of tea, but it isn't necessarily bad (I have different tastes in music). \n \nKEM plays like many other drop puzzlers in the general sense; you match three blocks and they disappear. You can create chains and drop big piles of junk on your opponent. To destroy said junk and get your breathing room back, you must match blocks that are touching the junk. When you do so, the blocks and junk next to it will both vanish. KEM does have a trick up its sleeve; orbs that when matched, destroy all treasure boxes (just another type of block that you can chain with) as well as any orbs you didn't match that are scattered on your screen. By matching three orbs together when your screen is full of blocks, you can cause massive chain reactions or massive gatherings of blocks to be destroyed all at once. Naturally, you will deal a huge blow to your adversary when you do this so timing is essential (and the opponent can too so watch out!). \n \nAt any rate, KEM is a pretty decent game to play with silly characters and decent audio/visuals.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":11665,"name":"Young Merlin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"After trying to rescue a drowning young woman, the the hero of Young Merlin is drawn into a fantasy world which is threatened by the evil Shadow King.

You're thrown into the labyrinthine dungeons of Castle Ragor and must now get out, overcoming the traps and obstacles set by its nefarious master, Megrim. Explore the walls of Ragor and find an exit. That will not be easy as your jailer tries to confuse and mislead you, and the dungeons are full of Megrim's minions and dangerous monsters.\n\nThe game is controlled entirely with the mouse, which is used to interact with the environment, manipulate inventory items and move the character around by clicking the navigational arrows on the interface. You can use items like spells, healing potions and poisons in fights with the enemies. Combat flows in real time and the outcome of any encounter ultimately depends on how fast you click the attack button, located in the centre of the navigational arrows. The simple combat system automatically uses an offensive magic spell if one is selected and there is enough mana, and otherwise switches to conventional weapons if such are available and readied (held in the player character's hands).\n\nExploration is much simplified thanks to the built-in automap, which also highlights fake walls and switches for the player's convenience. If a tile currently occupied by the player contains any items that can be picked, an eye icon will pop up on the interface, with the items then shown in a separate small window. Some tiles have a red banner with a golden question mark, which when activated will display messages, often coming from Megrim, the main antagonist of the game, and sometimes hints.\n\nUnlike many dungeon crawlers of this type, there is no party but only one player character, and no character generation. The only choice given to the player is that of the protagonist's sex, which does not affect starting stats. Experience is gained by the usual means of killing monsters.\n\nEscape from Ragor has a hunger/thirst system, with hunger and thirst levels displayed on the character screen. These can be replenished by using food and drink found in the dungeon. You get a flask of water at the start, which may be later refilled in fountains that are found in some areas of the dungeon.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1y7c.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":119396,"name":"Magic of Endoria","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The strategy-game Magic of Endoria takes place in the fantasy kingdom Endoria.
