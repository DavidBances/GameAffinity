Many adventurers delved into these mazes, hunting for riches, and it wasn't long till the children started following their dreams of becoming heroes. To aid these children, the Adventurer Academies were founded, to prepare them in their perilous journeys. Players start out at the Particus Academy, the newest of the academies, where they'll be able to assemble their party from students, each hailing from one of the 10 available races, 15 professions and 3 alignments. Each race has a different attitude toward the others, keeping the party compatibility system already featured in the previous games. The academy serves as a home base, where students can modify their team, purchase/sell equipment, practice alchemy, heal/revive injured party-members and take on new quests. The labyrinths have an overall similar layout, but a few sections are randomly generated upon entrance, so are the enemy and item locations. Battles are turn-based, with a tension gauge slowly filling, allowing the party to unleash Gambits upon their foes. If the whole party is defeated in one of the labyrinths, as a last resort, a rescue team can be sent after them. The longer the rescue team takes to find them, the higher the chance that certain items will be lost, or even party members could die permanently.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ys2.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":63897,"name":"Babel Deluxe","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Test your word skills in 25 unique game types and watch your tower soar.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/megrbjoxw9d9bahqsvy9.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":63898,"name":"Cylinder: Puzzles Returned","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A puzzle game developed by Mighty Rabbit Studios.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8rxu.jpg","releaseYear":2024,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Mighty Rabbit Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":63899,"name":"CSR Racing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"CSR Racing is a racing game for mobile devices.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/kjr0puokurqoim5shlik.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"BossAlien","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":63900,"name":"We Sing Superstar Quiz","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"We Sing Superstar Quiz is a quiz game offshoot in the We Sing franchise.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/s1gtzp3vsjefg2rioefr.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":63901,"name":"Sonic's Edusoft","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Scrapped educational Sonic game from early in the hedgehog's existence.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bhplzx2uhn9cxcwvilud.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"}]},{"id":63902,"name":"Nazo no Minigame","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Nazo no Minigame is a Japanese DSiWare title.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/mizyaspr66tegftafg3o.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":63903,"name":"Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2013","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2013 is a baseball game that allows players to compete in Japan's professional baseball league, with licensed team and player names.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co59xa.jpg","releaseYear":2013,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Pawapuro Productions","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":63904,"name":"Sonic Tweet","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sonic Tweet was a social game in Japan that allowed players to fight Dr. Eggman using Twitter posts and earn one of 500 virtual trading cards.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ultutl9ve65he9lgwrvp.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":63905,"name":"Orion's Forge","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Help Orion create new constellations with challenging puzzles.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/evmzcuxomg2nnalvbt0i.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":63906,"name":"Major Magnet","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Use the power of magnets to escape the facility.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ji2a3ocpfcmimwgbk58m.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":63907,"name":"Zack & Ombra: The Phantom Amusement Park","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co80ld.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":63908,"name":"Little Chomp","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Little Chomp puts a physics spin on classic platforming.

Would-be adventurers must be simultaneously cautious because enemies can win by using the same tactics! Each class behaves differently when used. Some classes have abundant movement capabilities and can hit a lot of enemies, while others remain stationary and can safely attack from a far. The gameplay is simple to understand yet savvy players will need to use their warriors and the battlefield strategically to progress farther. \n \nCurrently, Knight Slinger allows players to control up to 500 warriors across multiple game modes including real-time PVP.

Akin to snowboarding, the sports popularity is spreading like wildfire around the globe. Evolving from a combination of waterskiing, snowboarding, skating and surfing, wakeboarding is not only the world's fastest-growing water board sport but also the most accessible. It can be done on waterski lakes or on the sea. Riders are able to perform amazing BIG AIR tricks (Backwash, Bindings, Edge, Fakie etc), whilst being towed behind a boat, with the use of big boards and big wakes. The rider stands sideways on a shorter, wider board similar in concept to a snowboard. If you have no imagination, look at these shots from real wakeboarding (shot1, shot2, shot3). So now I think you have an idea kind of sport wakeboarding is, so back to the game. \nBig Air Wakeboarding features over eight distinct characters, hundreds of different mind-bending trick combos, multiple jumps and obstacles, real wakeboards from O'Brien, and Darin Shapiro - the 2000 X Games and Pro Wakeboard Tour Champion. In the game you can choose from Career, Competition and Quick Start. In Career mode you have to collect Gas cans, to improve your character over time.These Gas cans unlock new board graphics and improve on the quality of all boards. Gas can also unlock better boats with bigger wakes and more advanced tie-ins. In Competition you got three runs out in the open water to try and rack up the most points - any medal in a competition will unlock the next course. If you like skateboarding and snowboarding games, maybe this game could be quite interesting for you.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ihttzw6jfynibmss6lcz.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision Value","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":64243,"name":"Puzziball","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Puzzle game where the player has to guide a ball through a multilayer maze with sliding doors.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/r9uybc6kynp6rx2km6ox.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":64244,"name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Double Damage","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Double Damage is a 2009 online Flash game developed by Urban Squall as a promotional tool for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Smash-Up.
