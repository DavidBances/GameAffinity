It is the fifth installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise and the first to use three-dimensional character models instead of sprites.\n\nIn Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. It features similar tag team game mechanics to earlier games in the series, along with new methods of play designed to make the game more accessible to new players. The game was produced by Ryota Niitsuma, who had previously worked on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, which utilizes the same simplified three-button attack system.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and character roster, while criticizing its online component and lack of features and game modes. More than 2 million units were shipped worldwide a month after its debut, rendering it a commercial success. Less than a year after its release, Capcom announced an updated version of the game, titled Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The standalone update was released in November 2011, and featured additional characters, stages, and gameplay tweaks.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ye3.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Eighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Capcom","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":232842,"name":"Devilish Valentine","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Find differences in the pictures about Valentine's Day with the devil and angel.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co61lr.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"SPIL GAMES","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":198059,"name":"Bomberman Dojo","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5u66.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Hudson Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":148165,"name":"Shadow the Hedgehog in Sonic the Hedgehog","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shadow the Hedgehog in Sonic the Hedgehog brings the Ultimate Lifeform to South Island to put a stop to Dr. Robotnik's Evil Plans!\n\nHe must skate across 7 perilous zones to free the animals he's trapped in his robots and collect the 6 Chaos Emeralds!\n\nShadow's journey however isn't the same as that blue rodent, as he has the ability to use rings to fuel his rocket shoes for a boost!
