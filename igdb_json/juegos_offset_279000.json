This living world will give the player endless reasons to explore and interact with such as ongoing open world events ranging from hordes, rescues, and bosses.

However, if eliminated, your team will need a revival syringe to bring you back into the fight which can be found in rare loot drops and/or crafted from a lengthy recipe of uncommon materials.
