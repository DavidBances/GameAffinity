Sadly the game was cancelled, as we can read on the old Horny Dog website: “The Sega announcement that they were ceasing production of Dreamcast hardware wasn’t much of a help, as well as the fact one or two members of our team didn’t have the game’s best interest at heart. […] We had spent 15 months developing the title, and although many of us felt we achieved so much, it wasn’t enough to save the title.” \n \nThe developer's website described Hellgate as follows: \"Imagine a crossover between Quake and WipeOut. Got that image? Hellgate meshes these two genres, with high speed at your fingertips, as well as some meaty weaponry! There will be four gigantic realms to conquer, as well as ten formidable weapons to defeat the many demons and monsters lurking within Hell.\" \n \n\"We will also be supporting Dreamcast’s online capabilities with online Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Sumo and Time Trial modes, and also feature offline 4 player Deathmatch and link-up Deathmatch modes. The exciting thing is, Hellgate could well be the first Dreamcast game to support 12 – yes – 12 people.\" \n \nIn March 2009, a playable beta was leaked online.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xmk.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":125401,"name":"Low-Fi","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As the player, you are “low-fi”, the street name given to those who cannot merge with the platform, a ubiquitous virtual reality simulation where most of the population now live their lives.

After the setback in front of Moscow in 1941, the mighty German Army surged forward again in the summer of '42.

After several months of bloody house to house fighting in the fall, the Soviet positions were reduced to pockets of rubble, barely 300 meters from the Volga. As the season turned to winter, Hitler remained fixated on taking the city, ultimately leading to disaster for his troops. He had badly underestimated the Soviet army's ability to mount an offensive on his flanks. The Russians cut through weak, poorly equipped, Rumanian troops and encircled the entire Sixth Army. In Stalingrad '42 you can re-fight this titanic struggle, exploring both the historical situation in addition to a number of plausible \"What If\" situations; a German retreat, a corseted flank defense, or a powerful panzer rescue force made available had Rommel been successful at El Alamein.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124709,"name":"Road Block","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2r5x.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124708,"name":"Ultimate Action Hero","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124707,"name":"Drone Attack!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124706,"name":"Square Fighter","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124704,"name":"Johnny 9: The Return","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124696,"name":"Wild Beyond","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2rvs.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124692,"name":"Throne of Gods","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124688,"name":"Deep Aquarium","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124681,"name":"Reflections on the River","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Chase your happily ever after.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":124673,"name":"Six Rules","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Hung on a piece on thread in the foyer, a bamboo scroll read:\n\nRules\n1) You must not let any strangers into the house.
