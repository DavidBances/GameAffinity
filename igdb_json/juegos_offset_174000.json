The inhabitants are subjected to torture or injected with a substance, transforming them into servant mummies. Not even the mummy of King Ramses is spared. As world leaders' attempts to send armed forces fail, you are selected among a few of the world's best special forces to infiltrate Karnak and eliminate the invaders from within. However, the mission takes a dark turn when your helicopter is shot down, leaving you alone to navigate through the chaos, aiming to complete your mission and survive.\n\nIn contrast to later console adaptations, the game's 20 single-player levels are played consecutively. The player searches for keys and secret areas to progress to the next level, akin to other games of the time, such as DOOM. The game employs a single save slot for each playthrough and incorporates a checkpoint system, enabling players to resume from the latest checkpoint they have discovered.
