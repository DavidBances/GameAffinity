You work in a team with two to four players and an angry garbage truck driver. Your job is to empty garbage cans and containers. Sadly, your contract doesn't state what kind of work you are required to do, so your boss loads you with all kinds of extra tasks, including firefighting and forest work. Naturally you are completely understaffed, and your short-tempered driver has no intention of stopping the truck to wait for you, just because you couldn't empty all the garbage cans while extinguishing a raging wildfire. Luckily, there are heaps of powerups that help you with all those tasks, so your stress level won't reach dangerous heights... Or so you thought! Due to an accident in your bosses DIY time reverting device, you travel back into medieval times with seemingly no way to return and to make matters worse, your contract states that you are still required to work!

This version is identical and hosted online, to allow players to try it out without making it to the event.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co667m.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":179653,"name":"The Invincible Run-Gun-Bot","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Metroidvania platformer shooter with heavy NES influences","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":179654,"name":"Dismal Anhedonia Land","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"IT WON'T EVER FEEL AS GOOD","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":179655,"name":"Last Chance to Green","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Made for Ludum Dare 34.
