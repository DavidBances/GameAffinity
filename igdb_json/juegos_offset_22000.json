The Terrans claimed Earth, headquarters to their massive trade corporations. The genetically engineered Progen, bred for perfection, commanded the wastes of Mars. And the Jenquai, ever seeking knowledge, created great space stations to orbit the moons of Jupiter. Peace was shattered when the first stargate, an ancient artifact built by an unknown people, was discovered. Coveting its secrets for their own, the Jenquai hid the Gate from the other races. But their efforts were in vain; within months, a spy employed by the Terran conglomerate InfinitiCorp revealed the Gate's existence to the outraged Terrans and Progen. Humanity was suddenly thrust into conflict, an epic battle over control of the Gate. \n \nThe three races fought a devastating nine-year war, dubbed the Gate War, using weapons far deadlier than any previously conceived. Millions of lives were lost, and millions more would have perished had the Terrans not surprised their foes with a sudden cease-fire proposal. After months of negotiations, the three civilizations agreed to share the Gate, and declared an uneasy peace. However, InfinitiCorp had plans of its own. Under utmost secrecy, its scientists had reverse-engineered the Gate's technology, and within a few years the mighty conglomerate announced to the astonished worlds the genesis of the Infinitigate. \n \nFifty years have passed since the invention of the Infinitigate. Progen, Jenquai and Terrans alike have thrived, spreading their civilizations across a dozen star systems, exploiting their riches. However, though the races are at peace, acrimony remains. Tension and distrust govern galactic relations and every citizen fears the day when the spectre of war again raises its shadow.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20ii.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Westwood Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":23765,"name":"Hoyle Casino Empire","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The goal of Hoyle Casino Empire is to create a thriving casino.

In Grim Legions, you control units that move around the map trying to capture towns. Each turn, the towns recruit more units. The aim of the game is simply to wipe out your enemy (destroy all their troops and capture all their towns). There can be up to 4 players, and you can make alliances with other players.\n\nThere are three different types of troop: infantry, archers and cavalry. There's not much difference between these types, archers are just better than infantry, and cavalry better than archers. Unlike a lot of other games, you can combine multiple troop types in one unit (or \"legion\"), and you can split and merge them as much as you like.\n\nMap generation is randomized, but you have a lot of control over it. E.g. if you get sick of your units taking ages to move through the mountains, you can just generate a map without mountains. You can also decide how much of the map you want to be water (which no troops can move through), from 0% to 60%. There are also 3 map sizes to choose from.

But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Messian faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Tokyo Millennium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Messians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. People flock into the encapsulated city, submitting themselves to the strict hierarchy imposed by the Messian Center, where only the privileged living in the Center district are safe from demonic assaults.\n\nA few years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto rescues a man named Hawk, who was fighting for his life against a demon. He trains him to fight in the arena of the Valhalla district, hoping that he would win the tournament, which will grant them both citizenship in the Center district. When Hawk succeeds, he is brought before a Messian bishop, and learns the shocking truth about his own origins and the role he is supposed to play in the grand scheme of events. A new battle for a better future begins.\n\nShin Megami Tensei II retains all the gameplay features of the previous game. The player is able to summon demons, fuse them to create more powerful ones, make them participate in battles, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and the player explores the complex, maze-like dungeons from a first-person perspective view. Like in the first game, the Law, Chaos, and Neutral alignments play an important role: during the course of the game, the player will have to make choices that influence the alignment of the protagonist, steering the storyline into different directions.\n\nNew features include a \"magic succession\" system, which allows demons to carry over their original magic spells when they are fused into new ones, a few additional spells and abilities, and the possibility to play at the casino and win unique items.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7xrd.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Atlus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":23880,"name":"Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei is a Super Famicom remake made by Atlus of Namco’s original Megami Tensei and Megami Tensei 2 games on the Famicom.

It was published by Screenplay in 1983.\n\nPogo Joe is a Q*Bert clone with several extra features. The player takes the role of the eponymous Pogo Joe, a boy on a pogo stick. The game takes place over 65 different levels, each consisting of a different arrangement of barrels. To complete a level, Pogo Joe must jump on every barrel.\n\nTo make Pogo Joe's job harder, several enemies inhabit the levels. They first start out as spherical \"eggs\" of different colours. Colliding with these \"eggs\" kills the enemy within them, but if left alone for a few seconds, the \"eggs\" hatch into different sorts of enemies, contact with which is fatal to Pogo Joe.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/a0qa7fraugwouwfajjm3.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Screenplay","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":23938,"name":"Bega's Battle","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Data East used footage from the film Harmagedon to create a laserdisc video game titled Bega's Battle.

Bega's Battle also used brief full-motion video cut scenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling.

Based on the colour they have different behaviour and some of them require multiple hits. To finish the stage all aliens have to be defeated. The wave is repeated in every stage, but enemies gradually become faster. Just like in the regular Galaga, the largest enemies can move down and fire a fixed beam that makes the area smaller to move. After a number of stages a Challenge Stage can be accessed with a new pattern. The player receives a bonus there based on the number of kills. You start with three lives. A bonus ship is awarded at 20,000 points and then at every 70,000 points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/eyl0dhz3bzxedwoynkik.jpg","releaseYear":1981,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Kiya Overseas Industry","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kingsoft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"TRS-80"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"},{"id":0,"name":"Apple II"},{"id":0,"name":"Commodore PET"},{"id":0,"name":"FM-7"},{"id":0,"name":"Texas Instruments TI-99"}]},{"id":24001,"name":"War Room","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"War Room is a action strategy game set in the Cold War conflict between the United States and Russia, which is escalating into a nuclear showdown.

During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower.
