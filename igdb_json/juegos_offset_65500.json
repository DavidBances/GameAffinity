Star Monomane Shiten-ou is a Nintendo Family Computer life simulation video game that portrays the life of either a musician or a famous performer of the monomane style of Japanese theatre. The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert.\n\nAppeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.\n\nIn the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert.\n\nWhen the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects.\n\nThe dice combination \"A-1\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \"F-5\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/q7wlgsotqk7srcbnuat1.jpg","releaseYear":1990,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Pack-In-Video","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":71120,"name":"System's Twilight","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A shareware puzzle game for early versions of Macintosh, this was a self-published game developed by Andrew Plotkin.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/sutkfrvdxfyouyj2tnrq.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Andrew Plotkin","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":71121,"name":"Dark Woods 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dark Woods 2 is an ASCII-based adventure game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ur5h52n1glpzfaekadgv.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71122,"name":"Where in the U.S.A. is Carmen Sandiego?: Deluxe Edition","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/xdqf79bn9i15l6p88h6x.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71123,"name":"Decisive Battles of WWII: Across the Dnepr","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An expansion pack to the strategy game Decisive Battles of WWII Vol 2: Korsun Pocket.

Each character has his/her own talents and skills. Escape from the prisons using stealth to hide from the guards or bribe your way with some and overpower others.\n\nFriedrich, a cruel dictator, controls his country's people with an iron fist. Now a band of rebels is about to stage a coup to overturn the dictator, but they are found out and thrown into prisons throughout the country. You must now re-unite your rebels and oust Friedrich.\n\nStarting off with one rebel you must infiltrate his prison and move through six different levels helping your comrades escape. Interact with the environment like throwing objects to distract the guards. Sneak past guards because they can hear your loud footsteps if you try to run. Watch out for his \"field of vision\" as you can tell where he is looking. If you knock a guard out he will eventually come to and look for you.

It was later ported to the Atari Jaguar CD by High Voltage Software in 1995, where it was included alongside with Blue Lightning as one of the pack-in games for the peripheral when it launched. It is the first entry in the franchise of the same name.\n\nIn Vid Grid, the players have to resolve and finish a jigsaw puzzle in time as their main objective, before the music video that is being played on the background ends. Conceived by Geffen executive Norman Beil and produced in conjunction with Jasmine Multimedia as a joint-venture, the game was one of the first titles to use Microsoft's Video for Windows multimedia framework, which allowed to play and encode digital video up to a maximum resolution of 320x240 pixels.\n\nThe game includes a total of 10 music videos of different rock genres (including grunge rock from Soundgarden and Nirvana, hard rock from Van Halen and Aerosmith, and heavy metal from Ozzy Osbourne and Metallica). During each puzzle, the video itself is chopped up into a grid and each piece is scrambled. As the video plays, players must reassemble the pieces to its original form. As players progress through the game, each puzzle gets progressively tougher to solve (including larger amounts of pieces, different puzzle requirements, and flipped videos).\n\nThe game received two spin-off titles: Country Vid Grid (for country music videos) and Kid Vid Grid (for cartoons).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1p8u.jpg","releaseYear":1994,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"High Voltage Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Jasmine Multimedia Publishing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Geffen Records","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari Jaguar CD"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari Jaguar"}]},{"id":71298,"name":"Demon Day","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71299,"name":"Snowy: Treasure Hunter 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co75h5.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71300,"name":"PixelShips","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"PixelShips is a side-scrolling 2D shooter consisting of randomly generated levels and missions.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ynhsj1224kmfxww0qqp6.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71301,"name":"Dynomite Deluxe","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dynomite Deluxe is a remastered version of Dynomite; a puzzle shooter released by PopCap Games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qhexxgajvverinfmhufl.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"PopCap Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":71302,"name":"Switchquiz","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71304,"name":"PC Calciatori 2004","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A soccer management simulation.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/guoow4zxl0gjgnybs1sz.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71305,"name":"Exodus Guilty Neos","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A fully voiced port of the PlayStation game, Exodus Guilty.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/k5rfs40qqmntgmzeb9sb.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":71306,"name":"Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Children - Aka no Shou","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Red Book follows Mirai, whose father has disappeared in the demon world, and who is accompanied by the pink bird Veil.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2e50.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Multimedia Intelligence Transfer","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Atlus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"},{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":71307,"name":"Blocks from Hell","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":71308,"name":"WarBreeds","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"WarBreeds is a Real Time Strategy game developed by Red Orb.
