Players control a spirited young ninja as they make their way through a diverse selection of indoor and outdoor locales. The title character is garbed in a blue suit and matching hooded mask, so that only his eyes and his expressive brow are visible to players. The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, avoiding hazards and slicing at enemies. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with the use of cel-shaded graphics, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries.\n\nI-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game. An ultra-cool ninja with major attitude meets extreme sports game play, I-Ninja is the consummate warrior who has spent years mastering his weapons and honing his skills. In true gravity defying game play, I-Ninja can scale buildings, \"shred\" on extreme rails, hover great distances with a \"sword copter\", ride drifting roller spheres and utilize specialized manga-style ninja moves to navigate through each dynamic environment.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jop.jpg","releaseYear":2003,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Zoo Digital","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Argonaut Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":2247,"name":"Savage: The Battle for Newerth","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Savage: The Battle for Newerth was originally released by S2 Games in September 2003 and eventually became freeware 3 years later in September 2006, when the game has been officially abandoned and made open source.

The game involves defeating three monsters and uncovering hidden mysteries. Aside from the three monsters, be aware of various traps and puzzles. Additionally, choices and actions in the game may lead to the death of other companions. Be cautious and think carefully about your actions to understand the consequences. Even if companions die, the story will continue, but the ending may change slightly.\n\nWhile the initial goal is to defeat the three monsters, the objective may shift along the way. You'll eventually discover the truth behind the story. Admittedly, the content may be divisive, especially considering the horror genre with elementary school protagonists.\n\nEncounters are generally non-existent (only occurring during specific events).

The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship.

In addition to riding across real-world locales, players can participate in side events like bus jumping, wheelies, and zipping through tunnels of fire to earn some notoriety and cash for their character.

Seven generic riders are also selectable, bringing the total lineup of characters to 16.

Once unlocked, the eight levels seamlessly connect with one another to form one sprawling environment. Within each region are special events entitled Big Air, Freestyle, Hill Climb, and Race, which typically involve performing as many aerial stunts as possible to outscore the competition.\n\nFreestyle MetalX also features a number of sub-games to add some diversity to the racing action. Players will ride off a cliff to see how many tricks they can perform during their rapid decent, become a human dart while hurling themselves toward an enormous dartboard, and even participate in a game of motocross pinball.

The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.\n\nPuzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen \"steps,\" even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape.

There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths, and weaknesses. As the game develops the characters themselves will develop and grow. What's more, each one has its own unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood while others can cut the lights in the room...Each time you scare a human or 'mortal', you will increase your plasm; the energy you need to scare them in the first place. Scare them too much and people will flee from the building, which will make your job more difficult.Ghost Master uses a unique AI engine, which gives the player a sense of natural human behaviour. The mortals will go about their everyday lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with each other... until they encounter the horrors you control! After facing these horrors they will become irrational, afraid, and sometimes even go insane!
