They simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of safely reaching their home at the end of each level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers, rivers, and many other hazards.\n\nYour task is to rescue the Lemmings across 114 levels of fast-paced puzzling.\nYou are not in direct control of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of roles which can be assigned to an individual Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target of Lemmings to be rescued in order to progress.\n\n'Oh No! More Lemmings' is the follow-up to Lemmings. The game features 100 new levels, and all-new graphics and music. This port features a slightly increased quality in graphics.

This version of the game often featured a border based on the classic Puckman artwork surrounding it. Being based off the original's source code, it is mostly faithful to the arcade version, but a few things were altered in gameplay:\n\nPinky always aims exactly four spaces in front of Pac-Man when in chase mode (in the original, this became four spaces up and four spaces to the left when Pac-Man was facing up, due to a glitch). Inky's behavior has been considerably altered; he exclusively aims for Blinky's position in chase mode.\n\nThe ghosts' eyes will not travel up through the one-way paths when returning to regenerate. When a ghost is sent back to the Ghost Home to regenerate, they will always come back out instantly, even if Pac-Man lost a life on the current round. (Incidentally, this fixes a glitch that can occur in the original where Pac-Man can trap Pinky, Inky, and Clyde in the Ghost Home.). Ghosts will exit the Ghost Home to the right if their target position happens to be there. In the original game, they will only exit to the right if the behavior mode (i.e. scatter, chase, frightened) changes while they are in the Ghost Home.\n\nIf a bonus fruit appears and Pac-Man eats a ghost, the timer that controls how long the fruit stays onscreen halts with everything else.

In case one happens to show up in your home: don’t ask for that poker game. That’s already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.\n\nIf you’re into TV series, then you’ll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan „Riker“ Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid „freezing“ of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.\n\nMultimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, it’s always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The program’s poker skill is mediocre; it’s playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.\n\nReady to join the game? On second thought, maybe you should wait for the fairy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co22y2.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":130839,"name":"Game Box Série Corridas","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co39wi.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Master System/Mark III"}]},{"id":130418,"name":"Worlds.com","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3sry.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":129767,"name":"WinFish 3 - Fly Fishing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"WinFish 3 - Fly Fishing features beautiful 256 Color Graphics and Animation.

The main goal in the maze mini-games is to get to the flag, but each mini-game involves a different way to do so. One is simple movement, one is following arrows, one is a specifically colored path, one involves picking up all the fish food before reaching the flag, and one has X or O spaces on the maze. There are two different puzzles to choose from; a slide puzzle and a jigsaw puzzle. There are bad penguins that should be avoided in both puzzles. There are 4 different matching/memory games to choose from. One is simply matching fish, one is remembering the correct pathways by color, one has you turn the pages of the book to find an object, and one has you match the colored shapes in order. There are 2-3 difficulty levels depending on the mini-game, and it primarily focuses on teaching problem-solving and logic skills.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3zgp.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Pico"}]},{"id":66853,"name":"The Berenstain Bears: A School Day","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Berenstain Bears' A School Day is an Educational game, developed by Realtime Associates and published by Sega, which was released in 1995.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3zga.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Pico"}]},{"id":66851,"name":"Disney's The Lion King: Adventures at Pride Rock","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Disney's The Lion King: Adventures at Pride Rock is based on the 1994 Disney animated film.

Up to four players can play on the same computer with split-screen. Dstroy has no network support.\nIn single-player (called story mode) and cooperative, the player(s) has to defeat all the monsters to advance to the next level. The levels consist of solid blocks, and breakable blocks. The players can break a block by dropping a bomb nearby. The bomb explodes only in vertical and horizontal directions, and any solid block will stop the explosion in that direction. Initially the bomb has a very limited range, and only one bomb can be placed at the same time. However when destroying breakable blocks, power-ups may appear. The most common power-ups is extending the range of your bombs, and the increasing the supply of bombs. Other power-ups include freezing all monsters, gaining increased speed, becoming invisible. Most of these are only temporary.\nDeathmatch has similar rules except that no monsters are present. The objective is to kill all other human players.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4wgo.jpg","releaseYear":1995,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":18852,"name":"Odell Down Under","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Edutainment game that transports players into a thriving coral reef ecosystem.
