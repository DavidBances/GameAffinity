There are five grades of armor, four pulse energy weapons, three missile systems and four engines available when you have enough cash to purchase them. \n \nIn order to succeed, you must master intricate flight dynamics. Learn to maneuver your Lander through a series of traps and other obstacles, all the while handling gravity, wind, and other atmospheric interferences. \n \nThere are 30 increasingly difficult, non-linear single missions covering 15 different planets and moons. In the early stages of the game, they involve finding and retrieving objects with your tractor beam, searching and destroying a specific target or stealing an important object. Later operations take on a covert military flair, some of which are puzzle based, and you find that other factions are determined to stop you at all costs. \n \nTwo multiplayer levels support deathmatch play over IPX or TCP/IP internet connection. CD-Rom and DVD versions were shipped in the same package. The DVD version (Psygnosis’ first release in that format) boasts high-resolution MPEG 2 video sequences and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio.
