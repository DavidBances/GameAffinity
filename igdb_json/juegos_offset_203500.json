When a valid target is onscreen, the player must crouch. While crouched, the ninja magic icon will slowly transform into a a dog head.

For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms.

You must compete with up to 5 other races in colonizing planets, and the near lack of diplomatic interaction in the game pretty much insures that you will need to build defenses early on. Unlike Master of Orion, diplomacy only occurs when an opponent requests peace, but you cannot make such requests yourself.\n\nArmada 2525 offers a fair assortment of ships (approx. 20) and buildings (approx. 15), which can only be built after the appropriate technological advance. One can build research labs which are dedicated to one of eight available scientific fields: weapons, construction, hyperspace, force fields, biotech, planetology, info science, and psycho science. Combat can be controlled to an extent - though you cannot affect the individual actions of ships, you can issue general orders and arrange them into formations.\n\nYour race will start at a predetermined homeworld from which it will expand to colonize new solar systems in the usual 4X quest of exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating of your opponents.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5yvs.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":50273,"name":"Hoyle Official Book of Games: Volume 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Six board games are transformed to the computer screen in the third Hoyle's release.

In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5zaf.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":42115,"name":"Champions Forever Boxing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"It's Ali, Foreman, Frazier, Holmes and Norton -- five of the world's greatest heavyweight boxing champs!

Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked.

The level design is particularly creative, along with a unique charge shot and bombs. It gets its name from the Sanskrit word for \"Flying Machine\", described in Sanskrit Epics. The storyline involves a planet being attacked by seemingly indestructible alien forces that induce fear and insanity to all that oppose them. The last hope for this planet is the Vimana Warriors, two ships that are empowered by the Hindu god Ganesha to defend against the aliens and restore peace to the galaxy.\n\nThe Vimana warriors are the player one and player two ships, each equipped with a shot that charges in the shape of a V. Once the shot is released, the V shape explodes forth in an arc, hitting almost everything in front of it. This sounds like it would be a very powerful weapon, but this leads to Vimana's main problem - none of your attacks ever do enough damage. Even the weakest enemies will take more than a few hits to destroy, even if your weapon is fully powered up. Bombs are similarly underwhelming, consisting of seven balls of light that rotate around your ship and guard you from shots. Once an enemy comes onto screen, a light ball will jump out from the group and crash into the enemy, likely destroying or heavily damaging it. Unlike in Fire Shark, where you can pick up new weapons, Vimana does not offer any weapons other than standard shots, charge shots, and bombs.\n\nVimana has some bits of creativity in its levels. One in particular has moving enemy searchlights, which will fire hard to dodge bullets if it spots you. An interesting boss fires from the bottom of the screen as opposed to the top. Vimana also attempts to squeeze around 50 enemy bullets on screen at once, making it feel like a sort of prototype bullet hell shooter.\n\nVimana was never ported to any home systems, but like Out Zone it would not have really fit onto any of them very well. The music was done by Toshiaki Tomizawa, who would later go on to make soundtracks for Fixeight, another Toaplan shooter and many of Cave's games, including Dodonpachi, Progear, Guwange, and ESP Ra.

The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a \"double KO\" or \"draw game\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.\n\nAfter every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a \"bonus game\" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\n\nLike in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.\n\nStreet Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also \"cancel\" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co55et.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":80089,"name":"Shadow Knights","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As a ninja with a mission to \"redeem Naipusan, the once peaceful land that was destroyed by the northern armies\", you have to defeat the evil Shogun of Death.\n\nShadow Knights is a platform game where you try to complete several levels, such as a village, a cemetery or a castle, before confronting the final boss.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co22yj.jpg","releaseYear":1991,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo CD"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo AES"},{"id":0,"name":"Neo Geo MVS"}]},{"id":48142,"name":"Cowboy Kid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sheriff Sam and Little Chief are coming to town in this delightful western adventure.

It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.\n\nGameplay[edit]\nThe game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Playoffs\". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters.

The gameplay mechanics are extremely similar to TAD Corp.'s earlier machine, Cabal, however this game did not seem to appear as a trackball-controlled variant.\n\nThe player's characters are seen from behind. Some screens feature protective walls (which can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, but a limited number of sticks of dynamite, with which they must fend off enemy troops. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structural features of the screen (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage, reprising the amusing \"victory dance walk\" into the horizon from Cabal. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies.\n\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen or special characters who may run across, such as the small Indian Chief figure or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots. Some power-ups give special weapons with increased firepower, others grant extra dynamite or additional points.
