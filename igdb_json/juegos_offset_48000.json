The characters are controlled with one action button which lets the player perform a spin jump, and a trackball which is used to move the characters around. Each trackball and corresponding action button are color-coded, meaning the blue ones are for Sonic, red ones are for Mighty and yellow ones are for Ray.\n\nThe premise of the game is to reach the end of an isometric course without dying. This objective is similar to other video games in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Yet, it is also different in the sense that instead of a typical platforming game, the game is centered entirely around running as fast as possible on a linear course from a never-ending barrage of threats, including giant boulders, lava flows, rogue gears, falling stalactites, and other traps. When the player is hit by a dangerous obstacle or hazard, they lose health from the Health Gauge, which can be refilled by collecting Rings that found around the arena. Upon completing each level, the game tallies up how many Rings were grabbed. Extra points are also received if over half of the level's Rings were found.\n\nThe game only has a few enemies and one boss that appears midway through the game. At the end of the final level, the player is given twenty seconds to escape from the self-destructing tower. Failure results in an instant Game Over.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1zsw.jpg","releaseYear":1993,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega AM3","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":52141,"name":"SegaSonic Cosmo Fighter","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"SegaSonic Cosmo Fighter Galaxy Patrol is a 2D shoot'em up arcade ride viewed from a top-down perspective.

There is also a regular joystick on the left side of the board that maneuvers the ship which can also tilt the cabinet.\n\nAfter inserting the coin, Sonic gives a speech to the player and hops into the red spaceship which gets launched from the earth's galaxy patrol station into space. Right after, Dr. Eggman appears in a small space pod to deploy bombs and obstacles at Sonic. Destroying bombs and obstacles rewards the player with stars. After arriving at the space station, Eggman will then attack with his space pod by firing projectiles or homing at the Sonic's spaceship after landing one of three hits. If the player defeats Eggman, doctor pulls back and returns with a large, green space armor on his pod. The player has to destroy the homing arms of the space armor before finishing him.\n\nIf the player manages to destroy Eggman's space armor, the player is rewarded with a ship upgrade and Sonic has saved the animal friends while Eggman flies away.
