This package contains thirty missions, fifteen each for the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe, which are set around fictional events leading up to the D-Day landings. The missions are varied. Some of the Allied missions either start or end on a carrier. There are sorties to both attack enemy airfields and defend ships and airfields against attack. On the Luftwaffe side the missions are in many ways the opposite of the RAF missions, attack carriers, intercept bombers etc. Both sides have missions based around a spy called Solitaire with the Luftwaffe trying to prevent his/her escape and the RAF attempting to facilitate it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/b7o4lyjlzpvbsnpe69ir.jpg","releaseYear":2000,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Abacus Software","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":36538,"name":"Six Days in Fallujah","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Six Days in Fallujah (SDiF) is an unreleased historical third-person shooter video game that was developed and left unreleased by Atomic Games.

In 1998, Atari Games re-released the game as part of one machine called Area 51/Maximum Force Duo that also included Area 51, and later ported the game to both the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn game consoles.\n\nLike its predecessor Area 51, Maximum Force is notable for its use of digitized video stored on an on-board hard disk, and the bizarrely contrasting unrealistic gibs into which every enemy blows apart when shot, in exactly the same way. While enemies, innocents, and explosions are 2D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3D.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co40c0.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tantalus Interactive","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mesa Logic","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Perfect Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":36574,"name":"Aeon's Dawn","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A turn-based tactical RPG, focusing on large scale combat.

You will be balancing between building a strong economy and a strong military force, while your choice of ships will also be crucial. Will you try to gain the upper hand by rushing in small, fast ships, in an attempt to cripple the enemy's economy in a hit & run raid, or will you build up your forces silently, ready to unleash long-ranged carriers and cumbersome but powerful and durable battleships onto the enemy? Is investing in a port to repair your ships worth the resources, or are they better spent on more units? Will you firmly take over one island at a time, or will you go straight to the nearest enemy island, striking fast but hard from safety? You can test your strategies against your friends in multiplayer hotseat, or against a simple but very persistent and aggressive AI in noumerous randomly generated island maps, from 16x16 tiles (~5 minutes of play time) to enormous 256x256 tile maps (~2 hours of play time) as best you see fit.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/qhtzfj09b6zewhtvfauq.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":36699,"name":"Neckbeards: Basement Arena","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Put down that skipping rope and gym bag.

However, a few balls can't be picked up and the pattern needs to be remembered,\n\nDuring the last mini game the player gets presented with a panel of buttons. He bounces a ball on those buttons to recreate the pattern from before. He needs to look after a force field which follows the ball's movements - touching it results in losing a life.
