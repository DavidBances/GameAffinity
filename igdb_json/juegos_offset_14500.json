In War Chest, turrets can be improved by upgrading armor, fire rate and damage separately. The enemy AI is improved as well. For example destroying a bridge will cause ground units to take a different path to the toybox. Certain units have the ability to heal nearby units and some will focus on destroying any placed turrets.\n\nBarrages and playable units from Toy Soldiers: Cold War returns with a few changes. Instead of earning killstreaks or destroying a specially marked enemy unit, the game uses a bar that fills up when killing enemy units. When the bar is filled to a certain amount, a special ability can used to call in barrages or spawn a hero unit such a zeppelin that performs a bombing run.\n\nThe game features 4 highly customizable armies (8 in Hall of Fame Edition). Players can choose which turrets to deploy, barrages and modify the hero's arsenal. As the game progresses, new customization options will become available.\n\nThe Hall of Fame Edition features four additional licensed armies based on fictional characters. This includes Duke and Cobra Commander from G.I. Joe, Ezio Auditore da Firenze from Assassin's Creed and He-Man from Masters of the Universe. The characters can be purchased separately or as a bundle on the standard version.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6vhk.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Signal Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ubisoft Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"}]},{"id":15188,"name":"Imperium Galactica","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"We are in the year 2300.

Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.\n\nIn each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired \"location\" it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.Key Features:\n\n18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have\nCopious amounts of monsters and random events, good and bad\nRandom maps.\nSpell system with 42 magic paths\nNetwork or hotseat multiplayer\nTeam play, you can be 2 players against the AI for example.\nStealth and invisibility. Scouts needed to detect stealthy troops, something better (a star spawn or a beast bat will work) needed to detect the invisible ones.\nAssassins that make an assassination attack before combat starts.\nCatapults, Hill Giants and Rocs that can throw or drop boulders during sieges.\nImmortal Liches and Vampires.\nRegenerating trolls rise from the dead if they haven't been killed too badly or their side lost.\nLarge worms that can swallow smaller enemies whole. Swallowed units take a few points of damage from digestion each round until they are freed.\nShape changers that looks like something else when seen by the enemies.\nAnd many many more monsters and abilites....","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3nih.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Illwinter Game Design","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":15304,"name":"Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory is a 2D platformer game that presents the story of a sugar cube.

The source code for Plutos was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware.\n\nPlutos is a vertically oriented space shooter that features gameplay similar to Raiden. The game features six different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Only three of these levels are unique graphically--the other three are just color palette changes. Plutos offers one player as well as two player simultaneous modes, selectable with the left difficulty switch. Plutos also has features a unique weapons power-up system. There are three different types of weapons, each of which can be upgraded up to four times, as well as an invincibility power-up. The three different weapons are: Dual machine guns, spread gun, and energy gun.\n\nA partially compiled version of Plutos was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Plutos was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mc9.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Tynesoft Computer Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Mindscape, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 7800"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Super Famicom"}]},{"id":15344,"name":"Powerdrome","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action.

The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours.\n\nProcedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode.Know Your Neighbors.\nIn Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings.\n\nTailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your ship’s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Void’s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel.\n\nBe the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a ‘good guy’? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed.Intense Active Combat.\nTarget enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship.Take Direct Control Of Your\n\nKinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview; or Mouse Flight-mode, allowing direct control of the ship through mouse movements. Control your battleship’s turrets from a sweeping orbital camera or slip between asteroids in a dogfight while piloting your heavy-fighter using mouse flight mode.

The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).\n\nWith the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement \"That's Galactic Dancin'!\" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a \"secret bonus\" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the \"special bonus\" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.\n\nGalaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a \"Warp Capsule\".\n\nAt the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the \"continue\" option to \"on\", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pol.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco Bandai Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Micomsoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":0,"name":"Sega Game Gear"},{"id":0,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"},{"id":0,"name":"Sharp X68000"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":15536,"name":"Escape from Tarkov","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Escape from Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG/Simulator with MMO features and story-driven walkthrough.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xlq.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Battlestate Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":15537,"name":"Samorost 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Samorost 3 is an exploration adventure and puzzle game from the award-winning creators of Machinarium and Botanicula.

These boxes can spread out in whatever direction is possible to make various shapes and can either be carried or thrown and pushed around. The boxes have various uses, such as allowing players to reach high ledges or cross large gaps, holding down switches, or blocking deadly lasers. Additionally, by hooking these boxes onto a ledge while Qbby is still attached, he can pull himself up.\n\nEach level features one or more crowns, which can be collected with advanced play but will become uncollectable if the player uses too many boxes during a level. These crowns unlock additional worlds as the game progresses. Medals obtained from clearing each level can be spent on extras, such as costumes, technique manuals, and bonus levels.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2595.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"HAL Laboratory","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":15655,"name":"B.C.
