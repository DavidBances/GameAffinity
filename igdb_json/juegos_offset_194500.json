Each of the two sides has a distinct class list, and ranges from the basic (shamans and warriors), to the magical (dragons and golems). In total, 30 different troops are included. In addition, as a powerful wizard, you have the ability to drop game-changing spells on the battlefield, running off a recharging mana bar. By having your troops kill enemies, you will increase in level, which gives you access to the higher-end troops, spells, and research. Your experience is kept between battles in the campaign and skirmishes, opening up new tactics as time goes on. Single-player campaigns for both Draco and Phoenix are included, and previous levels may be replayed at any time. Also, 16 multi-player and skirmish maps are included. Finally, a level editor will let you create your own levels.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Outerbound Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":210110,"name":"Music Quiz","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7258.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":210111,"name":"Muscle Car 76","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6fcl.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":210112,"name":"Milk Pot","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The story follows a day in the life of a futanari girl with various indecent acts she commits in order to temper her uncontrollable sexual urges.
