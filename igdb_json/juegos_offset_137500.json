Once players escape the crude crate the strange, lumbering beasts used for a trap, players journey through sprawling forests, mountains, caves, and swamps, brought to life in a cinematic physical-effects style reminiscent of Jim Henson’s The Dark Crystal, or Hedgehog in the Fog.\n\nThe dreamlike world of Feist is a striking and mesmerizing place, but dangerous AI-controlled enemies keep pushing the players toward their fate. Enemies and traps, without scripted sequences, interact and produce surprising emergent consequences, creating a physics-driven environment with its own rules. The gorgeous, lush backgrounds are brought to life by a haunting and restrained soundtrack.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4c0y.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Bits & Beasts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Finji","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"22nd Century Toys","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":15815,"name":"The Talos Principle: Road to Gehenna","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This substantial expansion consists of four episodes that take experienced players through some of the most advanced and challenging puzzles yet.
