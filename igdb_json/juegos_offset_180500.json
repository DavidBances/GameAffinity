The game had to be completely reimplemented because the code of Anstoss 3 was considered too confused to be able to use it. This, as well as the short development time of only 12 months, meant that the program suffered from a large number of bugs that made it almost unplayable. Furthermore, the text and 3D mode was seen as too weak by the fan base and the manufacturer Ascaron was asked to make significant improvements. The manufacturer decided not to fix the program errors with patches, but rather to bring a new, revised manager onto the market based on Anstoss 4.\n\nAnstoss 4 is therefore considered to be the worst part of the Anstoss series, as it could not shine through playability, realism, or wit. Although the new database system, which now contained 145 countries, to which four leagues could be added, was praised by the manufacturer, it tended to cause very long waiting times, which massively delayed the game.\n\nAnstoss 4 differed from its predecessors not least in that the two main developers Gerald Köhler and Rolf Langenberg left the Ascaron team and switched to the competition from EA Sports to develop the soccer manager series there. Since then, the fan community has also split into two camps.\n\nAscaron was sued by its competitor Electronic Arts for license infringement shortly before the publication of Anstoss 4 and had to crush the entire CD production and change all player names.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2lyb.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ascaron","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":84309,"name":"PlaneShift","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"PlaneShift is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game immersed into a 3D virtual fantasy world, completely made and maintained by volunteers!

Powerups can be picked up while going through the levels (such as missiles, bombs, and energy beams) and the player can use them when the regular projectiles are of little effect against the enemy.\n\nAs each level is played, various enemy ships confront the player, some of them following strict paths, others following the ship itself and others shooting it (with the latest games the player can encounter sub-bosses midway through the level too). On the first game there are eight levels, set on different planets and underground areas, with a boss at the end of each level.\n\nAfter losing all lives, the player is awarded a score and depending on how many enemies killed, how many powerups picked and how many levels the player passed, that score can be placed on the Top Scores page in the game's menu.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nokia","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"}]},{"id":10209,"name":"Space Impact 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"One of the sequels to the game Space Impact for Nokia mobile phones.

Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen.\n\nKlonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack).\n\nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co5b66.jpg","releaseYear":2002,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Namco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":49559,"name":"Chocobo Land: A Game of Dice","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dice de Chocobo is a video game originally released in 1999 for the PlayStation in the Chocobo Collection.
