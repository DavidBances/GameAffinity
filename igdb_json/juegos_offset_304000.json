To kill the enemies Kanu has an unlimited supply of axes (similar to Wonder Boy and Adventure Island) that can be thrown. Other weapons can be acquired by picking up green or blue shields. The green shield gives a mace while the blue shield gives a bolt of magic. Other collectibles include gems that give bonus points and various potions that give increased abilities such as higher jumps, temporary invulnerability, increases fire rate, freeze monsters and provide extra lives.
