Trust us, the stone axe is the shit.\n\nAs players progress, they will be able to acquire new skills and abilities, allowing them to perform a variety of tasks—such as the claiming of land, the construction of buildings and the cultivation of crops—each step forward making the basic task of survival somewhat easier. Having progressed far enough, players will, in time, be able to organize themselves into societies, from simple tribes and villages, progressing through republics, nation states and, ultimately, empires.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co542m.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Seatribe","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":213962,"name":"Pokémon Dreary","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pokémon Dreary tells a short story about a troubled Kanto region.\nJourney through Kanto and uncover mysterious phenomena...\nBut most importantly, get to the Indigo Plateau while you still have the chance.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7k64.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":213963,"name":"UdoRin","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A doujin game by YuuYuutei based on the Touhou Project series.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co53tj.jpg","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"YuuYuutei","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":213964,"name":"Fairy Tower","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Retrieve the missing devices of Fairy Tower to save the world!\n\nSince then the tower has been deep asleep in the fairy village.
