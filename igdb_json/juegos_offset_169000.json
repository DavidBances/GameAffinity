In Gosling it seemed the sun always shined, your neighbors smiled, and the harvests were bountiful. Yes, life in the valley was good. Factor in the mushrooms, and well, life wasn't just good, it was great! \n \nAh yes, the mushrooms. The valley was full of them, and each one was special. There were enormous mushrooms that were used as homes, and small ones that could be brewed into liquor (including everyone's tavern favorite, ShroOOom! ale). Some mushrooms were best buttered and fried, while other mushrooms were typically dried and smoked. There were mushrooms that healed the sick, and even some that could make magic! \n \nThen the troubles began. Bizarre creatures prowled the valley, the wildlife fled, and once full larders laid bare. The citizens of Gosling smiled at each other no more, instead spending their days hiding in terror. Worse, with the blight upon the land the mushrooms that once provided so much now provided so little. Even the casks of ShroOOom! ale were almost dry! \n \nBig Will, an old farmer, sought out the source of the evil. Nestled high in the hills, he found the source: a dank and dark cave that oozed evil, a terrible open sore in the land that spewed forth nightmares. Big Will did not go in, though. He'd let someone else have all the glory. Someone, such as YOU! \n \nYou are Rapius, mighty farm laborer. The blood of the Gods do not flow in your veins. You were not prophesized about a thousand years prior by three blind crones. Yet it is you, Rapius, that will seek out and destroy the source of evil. \n \nRapius, grab your lantern and make haste! For the good of the people, the lands, and the mushrooms - especially the mushrooms! Have you seen what they're charging for a pint of ShroOOm! ale lately? Go forth, descend into the earth! Leave a tramp and come back a scallywag! All of Gosling awaits your triumph - your triumph in the lair of the Medusa! \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa is a single-player, action orientated dungeonbash of unlimited potential. Taking the role of Rapius players fight their way through eighty levels of randomly generated dungeon exploration, braving dozens of unique subterranean dangers in a quest to cleanse the ultimate evil within the catacombs. \n \nDown in the dark players will gain gear, craft items, learn magic, eat 'shrooms, turn to stone, become invisible, get drunk, be hungover, learn to fly, speed up, muscle up, regenerate, smoke fungus, get diseased, get lost, get found, and more! Careful use of Rapius' lantern will allow players to strike from afar, or for tough encounters, sneak by silently in the dark. \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa also comes complete with RAGe, the Random Adventure Game engine. Craft whole new adventures for Rapius, or even make entirely new games! Everything (and we mean everything) can be modded with RAGe, no programming experience necessary! \n \nDo you have what it takes to survive eighty levels of terrible beasts, cruel hazards, and some mind blowing mushrooms?

The Song Magics are still used like programs, but in this tower there are two Song Magic servers: the Sol Marta server and the Infel Phira Server. The Sol Marta server is located in the upper zone of the tower, acting like a stationary satellite. It is collocated with the S. P. U. and Rinkernator and is the main server for the tower. The Infel Phira server is located in a satellite that orbits the sky around the tower and shares its name with said server. The Sol Marta satellite is a relay station used to increase the range of Song Magic usage of the first tower, so it works with the same kind of hymmnos and executes the EXEC variety of hymns. Plus, it also has the function of receiving energy from the first tower and sending it to the second tower.

Each player (2 to 6, computer or human) has an army of particles and a cursor. The objective of the game is to assimilate all enemy particles. The players can only move their cursors and cannot directly control the particles. Each particle follows the shortest path around the obstacles to its team's cursor. A player may have several thousands particles at a time, giving the collection of particles a look of a liquid blob. When a particle moves into a particle from a different team, it will fight and if the opponent particle fails to fight back (it is not moving in the opposite direction) it will eventually be assimilated by its attacker. As particles cannot die but only change teams, the total number of particles on the map remains constant. Since a particle can only fight in one direction at a time (towards its team's cursor), a player that surrounds its opponents will have a distinct advantage. The game ends when one player controls all of the particles or when the time runs out. When the time runs out, the player with the most particles wins.\n\nThere are multiple maps which affect the obstacles in the battlefield. These obstacles may affect the strategies of the game.\n\nLiquid War is a multiplayer game and can be played by up to 6 people on one computer, or over the Internet or a LAN. A single player mode is available in which the opponents are controlled by the computer. The computer AI's \"strategy\" is to constantly choose a random point in the enemy and move its cursor to it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4kb4.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":21835,"name":"Every Extend Extra Extreme","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The chain reaction-based 360 shooter Every Extend Extra Extreme that is an expanded version of the PSP game, Every Extend Extra, which in turn was expanded from a free PC game called Every Extend.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7oyl.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Q Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":230160,"name":"Sonic Smash Brothers","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A flash-based Sonic fighting fangame based on Super Smash Bros. franchise.

The prequel to Quake II, Quake Wars is set in the same science fiction universe as Quake II and Quake 4, with a minimal back-story serving as a prequel to Quake II. It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the Quake series after Quake III Arena.\n\nQuake Wars features similar gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables, asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents. Unlike the previous Enemy Territory games, Quake Wars is a commercial release rather than a free download.\n\nEnemy Territory: Quake Wars received mostly positive reviews upon release, although it received some criticism on consoles.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2o4l.jpg","releaseYear":2007,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Aspyr Media","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Splash Damage","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Underground Development","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"id Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nerve Software, LLC","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":309191,"name":"Deja-Vu!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A small 5-map episode for Quoth.

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game feature an improved game engine with superior graphics and different commentators and are dubbed \"next-generation\" by EA.

On the DS version of the game, Tyldesley is by himself.
