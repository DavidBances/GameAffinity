The land that once was the United States got divided into various mini-states, thanks to a period of conflict known as The Second Civil Wars.\n\nThe 96 governments that formed in its place, raging in size from cities to multiple former states, come in many forms: Some feudal, some neo-liberal, some communist, some tribal, and many theocratic.\n\nYou are in the now renamed District of Artema, a \"solarpunk\" society surrounded by less stable states.\n\nYou play as a refugee, either male or female, assigned to a household of three women, one who lost loved ones in the war, one whose family split apart by war, and one who works in the government. Getting along with your roommates is a major part of the game.\n\nYou can play as the player character from Date Ariane and Something's In The Air, or as the player character from Ariane in Paradise or play as a brand new character.\n\nMany jobs have been automated, limiting jobs to those sectors that can’t be automated, most of which are part time. Finding a job you like is another major part of the game.\n\nThe final act involves a crisis to be averted, but only if you make the right connections and get your roommates to cooperate.\n\nOf course this is also an erotic visual novel, with the usual amounts of satirical comedy, nudity, and sex spread throughout the narrative. As with all my games, I am constantly trying to reinvent the genre.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6ote.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":251071,"name":"Sai","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A short horror game where you play a young girl looking for her parents, she gets lost during a storm and finds herself stuck in a house full in danger.\n\nSolve the puzzles and get her back to her family alive... if you can.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6jti.jpg","releaseYear":2022,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"catowo","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":247839,"name":"Starri","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Starri is a body-controlled rhythm game you can play with just a webcam, no VR required.
