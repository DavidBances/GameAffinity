Once a block is abandoned or destroyed, you will have to remove it and avoid it from making other blocks decay further. Be careful as seeking an utopian neighborhood carelessly, can lead to dystopia.\n\nUnique Modes: Neighborhood designers an enjoy Sandbox Mode and Challenge Mode with modes for Education and Research planned for educational and academic use within the classroom.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/vlgd8s9sdltepdelpg5h.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Plethora Project","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Devolver Digital","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":284175,"name":"A Wizardry Enchantment","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A boys love mobile game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ogz.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Otomedou","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Abracadabra","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":256664,"name":"Bit Heroes Quest","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Bit Heroes Quest: Pixel RPG captures that charm and nostalgia of your favorite RPG games!\n\nExplore and battle your way through a vast open world inspired by your favorite 8-bit & 16-bit dungeon heroes and monsters.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":172634,"name":"LEGO Dimensions: Hermione Granger Fun Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Continue your wizarding adventures in LEGO Dimensions with your very own Hermione Granger Fun Pack.\nBuild and place Hermione on the LEGO Toy Pad to bring her to life in the game where she can cast Wingardium Leviosa to levitate objects and Lumos to light up dark places.\nUnlock the Adventure World to explore locations in Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, and the Battle Arena to play any of the 4 Battle Modes.\nBuild Buckbeak and use his Stomp Attack to smash Silver LEGO bricks, then rebuild him into the Giant Owl and the Fierce Falcon for additional in-game abilities.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3w7w.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":172583,"name":"LEGO Dimensions: Lego City Fun Pack","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Help stop crime in the Lego Dimensions multiverse with Lego City’s Chase McCain.

Unfortunately, on his first day of school, he gets caught up in some sudden trouble, and accidentally breaks an expensive-looking statue.\n\nIn order to compensate for the broken statue, the principal orders him and the boy who caused the incident to work for the school’s “Bureau for the Investigation of Special Affairs.”\n\nWhen they arrive at the Bureau’s headquarters, a room situated in the school’s enormous underground library, a girl is waiting for them there with an apathetic look on her face.\n\nThe girl informs the confused pair of the situation: Magic exists in this school.\n\nWhen the clock tower chimes, the “Realm of Night” appears, and merges with the school building. The Bureau’s job is to take care of the supernatural problems that arise. And so, Michiru struggles to protect the school from troublesome magical items known as “Mists”…\n\nA Clockwork Ley-Line: Zanei no Yoru ga Akeru Toki\n\nMichiru and Ushio continue to spend their days solving problems at Tenbinruri Academy as part of the special investigation office, otherwise known as ‘Tokusa’. One day, a foreign girl named Adelheid came to seek their help in looking for her grandmother’s memento. Along the way, will they find out more about the link between the day and night worlds?\n\nA Clockwork Ley-Line: Asagiri ni Chiru Hana\n\nThis is the third game and finale of UnisonShift Blossom’s magic mystery Ley-Line series. The ‘night world’ crumbled and their students vanished. Mitsuyoshi thought that the cause might have been a fire that happened at the school 20 years ago, and began to investigate this incident in order to reunite with his friend Kotarou who had disappeared as a ‘night school student’. Meanwhile, the school principal who had also vanished secretly planned to bring back the night world from the other side. All of the remaining mysteries of the school will finally be brought to light.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co312a.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Unison Shift: Blossom","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Dramatic Create","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":140164,"name":"End Sleep","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co30t9.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Lilac Soft","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":136649,"name":"War Thunder: Premium Package","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Premium Package includes:\n・ In-game aircraft \"Ki-44-II Otsu\"\n・ Historical campaign \"Pacific War: Japan\"\n・ In-game paid currency 1000 Golden Eagles\n・ In-game currency 120,000 Silver Lions\n・ Premium account 30 days","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9aph.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DMM GAMES","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Gaijin Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":124899,"name":"Expeditions: Viking - Blood-Ice","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Jarl Ragnhildr sent this sword after your father's funeral with her compliments for the way you handled Erlingr's sons.
