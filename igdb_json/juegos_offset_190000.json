The player navigates a lone pre-made protagonist on a top-down overworld, accessing locations represented by icons, similarly to early Ultima games. As opposed to most other RPGs of the time, dungeons are viewed from an overhead perspective as well. In cities and palaces it is possible to talk to people, rest in inns and buy weapons, armor and items in shops.\n\nWhen wandering around in the wilderness or through dungeons, the player character encounters randomly appearing enemies. Combat is turn-based, with the player selecting menu options while fighting. It is possible to attack with the equipped weapon, cast one of the few available spells (using up some of the magic energy), use an item, or try to run. All the battles in the game are exclusively one-on-one. Killing monsters yields experience, and the player character's attributes improve automatically when he levels up.\n\nWith the exception of the final location, the entire game world is theoretically open for exploration from the beginning. However, the enemies become increasingly tough as the player character attempts to move away from the starting town, effectively limiting him to confined areas determined by his level. The hero has limited hit points, loses them when attacked by enemies, and dies when he runs out of them, at which point he is automatically restored in a nearby town. It is possible to save the game only by talking to the king in the initial castle.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co55p3.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Armor Project","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Chunsoft","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bird Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Enix Corporation","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"MSX2"},{"id":0,"name":"MSX"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"}]},{"id":205230,"name":"Dragon Warrior I & II","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Dragon Warrior I & II is an enhanced remake of the first two Dragon Warrior games.\n\nIt has a few modifications to gameplay, but the interface and graphics have been enhanced to be on a par with the 1998 Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6s79.jpg","releaseYear":1999,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Enix Corporation","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tose","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Color"}]},{"id":205231,"name":"Insectoid Descent","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Shoot, slice and blow your way through the relentless swarm in a top-down pixel art world.

At the start of the game an armistice is proposed as well as a union of states through the marriage of Prince Noctis of Lucis and Lady Lunafreya of Tenebrae, a separate nation with limited political power due to the influence of a priestess called the Oracle. The game opens when Noctis, the only playable character, travels with his friends Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto to Accordo where the wedding is to take place.
