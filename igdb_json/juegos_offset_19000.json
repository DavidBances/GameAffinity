The main method of progression is by blackmailing police, the FBI or members of other families, and what the player does or says affects the outcome. While the enforcer's goal is to destroy the other families through brute force, the operator's is to blackmail the police chiefs of the five boroughs by finding enough \"dirt\" on them during missions. The player then blackmails the chiefs, enabling the bribe gauge to fill to the top for free every time the player talks to the chief, effectively allowing the player to take control of the police in that area. The police fight alongside the player's family members and can also arrest or kill rival family members. The path of the operator also grants the player additional tactical abilities that are not open to the enforcer, such as enhanced and regenerating health, the ability to call in the four-man hit squad twice as often, enhanced crew damages and health, ability to plant car bombs and make instant stealth kills, and reduced price on bribing on the police and FBI.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2dwz.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EA Redwood Shores","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":20682,"name":"FIFA Manager 11","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"EA's Soccer/Football Manager game for the 10/11 season.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7xnl.jpg","releaseYear":2010,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Electronic Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bright Future","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":20683,"name":"The Godfather: The Don's Edition","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Fighting","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You can move up the ranks of the Corleone crime family in The Godfather.

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre.

The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2gkj.jpg","releaseYear":2011,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Genki","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Armature Studio","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Konami","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Kojima Productions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Bluepoint Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":20742,"name":"Street Bike: Full Blast HD","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":20743,"name":"Harry Potter for Kinect","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"For the first time, create a witch or wizard character in your likeness that will become part of the gameplay through Kinect's scanning technology.\nExperience unforgettable moments from all eight films - from having your wand choose you at Ollivanders and being Sorted as a first-year student at Hogwarts, to battling You-Know-Who in a climactic wizard battle\nCast spells at your opponents by performing the proper casting maneuvers and calling out spell names utilizing Kinect's controller-free and voice recognition capabilities.\nHone your casting, brewing and duelling skills (among others) in class to unlock even more lessons and challenges\nChallenge a friend in competitive mini-games, or join forces against a mutual opponent in co-op games.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20e9.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"}]},{"id":20744,"name":"Ōkami HD","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Experience the critically acclaimed masterpiece with its renowned Sumi-e ink art style in breathtaking high resolution.

In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' home, she receives a phone call from her mother. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, you must navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother.\n\nThree Fourths Home takes a look into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, and familial obligation.\n\nAs a visual short story, dialogue choice is the primary focus of Three Fourths Home. Between the main game and the epilogue, nearly 800 unique dialogue choices shade the story differently based on how you play. In addition to dialogue choice, you must also keep driving in order to keep the conversation going. Stop, and time slows to a crawl. Kelly has to move forward in order to get home.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27bq.jpg","releaseYear":2015,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"[bracket]games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Digerati Distribution","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"},{"id":0,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}]},{"id":20958,"name":"Fermi's Path","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As a subatomic particle you start a journey into subatomic space!

Players create their characters from over 20,000 possible combinations based on customizable physical features, then select one of six specialized job classes. The game's real-time battles are fast and furious as players can fling enemies skyward, follow them into the air for gravity-defying strikes, then finish off the combo by smacking them clear across the stage. Gameplay is driven forward by story-advancing and optional quests, and up to four players can fight together in online co-op mode.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1qoq.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"XSEED Games","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Game Arts","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"GungHo Online Entertainment, Inc.","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":21009,"name":"Orgarhythm","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Music","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A hybrid rhythm/real-time strategy game through which you direct your own personal army by using the touchscreen to keep the beat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co61ax.jpg","releaseYear":2012,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"ACQUIRE Corp.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Neilo Inc","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"XSEED Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"}]},{"id":21010,"name":"Nike+ Kinect Training","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Get fitter, faster and stronger with Nike+ Kinect Training, a personalized training experience built from the ground up with athletic expertise and inspiration from Nike coupled with powerful and precise technology from Kinect for Xbox 360.
