This newest game is challenging, exciting, and even infuriating, at times. Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.\n\nThe game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.\n\nSounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won’t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it’s game over, and you’ll have to start over again.\n\nChallenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately. Like Gram’s other hits, the gameplay is simple and fun, but earning a spot on the leaderboard and competing with friends provides both a challenge, and a reward.\n\nKey Features\n●  Easy to learn, and fun to master gameplay\n●  Challenge your friend’s high scores, challenge the world\n●  Fun, colorful and engaging graphics\n●  Exciting and addictive\n●  Fun four hours, or just a few minutes","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/w6dbbpbllklgqepny8le.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"}]},{"id":87574,"name":"FarmVille: Tropic Escape","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Escape to an island getaway filled with adventure, mystery, and fun new mini games from the makers of FarmVille, the number one farming franchise!

You will be balancing between building a strong economy and a strong military force, while your choice of ships will also be crucial. Will you try to gain the upper hand by rushing in small, fast ships, in an attempt to cripple the enemy's economy in a hit & run raid, or will you build up your forces silently, ready to unleash long-ranged carriers and cumbersome but powerful and durable battleships onto the enemy? Is investing in a port to repair your ships worth the resources, or are they better spent on more units? Will you firmly take over one island at a time, or will you go straight to the nearest enemy island, striking fast but hard from safety?

It is an unofficial, enhanced remake of Nintendo's Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991), borrowing the art style and overall feeling of the Game Boy Advance game Metroid: Zero Mission (2004). Shortly after the game's release, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting AM2R; download links to the game were removed from its official website, but Guasti said that he still planned to continue working on the game privately. In September 2016, Guasti ended the development of AM2R after he received a DMCA takedown request from Nintendo.\n\nThe game follows Samus Aran, who aims to eradicate the parasitic Metroids from their home planet SR388. It includes several new features, including redone graphics and music, a map system, and new areas and minibosses. The controls were changed to be less \"floaty\", in line with the gameplay of later titles in the series. Video game journalists appreciated the game, frequently calling it impressive and commenting on the improved visuals compared to those of the original Metroid II, although one thought the conditions required to win battles against Metroids were too specific considering how often they occur. The game was nominated for The Game Awards 2016, but was later removed from the nominations page without notice.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4oe6.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"DoctorM64","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":0,"name":"Android"},{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":24949,"name":"Pokémon Uranium","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Pokemon Uranium takes place in the tropical Tandor region, home to over a hundred new and unique species of Pokemon.

Trainers that win the Tournament get a huge prize as well as world wide renown.\n\nYou, a 13-year-old kid from Moki Town, did not set out to become a Pokemon Master. After your mother Lucille died ten years ago in an accident at a nuclear power plant, your father Kellyn, the top Pokemon Ranger in the Tandor Ranger Union, left you with your elderly aunt and departed to travel the region. But now that you are grown up, your aunt can no longer support you. Out of a home, you did what most kids your age do and took up Pokémon training as a means to make a living.\n\nProfessor Bamb'o, regional expert on Pokémon elements, has been looking for a trainer assistant to travel the region and gather specimens of the varied wildlife. You step up to the challenge, along with your rival, a younger boy named Theo. After taking a test and receiving your starter Pokémon, you head towards your first gym challenge in Nowtoch city, and take your first steps exploring the Tandor region.\n\nThings aren't as sunny as they first seem, though. Just when the accident ten years ago had been all but forgotten, new mysteries emerge. A new power plant is built over the site of the old one. Your father begins acting strangely, journeying to the far reaches of the region and questioning whether your mother is really deceased. Sinister Pokemon, corrupted by nuclear radiation, threaten innocent people. In the midst ofthe turmoil, it seems that an impending disaster is looming over Tandor...
