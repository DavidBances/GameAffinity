From Japanese indie developer YOTSUBANE, AdventurePlanningService, this unique top-down shooter is a wild ride you won't want to miss out on.\nYour first step in Crimzon Clover: World Ignition is as simple as choosing how you want to play, and which powerful ship will be yours to command. Choose your difficulty from ARCADE (true to the original arcade game) or NOVICE (better if these are your first step in the world of hardcode SHMUP) then choose your mode from Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.\nOriginal is THE main mode, where you blast your way through stage in search of the last boss. Boost Mode will adjust the difficulty based on how proficient you are at devastating your enemies. Unlimited turns each stage into an intense battlefield of bullets that only the most hardcore players will be able to survive. Time Attack pits you against the clock as you race to make the best score possible in about 3 minutes.\nTake the role of a skilled pilot in the fight to destroy massive waves of enemies while dodging their unending rain of bullets. Each of the three ships has their own style of standard firing and a unique appearance. The firing style is translated beautifully as you amp your way into Break Mode and Double Break Mode! As you blast through your foes in each stage you can collect stars that will raise your score. Each enemy destroyed helps fill your Break Meter, which allows you to wipe the screen with powerful bombs or, if you have the patience, blast off into Break Mode to add a huge boost to your firepower and let you rip through enemies with ease. That's not the extent of your strength though, as having a full Break Meter while in Break Mode will allow you to enter the ultimately destructive Double Break Mode. Watch your enemies crumble in fear as you turn the tide and fill the screen with your own hellacious rain of firepower!\nHaving a tough time to clear the game using no continue? No worries. Hit up the Training screen to set up your own scenario using your choice of mode, ship, stage, and freely customize other variables to practice the fight for survival. Training doesn't seem like a bad idea after you see what the enemies are capable of. Can you pilot your craft through the bullet massacre the enemies have prepared for you?

It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a fallen leader attempting to restore their honor and lead their faction to power in Eastern Europa. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.\nFeatures :\n-Asymmetry: Each player begins the game with different resources (strength, victory points, movement capabilities, and popularity), their choice of several faction-specific abilities, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction’s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game.\n-Strategy: Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player’s individual hidden objective cards, the only elements of luck are encounter cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands and combat cards that give you a temporary boost in combat. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.\n-Engaged Play: Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict, there is no player elimination, nor can units be killed or destroyed.\nEngine Building: Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":2018,"developer":"Asmodee Digital","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"iOS"},{"id":0,"name":"PC"}]},{"id":29427,"name":"Mortal Kombat 3","genre":"Arcade","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/363/363045c496b712600d0ff2dbbae1394c.jpg","description":"","review":"","timePlayed":0.0,"releaseYear":1995,"developer":"Midway Games","platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"SNES"},{"id":0,"name":"Game Gear"},{"id":0,"name":"SEGA Master System"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":0,"name":"PC"},{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy"},{"id":0,"name":"Genesis"}]},{"id":29033,"name":"Jetpac Refuelled","genre":"Platformer","price":0.0,"state":"AVAILABLE","score":0,"imageUrl":"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ddd/ddda5ad6ac893b453dfc6fc2cd1525ff.jpg","description":"Single Player, Xbox LIVE Multiplayer 1-2, 5.1 Surround Sound, HD (High Definition).
