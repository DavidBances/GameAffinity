According to Dave, Sewermania was MB President Jim Shea's favorite game out of all the MBX titles that were in development.\n\nAccording to early promotional material, the generator located in the upper left corner of the screen was intended to flood the sewer and kill all the rats. This would help the player in locating the bomb since there would be no rats to avoid for a few seconds (although the alligator would still be lurking around). In the released version of the game, however, the generator's functionality was removed making it impossible to flood the sewer. According to programmer Dave Landon the reason for the removal was because the game was initially developed for MB's own video game unit before being brought over the TI-99/4A (read the MBX development history by clicking the link in the above Trivia section). The TI-99/4A's cartridges were smaller in size apparently to what Milton Bradley had envisioned for its own system, so to meet memory constraints the functionality of the generators had to be removed.\n\nThis game can be used with Milton Bradley's MBX System (an add-on for the TI-99/4A). The MBX allowed for the use of Voice Recognition, improved Speech Synthesis, a 360° Analog Joystick, and an Action-Input Keypad for video games designed for it.\n\nEaster Egg Alert! At the beginning of the game the phrase \"Dave, find the bomb\" is spoken aloud by the MBX system or the Speech Synthesizer (depending on if you have an MBX system or not). The \"Dave\" being referred to is programmer Dave Landon.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ynvmf3rljyj1bwkuntgb.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Texas Instruments TI-99"}]},{"id":42177,"name":"Sneggit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Sneggit, you control a chicken trying to gather up eggs from the barnyard before the snakes get them!

You take control of a robot who must collect Earth's Energy Crystals that were stolen by \"Computer Controlled Androids\". The uniqueness of the game comes from the fact that not only can you walk up and down the corridors on the bottom of the screen, but also on the sides and top of the screen. Therefore, the game has a 3D aspect to it which makes your mission much harder to complete, especially considering that the controls change accordingly with the different sides of the screen (if you are controlling your robot on the bottom part of the screen all that is needed to move forward is a press \"up\" on the joystick. However, once on the top of the screen, a press \"down\" on the joystick moves you forward). This change of joystick movement helps create a more realistic feel that really helps the game out and makes it more fun to play, however frustrating it may be first. After you have the controls for the game down, which can prove to be very tricky, the next step is to go about completing your mission to get back all the of the Earth's Energy Crystals, which are represented by little red diamonds throughout the 3D maze. However, there are a few curve balls thrown in. If you are unable to collect the crystals after 40 seconds, they become radioactive. This means that if you touch a crystal once it's radioactive (they turn white after becoming so) you will lose a life and fall off into space towards a purple alien ship which appears in the center of the screen. On the other hand, if you do collect all 4 crystals from that round, you might think your job is done, but that's not the case. Even after all the crystals are collected you must still blast the white androids which follow you throughout the maze. Only after all of the androids have been killed will you be able to advance forward. \n \nThe robot you control in the game is also equipped with an electronic vapor gun that will shoot a pulsar beam all the way around the screen which can actually come back and hit you if not careful (and the range of your shot increases as the game progresses, so an accurate hit is necessary later on!). When you do manage to hit one of the androids through they do not simply vanish from the screen, but instead leave behind an energy mass which cannot be passed through by your robot. On later levels when there are many androids roaming about the screen a well planned shot is necessary, because you could actually cage yourself in due to the energy masses. However, there is a way out of a jam if you find that all the crystals have turned radioactive (and therefore cannot be collected) or if you find yourself caged in by energy masses. By the press of a button, you can Beam Up to your yellow ship and then be presented with a fresh board and start all over (but then you lose any crystals you might have managed to collect and the game gets a little harder). One other thing to note about the androids is the fact that they can shoot anti-gravity spray at you, so getting out of the way of their line of fire is another challenge faced on your quest to save the earth. One last little nifty feature of the game is the ability to wear a defensive shield which makes you invincible to anything on the screen. However, the shield can only be used for as long as the red bar on the top of the screen indicates (you actually can take off the shield at any point after putting it on to save the energy bar from being depleted). The shield, and all these other little bonuses tossed into the game, can all be accessed by either the press of the button or by voice recognition if the MBX gaming add-on is attached. All one would need to do in order to activate the shield, for example, would be to simply say \"Shield\" into the microphone! \n \nSpace Bandits is a very interesting game, and has a lot of unique features. However, the mainstream gamer might be turned off a little by the easiness of the first few rounds. At first I wrote this game off as being too easy, but after playing it through to the 5th level I found myself being caged in numerous times by the androids who were out to get the crystals I had collected! So when you give this game a try, play into it a little as the challenge can pick up fairly quickly. In addition, as with all MBX cartridges, this game uses voice recognition and synthesis very well. Being able to speak plain English into a microphone to tell your robot what to do is really a great added dimension to the game. So if you're a space shoot 'em up junkie, you might find all the options available in Space Bandits interesting and entertaining.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Texas Instruments TI-99"}]},{"id":42170,"name":"Story Machine","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Story Machine is a product aimed at children for teaching language skills.\n\nThe product contains animations assigned to key nouns, and verbs.

If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny. \n \nEach level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear. \n \nEach level of game play consists of two phases: \n \n1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. \n \n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. \n \nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Vectrex"}]},{"id":41981,"name":"Mail Plane","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"As far as Vectrex games go, the holy grail for many collectors and gamers is the unreleased flight simulator, Mail Plane.

Local people tell of strange creatures that guard vast treasures hidden within the castle, though since no-one who has dared to venture inside has ever returned it's difficult to know how much is fact and how much speculation.\n\nNot too far away from the castle is a small cottage which you may as well use as your base. Though now uninhabited remains in good repair, cared for by the villagers who regard it as a sort of shrine. With luck you may find there some items that will help you in your quest.\n\nThis program loads in three parts, but all you need to do is place the rewound cassette in your tape deck, then tap RUN/STOP while holding down one of the SHIFT keys. The screen will be blank whilst each section loads -- this is quite normal.\n\nAdventure programs offer you a chance to pit your wits against the ingenuity of the author. By instructing the computer to do things (move, examine objects, take objects etc) you must attempt to score as many points as possible. Points are usually scored for finding treasures and other objects, and sometimes for visiting particular places. Adventures can take months to solve, and so the best programs allow you to save the state of the game on cassette so that you can continue your quest another day.\n\nIf this is your first adventure you should try typing INFO which displays useful information. The computer will understand a wide range of words and phrases, but not absolutely everything that you throw at it. Some words are standard throughout most adventures -- NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, INVENTORY, DROP, TAKE, and SCORE are some of the most common, but you will usually have to experiment to find out just what the computer does understand. And beware, words that are understood in one location may not be understood in another.\n\nQuite complex sentences can be entered, for example, PUT THE RED APPLE IN THE BUCKET. First the program will check that the two objects mentioned are in the room (a room can be any location in the game), then it checks that you're actually holding the APPLE. Whether or not you are holding the BUCKET doesn't matter. It might be that there is more than one BUCKET visible, in which case you should specify the METAL BUCKET, the LARGE BUCKET or whatever. Finally the program will make sure that there is room in the BUCKET for the RED APPLE.\n\nNot all items mentioned in the adventure are objects which can be manipulated. Often they will serve merely to embellish a room description or to give you a hint about the nature of the place that you are in; in this case you will probably be told I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.\n\nAll adventures have mazes.

(North American Philips / Probe 2000, 1983 – unreleased)\n\nThis Colecovision adaptation of the Odyssey2 game (now there’s a phrase you’re never going to see again), based on a less-than-blockbuster-successful series of comics and action figures, adds more depth to the game than the dear old Odyssey ever could’ve managed. But it’s hard to tell how much depth, as the game was never completed.\n\nThe “snake” screen, though it’s much more impressive visually than its counterpart on the Odyssey2, is just plain boring. The O2 edition of Power Lords also forced you to dodge earthbound meteors and an “artificial black hole” within the volcano that could drag you to your doom if you got on a horizontal line of sight with it when it opened. On the Colecovision, all you have to contend with are enemy vehicles and a slow-moving snake. It takes more time than effort to clear this screen, and it’s ultimately a bit boring.\n\nThe other screens, which aren’t even hinted at in the Odyssey2 version of the game, are also a bit tedious – enemy A.I. and combat programming obviously weren’t finished when the game was abandoned. You can exchange fire with your interestingly-animated opponents, but sometimes they just stop firing and disappear. Convenient, sure, but not terribly exciting.\n\n“Probe 2000” was an imprint – akin to Atari’s “Atarisoft” division – opened by North American Philips to release games for hardware other than the Odyssey2, which was by now firmly into its twilight. The only game actually released by Probe 2000 was War Room, programmed by Bob “RoSHa” Harris (who created Killer Bees on the O2). Probe 2000’s next release would’ve been either Power Lords or the impressive RPG Lord Of The Dungeon (which was left in limbo because its battery-backed-up cartridge, capable of saving the player’s position, was an idea that just wouldn’t be practical until the NES era). The intellectual property rights to Pink Panther had been snagged by N.A.P. for the Odyssey2 and other systems, but the only version of that game that has ever surfaced has been an incredibly rare Atari 2600 prototype. N.A.P. ultimately got out of the game business, leaving both the Odyssey2 and Probe 2000 behind.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7mot.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ColecoVision"}]},{"id":40919,"name":"The Yolk's on You","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Yolk's on You was a prototype game developed by 20th Century Fox for the ColecoVision system in 1983.

Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. Enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.\n\nOnce the Sinistar is completely formed, a digitized voice makes various threatening pronouncements, including \"Beware, I live!,\" \"I hunger, coward!,\" \"I am Sinistar!,\" \"Run! Run! Run!,\" \"Beware, coward!\", \"I hunger!,\" \"Run, coward!,\" and a loud roaring sound. The Sinistar has no weapon attacks, but if it contacts the player's ship while it darts about the playfield, the player's ship will be \"eaten\" and destroyed. A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy a fully built Sinistar, although an incomplete Sinistar can be damaged to slow construction. Each short-range Sinibomb automatically targets the Sinistar when fired, but can be intercepted by a collision with an enemy ship, enemy fire, or a planetoid.\n\nThe player moves from one zone to the next each time he defeats the Sinistar. A sequence of four zones repeats continuously after the first zone. Each is named for the most numerous feature of that zone: Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone (the Void Zone is especially difficult because it has very few planetoids). Beginning with the first Worker Zone, a completed but damaged Sinistar can be repaired/rebuilt by the enemy ships by gathering more crystals, extending its \"lifespan\" if the player is unable to kill it quickly.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6o3f.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 5200"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":18582,"name":"Sword & Serpents","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"An early console action RPG with a top-down Gauntlet look.

The flyer may give the impression that it uses an isometric perspective but it uses the same overhead view as the first six Pac-Man titles - and, the player must use a 4-directional joystick to take control of a yellow racer car (the eponymous \"Van-Van Car\"), which is on a mission to burst balloons with its front-mounted spike while watching out for the three \"killer\" cars (which are red, green, and blue, so the last one looks somewhat like an evil version of the car from Namco's Rally-X).\n\nEach normal balloon burst will be worth 200 points, regardless of colour; also, if you press that \"Jump Button\", Van-Van Car will jump into the air, and every time it jumps over one of the killer cars, you will receive 100 points. However, if Van-Van Car should land on one of the killer cars, it will (ironically) be killed just as if it had crashed into one - and when there are only eight balloons left, a \"bonus\" balloon will appear in that maze. Once you burst it, you will receive 500 points for every regular balloon left in that maze (so the maximum amount of points you can receive for doing so is 4000); also, if you burst an \"energy\" (yellow) balloon, Van-Van Car will gain a missile. Once you press the Jump Button while in possession of it, Van-Van Car will fire it - and it will destroy any balloons (and killer cars) it ploughs through, for 200 and 1000 points respectively. It is also not advisable to burst another energy balloon until you have fired the missile as Van-Van Car can only hold one at a time, and the killer cars cannot pass over the balloons and will be forced to go around them; the killer cars will also not chase directly after Van-Van Car immediately and will only do so after a preset number of balloons have been burst or a preset amount of time has passed. Finally, Van-Van Car will start spinning around in a clockwise direction at twice its normal speed when it passes over an oil slick - and even though it loses its jump power, it will quickly be able to get away from the killer cars, especially when they are close behind it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co80kd.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":27234,"name":"51 Terrahawks","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"51 Terrahawks is shoot em up game for Philips Videopac G7000","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1ir9.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"}]},{"id":23199,"name":"Stargunner","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Horizontal space shooter","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1nof.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":22817,"name":"Picnic","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"You call this a picnic!!??

The player starts out at the left edge of the screen but can move around in all directions. To be able to hit the alien the player first has to blast a hole through the three walls. It is made harder by the constant movements of both the rotating walls and the alien.

The player scores points by destroying the walls of the fortress and for hitting the alien. Points are awarded based on the skill level chosen before a game and the player's distance from the edge of the screen.

The game is set on either an unnamed planet or city (depending on platform) where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis's first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Defender was demonstrated in late 1980 and was released in March 1981. It was distributed in Japan by Taito.\n\nDefender was one of the most important titles of the golden age of arcade video games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best-selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry and one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of horizontal scrolling shoot 'em ups. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.\n\nPorts were developed for contemporary game systems, most of them by either Atari, Inc. or its software label for non-Atari platforms, Atarisoft. The 1982 Atari 2600 version was one of the best-selling games for the system and sold over 3 million cartridges.\n\nsource: Wikipedia","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ezw.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 2600"}]},{"id":277245,"name":"Galaxian","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Galaxian is a 1979 fixed shooter arcade video game developed and published by Namco.
