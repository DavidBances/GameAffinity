Everyone in the atmosphere, or has a friend immersed in it will understand. For students:\nThe fear of walking back to their dorms late at night alone.\nThe fear of being followed by a dark presence.\nThe fear of being assigned that psychotic, crazy roommate.\nWe've also tackled the fears of this atmosphere from another angle too. From the perspective of the staff, specifically, the Campus Police Department:\nThe fear of finding strange things on the CCTV system.\nThe fear of patrolling the facilities late at night.\nThe fear of being too-late.In this release you will be receiving three chapters, each with a unique perspective, mechanic and atmosphere to immerse you in the story of West University. Specifically:\n\nChapter Zero: The Story\nAn opening chapter, where you will be introduced and playing Sergeant Thompson, the Night-Watch Commander for the University Police Department. In this chapter you will be patrolling the facilities of West University, while in contact with your rookie police dispatch officer on the hooks. \n\nChapter One: The Oracle\nIn this chapter, you will be introduced and play as Officer Morrison. A Rookie (New-Hire) Police Dispatch Officer who is thrust into a campus atmosphere that has found itself immersed in darkness. You main purpose is to watch those CCTV systems, and patrol the dispatch office from time-to-time, to ensure the safety of all students walking late-night on campus.\n(Each Student has a randomly generated phone number, to ensure that gameplay is never the same everytime.)\n\nChapter Two: The Roommate\nIn this chapter, you will be playing as Ashley Tamon, of whom, you will have already been introduced in Chapter One. Chapter Two: TR takes place weeks prior to Chapters Zero and One. You are returning to your dorm to your foreign-exchange student roommate who may have stolen some of your belongings again. As with any college, young adult, preppy girl, your phone is glued to your hand in this life/death scenario.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":33798,"name":"Diorama No.3 : The Marchland","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Visit a tollbooth where a drop of rain makes the difference between presence and absence of the passerby.

WolfQuest is a wildlife simulation game about wolf ecology. Playing as a two-year-old gray wolf in Yellowstone National Park, you'll learn how to live on your own, finding food, meeting other wolves, and searching for a mate. Ultimately, your goal is to find a home and raise your own family.\n\nYour quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain and eventually takes you across the Lamar Valley to Slough Creek. There, you and your mate will establish a territory and raise a litter of pups: training them, feeding them, defending them against predators, and finally taking them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Ultimately, your success will depend on your ability to ensure the survival of your pack.\n\nPlay the game alone or with friends in on-line multiplayer missions, which now feature the complete pup-raising mission arc. Private multiplayer games feature text and voice chat. Both private and public games have phrase chat.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3nc6.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":33839,"name":"Disastr_Blastr","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Descend into a radical new dimension of abstract minimalist arcade fury in Disastr_Blastr!\nBlaze your merciless path of devastation through an expansive non-linear game world with 100+ stages of cortex-shattering cubic mayhem!","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3on5.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":33840,"name":"Porradaria 2: Pagode of the Night","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Ninja is back!
