It was also ported to the Game Boy Advance under the name Pokémon Gold Version.\n\nThis is a simple platformer, in which the player controls Pikachu. Compared to many other NES games, the controls are inverted, which means that jumping is done by pressing B, and pressing A while moving in a direction makes Pikachu run, and A on its' own clears every enemy on the screen. It's also possible to stomp on enemies, similarly to Super Mario Bros.. Pikachu can take three hits before losing a life, with the number of hits left represented by a Poké Ball counter on the top left corner of the screen. There are a total of four worlds (Velbt, Woods, Tableland, and Motte) which are split into three levels each, as well as a single-screen boss battle at the end of each. This game has a debug mode enabled by default, allowing the player free movement while paused and to skip to the next level by pressing Select. In some places, the player can fall partway into the ground, although this doesn't have any implications. The music also glitches slightly at certain points.\n\nThe background graphics are mostly ripped and slightly modified from Athena and Adventure Island II. Some of the enemies are also taken from various games, with some of them based on Pokémon. The sound engine was taken from Twin Bee, a game published and developed by Konami, and, while the game has a soundtrack of its' own, all the sound effects are still recognizably from Twin Bee - a setup similar to what Super Game and Gamtec used to have.

Imagine dropping a golf ball on a hard floor while looking at it directly from above - and then watching as the ball bounces directly upwards along that straight line of sight.\n\nThere are no flippers or any other traditional elements similar to pinball. Instead the player controls the ball directly. While the bouncing cannot be controlled, the ball can be moved in any of the four cardinal directions. To progress players need to time the bounces on hard surfaces then push in the required direction to pass over bottomless pits and acid/lava pools. Time your movement poorly and the ball will miss connecting with a solid surface and plunge into death, losing the player a life.\n\nThe screen cannot be scrolled horizontally, only vertically. As a result, the levels are like long vertical fields, and some levels are made up of multiple fields which are not directly connected. Later levels also feature warp gates which take you to different parts of that level, or to entirely different vertical fields. Power-ups and score increase items can be collected in the levels.\n\nZenith plays similarly to Bounder and its sequel Re-bounder on 8-bit home computers, albeit with a great sense of depth and speed, and the ability to scroll the screen in reverse.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co73wt.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Philips CD-i"}]},{"id":78574,"name":"ABC Sports Indy Racing","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"ABC Sports Indy Racing is a racing computer game officially licensed by the Indy Racing League.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7778.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":78030,"name":"Wheels on Fire","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Racing","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"WoF is probably the first commercial 3D racing game on the Amiga to use a voxel landscape, the kind of technology first made famous by Comanche on the PC.
