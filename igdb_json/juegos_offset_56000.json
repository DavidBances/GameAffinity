They drop both Pokémon and sandbags. The player moves Ash and May by moving the mouse. Pokémon may drop at different speeds and angles, and if their path hits a screen border, they will bounce off of it. They will also bounce back up in the air if they hit the edge of the tarp.\n\nCatching a Pokémon earns one point, but missing a Pokémon or catching a sandbag causes a deduction of points. Points are represented by Poké Balls that fill a bar on the left-hand side, and will never be negative. Levels 2 and 3 also have time limits.\n\nThe game is won once the player obtains nineteen points.
