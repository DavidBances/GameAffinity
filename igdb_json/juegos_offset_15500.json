It plays a lot like the American board game Connect Four, in which the goal is to line up a series of five tiles horizontally, vertically or diagonally before the other player can do the same. Two players take it in turns to place a single Go tile on the board, attempting to craft their own lines while strategically placing tiles that blocks the opponent from finishing theirs.\n\nWhile the normal board game is simply referred to as \"Gomoku Narabe\" (Five Pieces in a Row, occasionally translated as Gobang), the Renju modifier is an additional rule that makes it harder for the player with the black pieces to win. Because the black player always begins each game (like how the white player always begins each game of Chess), this additional rule is thought to even the playing field. The rule is that the black player will lose if they build a line of six or more pieces: this counts as going \"overlong\" and counts as a loss.\n\nGomoku Narabe Renju is the fourth video game ever released on the Famicom, and the first original game produced for the system (the previous three - Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye - were all ports of arcade games).

Strap yourself in for hardcore gameplay uniquely designed for VR headsets.\n\nTrapped in an abandoned space station, you must race against borrowed time to find your crew before your oxygen supply runs out. As you solve puzzles to open airlocks, locate power cores and disable transmitters, something tells you that you won’t be alone when you finally escape into the universe’s deep infinity.\n\n---\n\nThese are the tenets of deep space society. Detached drops you at the edge of a universe destroyed by human misrule and extortion. Thanks to years of warfare and greed, the human colonies in deep space are no more. The great factions have crumbled; the corrupt corporations have dissolved.\nMost people adhere to the last remaining code of humanity: no killing. But in the lonely expanse of space where resources are low, many are willing to bend the rules to survive.\n\n“Detached will give you tons of freedom in how you play, and the gaming sensation is intense,” says Łukasz Hacura, Creative Director of Anshar Studios, “players of our Early Access release told us exactly what we needed to know to make the game absolutely electrifying for virtual reality headset users.”\n\nDetached isn't just a game; it’s an experience. Unlike many games where VR is a mere expansion, VR is the primary asset of Detached. To complete the game, you must master the controls of your EVA spacesuit and develop your ability to move in a realistic zero-G environment.\n\nPut your skills to the test in both single-player and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer pits you against your friends in an entirely new take on capture the flag. Race against each other to gather the necessary skills and complete your mission. Every second is precious, and every choice you make can mark the difference between life and death.\n\nSingle-player mode makes full use of the VR headset, giving you the chance to interact with the tranquil expanse of space. Beta players have lauded Detached’s sandbox environment that encourages players to enjoy the types of experiences normally only felt by astronauts.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3wp1.jpg","releaseYear":2017,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Anshar Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Oculus Rift"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation VR"}]},{"id":16992,"name":"Human: Fall Flat","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Human: Fall Flat is an open-ended physics based puzzle game in which you take control of builder Bob helping him resolve the mysteries behind his recurring dreams of falling.

The player can control how far onto the playfield the beam advances by releasing the button at the desired height. The player receives one point for each demon and ten points for each diamond successfully shot. Points are multiplied by the distance from the base to the target.

Unlike many other shooting games, gravity plays a fair part in Gravitar: the ship will be pulled slowly to the deadly star in the overworld, and downward in the side-view levels. In the side-view levels, the player has to destroy red bunkers that shoot constantly, and can also use the tractor beam to pick up blue fuel tanks. Once all of the bunkers are destroyed, the planet will blow up, and the player will earn a bonus. Once all planets are destroyed, the player will move onto another solar system.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co31zp.jpg","releaseYear":1982,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":17248,"name":"The Sopranos: Road to Respect","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The Sopranos: Road to Respect is a 2006 video game based on the HBO series The Sopranos, which aired from January 10, 1999 to June 10, 2007.
