The maze consists of numerous ice blocks which Pango can either push around or destroy. The bees are constantly chasing the player throughout the maze and will cause Pango to lose a life if caught. The bees can be eliminated in two ways: they can either be squashed with ice blocks, or if they are near a wall that Pango is kicking the bee will become dazed allowing Pango a short time to squash it.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7ywj.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"}]},{"id":292882,"name":"Venus

You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover.\n\nControls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly. A standard enemy tank is worth 1,000 points when destroyed; a supertank is worth 3,000 points; and the flying saucer is worth 5,000 points. The guided missile is worth 2,000 points when destroyed. Each of these targets can be destroyed with a single shot from the player's tank. One bonus tank (a bonus \"life\" or \"man\") is awarded when the player's score reaches 15,000 points; an additional tank is then awarded at 100,000 points.

Starting at the bottom of some steps, you move around the map searching each room and text tells you what you see and how many turns you have taken.\n\nAs you explore, some rooms will have traps, some will have treasure and others will have a creature or monster that wants to fight you seen from the side. You have a certain level of strength and psionics (magic) and you can either swing at the creature, retreat or use one of four spells which are sleep, teleportation, lighting and fireball. Spells sometimes don't work and can sometimes rebound and hit yourself. You both take it in turns to fight and it is game over if you lose all your strength. You can move your different levels of strength and psionics between each other as you avoid either reaching zero. Another level you have is constitution and this decreases as you explore further into the Halls of Death and so you need to return to the surface to rest.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co81na.jpg","releaseYear":1983,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Commodore C64/128/MAX"}]},{"id":224862,"name":"Help!","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"For Help! you control a guy who swings a mean stick that will knock out snakes that come up from the ground and climb up the vines you can maneuver on.

Black then places a token so that there is now one or more lines (of one or more consecutive white tokens) between the placed token and another black token. These lines can be either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and results in all of those tokens being flipped to black. The same rule applies when white plays to flip black tokens. Players alternate placing single tokens at a time, and must flip a token each turn. Only if no legal move is available can they pass.
