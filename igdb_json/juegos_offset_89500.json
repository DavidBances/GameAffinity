One where even an individual zombie was to be feared, and you needed to search the area for ammo and keys in order to make it out. Along the way you'll also find many documents to read that will slowly reveal the story of what happened at this mansion and what created the monsters in the first place.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co272t.jpg","releaseYear":2018,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Only Human Studios","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":0,"name":"Mac"},{"id":0,"name":"Linux"}]},{"id":97498,"name":"Star Wars Rebels: Chopper Chase","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Chopper chase is a browser game where you play as Chopper and help the rebels crew fix the ship or do other tasks.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ulo.jpg","releaseYear":2021,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":97499,"name":"Bomb Heroes","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":97500,"name":"Pirates of the Caribbean: Tides of War","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Become a pirate captain and embark on exciting adventures across the Caribbean in the world of the renowned Disney franchise with the strategy game Pirates of the Caribbean: Tides of War.
