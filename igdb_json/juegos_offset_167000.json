With gameplay more akin to European-style \"Soccer Manager\" games than the Madden NFL franchise from which it spawned, the original NFL Head Coach generally received lukewarm reviews from critics. But after a one-year hiatus -- during which it presumably did a little TV and work spent some quality time with the family -- the franchise returns with a new focus on depth and realism. Once again the coach's livelihood depends on his approval rating, and everything gamers do, from win/loss record, to going for it on fourth down, to choosing whether to yell at the QB after a bad interception, will affect approval rating.\n\nKey personnel decisions have been given an added sense of urgency with the new Live Event feature, which puts all trade, free agency, coaching, and contract negotiations up against a running timer. As in real life, the draft is the centerpiece of the NFL offseason, and gamers can prepare by scouting players in college all-star games, at the NFL combine, and during pro-day and individual workouts. Meanwhile, players can get running commentary on the lives and college careers of more than 20,000 unique draft prospects from NFL Network personality Adam Schefter. Other additions intended to increase realism include: Non-drafted free agent rookies, 75-man preseason rosters, trades involving future draft picks, a new wear and tear injury system, and 300 new sideline animations.\n\nNFL Head Coach 09's online features allow gamers to upload created plays and download, rate, or view any play available. Two players can also go head-to-head in a quick test of coaching acumen. Offline, gamers can adjust their plays in the middle of a game and save the new formations, or create entire playbooks using the coach clipboard user interface. All created plays can then be exported and used in Madden NFL 09. ~ Christopher Brown, All Game Guide","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4xss.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"EA Orlando","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"EA Sports","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":315138,"name":"The Ballad of Ketinetto","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8r1f.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":276394,"name":"Six Keys","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Caleb must find the six keys by solving the puzzles, then use them to release Tchernobog and escape from the island.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":210677,"name":"Smash Bros.

In the case of most of the sports, however, the game becomes extremely challenging and the AI opponents are much tougher to beat after reaching 900 skill points.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/b0i1r7bcbgragjbwzmi8.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"HB Studios","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"THQ","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"}]},{"id":276473,"name":"Lagoon","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Your mission, should you choose to accept it of course, is to eliminate the scourge from the facility, restore power in the Rosskotek Hydro-Electric station then meet up with \"dude\" in the escape craft waiting for you anchored in the estuary.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":248564,"name":"Top Spin 3","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6gyc.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"PAM Development","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"2K Sports","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":199155,"name":"Retro 4","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Retro 4 is a simple shooter game.

While the console versions of Guitar Hero use a separate guitar-shaped peripheral, Vicarious Visions developed a \"Guitar Grip\" unit that slips into the Game Boy Advance port on the DS or the DS Lite to be used with the games; the Grip is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS. The Guitar Grip provides a strap to hold the game unit while providing the player with four fret buttons; the player uses the fret buttons in combination with using the stylus to simulate strumming on the touch-sensitive screen of the DS. Each game features more than 25 songs, with some variation in track lists depending on the region of release, and multiple single-player modes. The local wi-fi capabilities of the DS are used for multiplayer mode, and allow a player to use songs from one installment of the series in competitive modes with a player with a different installment.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1w9z.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision Publishing Minneapolis Inc.","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Vicarious Visions","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"RedOctane","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo DS"}]},{"id":252149,"name":"I Spy Fun House","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Solve I Spy riddles to earn tickets to a Fun House, a topsy-turvy world where nothing is as it appears!

When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.\n\nThere are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).\n\nThe single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.\n\nToy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game, however, fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2235.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"NOW Production","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Namco Bandai Games","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii U"}]},{"id":272025,"name":"City Full Of Alien Scum","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"New city map that takes place at night","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":271302,"name":"The Parallel Worlds","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A huge and highly detailed base map with a unique twist - it is actually three levels in one, to be played in succession.

The lack of gravity will make the probe keep moving until reverse thrust is given. The player has to shoot Martians and their energy bombs, which will appear in four different spots. The probe can only shoot diagonally. At the start, the Martian bombs are green and have little energy on them. As the game proceeds the bombs turn blue, purple and finally red. The probe can take up to ten hits from green bombs, but only three hits from red bombs. Additionally, the bombs will move faster and when they hit the probe they'll push it away. The probe explodes if it hits the space ship's walls. \n \nThe game has two possible endings. If the player succeeds in defending the Earth for 64 seconds (77 seconds in PAL systems), the laser defense will be finished and Earth will be saved. If the probe gets destroyed before that, the Martians will release their virus bomb and destroy all life on Earth.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1jzf.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"GST Video","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Classic Consoles Center","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Odyssey 2 / Videopac G7000"}]},{"id":257642,"name":"Daymare Town 2","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Point-and-click","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Can you escape the nightmare of a day…again?… In this game we return to the oddities of the daymare town.
