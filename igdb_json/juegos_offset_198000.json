This version of the game often featured a border based on the classic Puckman artwork surrounding it.

Inky's behavior has been considerably altered; he exclusively aims for Blinky's position in chase mode.\n\nThe ghosts' eyes will not travel up through the one-way paths when returning to regenerate. When a ghost is sent back to the Ghost Home to regenerate, they will always come back out instantly, even if Pac-Man lost a life on the current round. (Incidentally, this fixes a glitch that can occur in the original where Pac-Man can trap Pinky, Inky, and Clyde in the Ghost Home.). Ghosts will exit the Ghost Home to the right if their target position happens to be there. In the original game, they will only exit to the right if the behavior mode (i.e. scatter, chase, frightened) changes while they are in the Ghost Home.\n\nIf a bonus fruit appears and Pac-Man eats a ghost, the timer that controls how long the fruit stays onscreen halts with everything else.
