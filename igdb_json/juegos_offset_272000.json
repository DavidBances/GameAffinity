Instead Makkoya created their first traditional RPG, with heavy influences from both Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger. While the graphics at times can even be confused with the former at times, the combat system leans more towards the latter. Enemies are seen on the map at all times, but when the heroes approach them, the game switches into an active turn-based combat mode. It lacks the finesse of its role model and interesting features like the combination techs, though.\n\nThe background story is rather silly: A kid wants to play a video game but get smacked in the head by his mother, so he cries himself into the video game somehow. In a world full of strange anthropomorphic characters, he is Zakato, the robotic warrior, and has to team up with two goddesses to fight an evil godess' threat to world peace. On the quest further allusions to Squaresoft games ensue, like a pseudo mode-7 world map flight mode, although the view is completely static, without the little palette animations that made the dragon ride in Secret of Mana so adorable.\n\nThe game unfortunately is heavy on grinding, especially in the beginning stages, where one has to waste a couple of hours to get into shape so one can even reach the other party members. Worst of all, the game's sequence can easily be glitched, and at one point it's almost easier to force oneself to hours of mindless grinding and end up on the wrong path than finding the right one, only noticing the mistake after suddenly people that aren't there start talking in the cutscenes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yza.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":146531,"name":"Droiyan 2: Absolute Monarch","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yz5.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146512,"name":"Space Mavericks","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Tactical","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Space Mavericks is a game that will bring the classic 2D tactical artillery – Worms/Gunbound – to the new generation.

As the chief architect for the rulers of Egypt, the main objective is to build and maintain houses, temples, workshops and monuments. The main screen shows an isometric view of the terrain, framed by a list of level objectives and the timer at the top and a series of construction tabs at the bottom.\n\nThe timed mode can be selected at the start, with a limit of three days per level, where each \"day\" lasts several minutes in the game. The buildings have to be erected on vacant lots using the resources available. Occasionally, some buildings and lots are offered for sale, and the player has the option of haggling to lower the price. Existing buildings can be destroyed to make room for new ones, or sold for profit.\n\nEvery building requires a specific amount of building materials and a number of workers to be constructed on the lot. There are separate tabs to order more material and train more workers. Each completed building generates tax income every few seconds that can be spent on the necessary resources. New blueprints are gradually made available from the menu at the construction tab.\n\nSome buildings give extra benefits, reducing the cost of materials and training new workers. Tombs attract mummies, that wander around the streets and have to be repelled with the Staff of Anubis, a magical artifact that temporally replaces the cursor. There's a tab for a series of amulets that act like power-ups, aiding the player by giving gold, increasing the workers' speed, upgrading the houses and helping in many other ways.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":146479,"name":"BrainSplode!","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"BrainSplode is a new game from Rust Red Games ( edit: the old name for RichMakeGame ) about rockets and busting some alien brains!

The hero in this game possesses a magical mirror with which he witnesses a duel between his best friend and an unsympathetic aristocrat. After accidentally killing his opponent, he is taken prisoner by the royal guard. The friend now tries to get him freed, but first he has to do a number of quests for the king before his plea will be heard.\n\nThe characters are controlled just like in an RTS or many Western RPGs of that era, for example Baldur's Gate. It's always reccomended to turn on the AI, as manual combat controls are terribly unresponsive. Unfortunately, the gameplay is really slow, and there's not much for the player to do while waiting till the heroes reach the end of a map or kill the inventively designed monsters.

Never mind though, because the shoddy QA makes it very much unplayable. The fact that the installation simply doesn't work on modern systems can be worked around, not so much the many severe bugs like missing background graphics, crashes, broken save games and—worst of all—crucial events that just won't be triggered.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yqo.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146377,"name":"The Story of Atria Land","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yqn.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146373,"name":"LifeLeech","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In LifeLeech player takes control of one of the presented characters and travels the vast game world.

To begin with, the story appears much less stereotypical than before. Three mythical sages seek to bring balance to the world by unleashing the power of an ancient magical artefact, the Jumarion. As they can't seize it themselves, they seek out the help of a mortal mage, who longed for the artifact all his life, and leaves a less than thrustworthy impression. Of all this the young knight Kaien knows nothing when he embarks on his pilgrimage. Rather he has to deal with a bunch of supersticious villainers and an alledgedly cursed little girl with a really strange personality...\n\nFor the first time the prerendered graphics are rather good-looking, though they still appear sterile. The combat system has also been improved greatly and now stands nothing short of the greatest of beat 'em up-esque ARPGs like Terranigma or Story of Thor. Magic has never been a strength of the Corum series. Now some of the spells actually come in form of special moves that have to be executed during combos, making their usage much more natural.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Kaien gathers a party of three characters overall. Rather than fighting at the same time at his side, they're available to the player to switch in between them during the game. It goes without saying that each of them comes with their individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\nUnusual for action RPGs, Corum III comes with a network version. The three playable characters would have suited well for cooperative play, but instead the game offers several arena modes, as well as a dungeon rush. It is a nice extra, but amounts to little more than a gimmick in the end.\n\nThe music is by far the best in the series as well. The game was originally released on three CDs, whith the last one entirely dedicated to the CD-audio sountrack. Did the first two games suffer from a rather small selection of songs available, Corum III got the right tune for every mood.\n\nAltogether, Corum III may be the best single player action RPG ever developed in Korea, and it was a loss for Germany that this was passed for a localization in favor of its still rather unpolished predecessor. This time Japan got more lucky, as Bothtec provided a translated version over there. The most funny and at the same time most sad thing is, Corum III actually made it to the US, yet hardly anyone ever got to play it there as the localization was handled by Gobe Software, then publisher of BeOS. Thus the game was only available for that not exactly widespread operating system.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ygn.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146209,"name":"Corum II: Dark Lord","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A far superior sucessor that introduced many improvements, for example a battle system that actually made sense.

A fact not that easy to understand when having a try at the series' first entry, as it feels quite unpolished.\n\nThe story about a warrior that seeks revenge on the evil lord that has slaughtered his entire village is a beaten horse, but where the game falls flat the most is its action battle system. There's a severe lack of variety, as the hero only knows no offensive moves other than a standard combo and a dash attack. A block button is supposed to bring more depth to the fighting, but it puts the player in a worse situation more often than not, so a combination of evasion and button mashing is always more effective, the incredibly stupid AI takes care of the rest. Even the bosses seem ridiculously easy at first, that is until they switch into near-invincible mode, which requires hours of grinding to even be able to touch them at this state. There are also only three different weapon types, swords, halberds and (utterly useless) bows. Funny enough, there is a bar that recharges in between attacks and determines the strength of the next stroke, much like in Final Fantasy Adventure on the classic Game Boy.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2ygl.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":146198,"name":"Chomper 3D","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":146197,"name":"Mah~Jomino Deluxe","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":146195,"name":"America's Greatest Arcade Hits 3D","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2yhb.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":146194,"name":"Hoyle Card Games 2010","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Card & Board Game","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":146117,"name":"My Little Helper: Spring Cleaning","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This is a collection of mini-games in which players clean up different rooms of a house.

The game's mechanics and progression are similar to some of the Wonder Boy episodes, with slightly more emphasis on \"RPG elements\". It is also text heavy for this kind of game, and pages over pages on a special story book screen are no rarity.\n\nThe game world is divided into seperate areas, but some of the dungeons are huge and map-drawing is almost obligatory. Most of the witch's spells are used to fight the many imaginative enemies, but \"talk\" is a spell too, which results in frequent inconvenient switching in the menu. Without some serious grinding, most enemies are capable to kill the witch fast, resulting in many frustrating game over screens, but at least it is possible to save the game at any time. Yet the function should be handled with care, because it is also possible to save in unwinnable situations.\n\nLittle Witch has enough inspiration and fun ideas to be a very entertaining little game (it even uses pictures as doors to jump through between areas, two years before Super Mario 64), however done by a bunch of university students, the technical execution leaves much to be desired. There's hardly ever been choppier scrolling in a retail game and everything flickers like crazy, making enemies much harder than they need to be and not seldom rendering the game almost unplayable.

However, it can also be labeled as the first to follow the JRPG route a la Dragon Quest, because previous games all either stemmed from Western influences or were action RPGs. \n \nAs one of the many games based on the story of Hong Gildong and thanks to its screentexts kept completely in Han'geul (it even sacrificed the full VGA color palette for a higher resolution to make it more readable, though everything other than the text was just upscaled) in a time when even the wave of Taiwan-localizations had just started to catch some current, it caught a bit of attention. A+ sold 7,000 copies of the game3, which wasn't that bad for a Korean game in 1993, but even then most reviews weren't that favorable because of a number of flaws. \n \nFirst and foremost stands the obfuscated design, that often leaves players not knowing what they are even expected to do. Then there's the overly simple and boring combat system, especially due to the lack of a party, which really limits the tactical depth.

Even in cutscenes, which are zoomed in and show much more detail than the regular game graphics, the 8-bit style is preserved. Only during combat, which is not at all like Ys but held in typical JRPG fashion, the characters are replaced by much more realisticly pixeled sprites. Oddly, only one half of the unusually wide battlefield is displayed at any given time, with the camera scrolling abck and forth during attacks. \n \nThe game design feels equally archaic. The different regions of the game world are accessed in fairly linear order, but it got the same kind of undocumented hidden passages, unspecific aims and inconspicious event triggers as the classics. Other than most 8-bit games, though, enemy encounters can be seen on the map beforehand and therefore be avoided, but once they see the player party, they hunt them down relentlessly.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xj8.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":145592,"name":"Black Sign","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"SRPG by the indie team DreamCard (who previously made the freeware game Moheom Sok-euro I: Ak-ui Geurimja).","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xj6.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":145591,"name":"Morbid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Morbid is a very hard-trying attempt at a horror game, employing all kinds of cinematic thriller techniques, all the while nothing exciting is actually happening.

Development started in 2000 (possibly earlier, in 1999), although references to the game can be found as early as 1998. The name of the game itself is a city, which, according to esotericist literature, resides in the core of planet earth.\n\nIntending to release in 2001, this coincided with SEGA's decision to discontinue the production of the Dreamcast. On January 30 2001, SEGA announced that no more Dreamcast consoles would be manufactured. Games that were already in development at that time were supposed to be brought to completion however. In spite of that announcement, Agartha never reached that state of development. No Cliché stopped development on as per order of SEGA Europe and ceased to exist soon after. Sometime between May 26 and July 22 of 2001.\n\nIn 2008, the website unseen64, dedicated to documenting the history of unreleased video games, created an article about Agartha, documenting the little information that is known about the game. In the comments, one or more developers shared some memories and insights developing the game.\n\nThe website also acquired a clip of 15 minutes very early in-game footage, displaying the eerie mood and the technical and graphical prowess of No Cliché.\n\nIn 2018, an E3 Build was made available online.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xav.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Dreamcast"}]},{"id":145516,"name":"Air Nights","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Air Nights is an unreleased game conceived to be a sequel to Nights into Dreams.
