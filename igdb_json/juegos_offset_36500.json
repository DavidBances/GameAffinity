Gameplay is similar to Space Invaders and Galaxian, but set in a forced perspective angle.\n\nRadar Scope was a commercial failure and created a financial crisis for the subsidiary Nintendo of America. Its president, Minoru Arakawa, pleaded for his father-in-law, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, to send him a new game that could convert and salvage thousands of unsold Radar Scope machines. This prompted the creation of Donkey Kong. Radar Scope is one of the first video game projects for artist Shigeru Miyamoto and for composer Hirokazu Tanaka.\n\nRetrospectively, critics have praised Radar Scope for its gameplay and design being a unique iteration upon the Space Invaders template. One critic labeled it one of Nintendo's most important games because its commercial failure inadvertently led to the creation of Nintendo's mascot character and helped pave the way for the company's entry into the console video game market.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2x41.jpg","releaseYear":1980,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ikegami Tsushinki","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo R&D2","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo R&D2","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39392,"name":"Parallel Turn","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A skiing game with six events: Ski Lift, Slalom, Ski Jump, Biathlon, Dog Sled and Downhill.\n\nBash the buttons to increase your speed.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6udi.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Jaleco","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39393,"name":"Psychic 5","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Platform","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A platform game that allows players to choose between five unique characters.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/lbjvrrtbhsuxd22s7zzs.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39394,"name":"Progear","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Progear is an arcade video game developed by CAVE and published by Capcom on the CPS-2 arcade system board in 2001.

Wells. it is the year 1898 and the Martian have escaped from their dying homeworld to conquer the Earth and take its resources - and the blood of its inhabitants.\n\nTake either side in this epic real-time strategy game. You can play as the Martians with their superior technology and powerful but expensive war machines in their campaign to take over Great Britain and the rest of the world. Or play as the weaker but more numerous Humans to turn back the alien onslaught before their fiendish plans can be made reality.\n\nJeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds is a real-time strategy game. There aren't any set missions or a linear story-line, it's all up to you. You must use your time wisely to build up your forces and production facilities within your sectors before the enemy can launch their attack. Research new technologies, construct new buildings, and build new military units to win the game and save your race. The fate of your species, whether Human or Martian, is on the line.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co61oy.jpg","releaseYear":1984,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"CRL Group PLC","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":39426,"name":"World Class Bowling","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"World Class Bowling is a ten-pin bowling game for up to four players, where you throw the bowl by moving the the trackball forward.

The main weapon is a machine gun that can fire both bullets and missiles. There is no reloading, and it's not possible to run out of ammo completely but if the ammo counter gets too low the firing rate will decrease. Therefore, more ammo has to be collected by destroying ammo crates. Missiles, too, have to be collected by destroying crates. They can however only be used on certain heavy targets, such as helicopters and tanks and when aiming on these the missile will automatically lock on the target and the player only has to launch it by pressing the right button. Fuel can also be collected by hitting fuel drums. If the vehicle's fuel supply is depleted the player will get a score penalty.\n\nThe game can be played by one or two players each controlling a machine gun.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co4xd2.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Sega","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Lockheed Martin","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade"}]},{"id":39429,"name":"Extreme Hunting","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Sport","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A 3D hunting game where players use pump-action rifles to shoot on-screen animals including deer, moose, elk and bears.

At the time the game was created, Exidy had just purchased Fun Games and had a number of cabinets left over from one of Fun's driving games. They used these cabinets to get Robot Bowl into production quickly. The only problem was that the cabinets had a hole in the front where the gas pedal had been. Michael Cooper-Hart suggested that they silk-screen the words 'Ball Return' over the hole.\n\nThe Robot Bowl cocktail was a square box with a perfectly round top.

It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies.
