Man Legends series. It was announced for the Nintendo 3DS on September 29, 2010, during a Nintendo press conference for the 3DS.\n\nThe game was to be directed by Masakuza Eguchi, with Tatsuya Kitabayashi acting as producer. Reo Uratani composed the game's music.\n\nMega Man Legends 3: Prototype Version, known (roughly) as \"Rockman DASH 3: The Prologue! Showing you the Game's Underbelly Version\" in Japan, was an early version of the game that would be available for download in the Nintendo 3DS's eShop. The prototype would have feature playable segments as Barrett and ten missions. It was originally planned to be available upon the launch of the 3DS eShop on June 6, but it was delayed to be improved. Initially, it was said by Capcom that if the Mega Man Legends 3 Prototype Version does not do well upon its release in the eShop, Mega Man Legends 3 may be cancelled, but the Prototype Version was cancelled along with the main game.\n\nOn July 18, 2011, a message was posted in the Devroom announcing the discontinuation of the project. The reason for the cancellation was that \"it was not felt that the Mega Man Legends 3 project met the required criteria\". No further explanation was given, and the Japanese Devroom was closed on August 19.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co305n.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}]},{"id":78001,"name":"Advanced NetWars","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":77984,"name":"R.I.P.","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Sin descripción","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":77979,"name":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2: 2011 - Final Assault","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Part two of the Ghost Recon 2 trilogy.

Join a diverse cast of characters to stave off the looming calamity... or unwittingly hasten its arrival! In Bevontule, you'll traverse a massive landscape inhabited by war-ravaged nations, rebel factions, ferocious beasts - and far more insidious and unknowable forces. You'll explore expansive plains, aid survivors in ruined towns, delve deeply into caverns, and navigate forbidden ruins - all in the service of discovering the existential threat presently posed to Onich and perhaps humanity itself.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2mc4.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":76981,"name":"South Park 201 - Quizner's Trivia","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Quiz/Trivia","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"South Park 201 - Quizner's Trivia for the iPhone","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ftcxv0snpswfenhgkloy.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":76979,"name":"Hard Corps","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This canceled military-vehicle shooter game was shown in the line-up titles during the PSP's debut at E3 2004.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7234.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}]},{"id":76976,"name":"SAT Prep Math 2008","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Study for the SAT test on your iPod","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/nqmcdmnmpco2dl0bgwvn.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":76969,"name":"The Clique: Queen Teen","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In Queen Teen: The Clique players assume the role of the new girl at school, taking on the challenges of climbing the social ladder to join the ultimate clique, the Pretty Committee.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[]},{"id":76968,"name":"The King of Fighters Online","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Developed by Triple A Games, along with Korean company Dragonfly, KOF ONLINE is a MOBA game featuring 3D graphics, online RPG elements, and of course fighting.
