Those students who are capable and work hard to improve the learning environment would receive various benefits. Also, it seemed that the one with the top results would get a special privilege.\n\nRen returned to Sakumo ward after a long time away and transferred into the school, reuniting with his timid little sister Karin and childhood friend Shiina, who had grown up to be very beautiful. On his first day at school, he was caught up in some trouble and ended up saving a girl. The girl Asuha asked him to join her club, aim for ALIA and change the school.

In it, you control main character Merit, who travels through an enormous 3000-room labyrinth, the Orcus Dome, in order to find three artifacts called the PSI Keys, and restore them to their proper locations. \n \nAlthough enemies fire copious amounts of bullets at you, you don't shoot back- instead, you have an attack called a PSI Circuit, which you charge up to unleash a shockwave that hits enemies and nullifies their shots. As you charge up the PSI Circuit, target reticules appear on nearby enemies, the circle indicating they're in range, and the cross indicating you've charged up enough to damage or kill them. You can't just use the PSI Circuit as often as you want, though. After releasing it, there's a cooldown time before you can charge up again, and the longer you charge up, the longer you have to wait. Destroyed enemies leave behind PSI crystals you can use to upgrade three facets of your PSI Circuit- Circuit Charge (charge up faster), Circuit Refill (less cooldown time), and Reflect Shields. When you have at least one level in Shields, a barrier is projected around Merit, which will deflect one bullet per shield level, before having to regenerate. As you upgrade Shields, the barrier becomes bigger, then shows multiple layers as it gets stronger.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/zkameytcg0na8alfswsp.jpg","releaseYear":2008,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Lancer-X/ASCEAI","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":78480,"name":"Incubation: The Wilderness Missions","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Incubation: The Wilderness Missions is Blue Byte Software's official expansion pack for Incubation: Time Is Running Out.

Players control a silver ball, akin to a pinball, with a viewpoint looking directly down on the ball from above. Unlike pinball, where the ball falls vertically in front of the player, in Zenith continuously bounces towards and away from the player viewpoint. Imagine dropping a golf ball on a hard floor while looking at it directly from above - and then watching as the ball bounces directly upwards along that straight line of sight.\n\nThere are no flippers or any other traditional elements similar to pinball. Instead the player controls the ball directly. While the bouncing cannot be controlled, the ball can be moved in any of the four cardinal directions. To progress players need to time the bounces on hard surfaces then push in the required direction to pass over bottomless pits and acid/lava pools. Time your movement poorly and the ball will miss connecting with a solid surface and plunge into death, losing the player a life.\n\nThe screen cannot be scrolled horizontally, only vertically. As a result, the levels are like long vertical fields, and some levels are made up of multiple fields which are not directly connected. Later levels also feature warp gates which take you to different parts of that level, or to entirely different vertical fields. Power-ups and score increase items can be collected in the levels.\n\nZenith plays similarly to Bounder and its sequel Re-bounder on 8-bit home computers, albeit with a great sense of depth and speed, and the ability to scroll the screen in reverse.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co73wt.jpg","releaseYear":1997,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Philips CD-i"}]},{"id":78724,"name":"The 4th Unit","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Visual Novel","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"First entry in the 4th Unit franchise.\nYuusuke, a common boy back from school, finds a naked girl in the forest while searching for his hidden bike.
