You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners!\n\nThe main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too. This allows the player to actually see bullets coming his way and in result avoid them. Even though the player can activate and deactivate Divine Focus whenever he wants, the ability has its limits. To refill its resource, the player needs to kill at least one enemy, without Divine Focus being activated.\n\nAnother feature important for how the gameplay evolves is a One Mistake rule which is really simple in its assumptions. Each hit is fatal for the main protagonist and means the game is over for the player.\n\nThe main reason behind introducing those two mechanics to the game, was to give players the opportunity to experience the joy of a pure, hardcore gameplay, with no place for mistakes.

While some world types are based on the classic tree on dirt others are designed with unique recipes and advancements.\n\nWhat makes this version different from every other SkyFactory before it? We've completely redesigned the resource gathering. Sieving for resources are a thing of the past. For a more immersive experience, Sky Orchards has been introduced. Resource Trees provides a built-in progression system and lets the player choose the resources they want to produce rather than a randomized system. We've removed the achievement book and replaced it with the advancement system. Instead of requiring players to manually check out what they've accomplished, the game will keep track for you. This system isn't designed to create a required questing system, but rather an optional set of goals for players looking for ideas on what to do next.\n\nSkyFactory 4 introduces the prestige system! This is a completely optional game mode allowing you to unlock mods, items, and mechanics through an open progression system. Prestige points and unlocks are global and can be brought with you to other worlds! Prestige points can be gained by finishing advancements or by using the Parabox, a time-traveling box that generates points.
