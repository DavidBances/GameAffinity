The players takes control of a space-fighter equipped with a front laser gun and ground bombs. Although the game features power-ups, they follow an unusual and unique formula - tiles on the ground must be destroyed in order to upgrade the main weapon or trigger special events. However, three of these tiles must be destroyed to activate such power-ups - B creates a temporary barrier around the ship,P upgrades the primary weapon and L gives the player an extra bonus at the end of each stage. Another interesting twist to the game is the Uoru armor; a shadow sometimes appear on the ground and if the player aligns his own shadow with it, then the ship transforms into a powerful robot for a short amount of time. Each stage ends with the same boss battle; a large Mega Argus fortress with a slow flashing core at its center, and the only way to destroy this pernicious mothership is to bomb its core when it is fully exposed. After the boss is taken care of, the player must successfully land on a runway and be cautious not to crash the ship.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety. By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7o2j.jpg","releaseYear":1986,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Atlus","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System"},{"id":0,"name":"Family Computer"}]},{"id":273037,"name":"Arkanoid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Amstrad CPC Port of Arkanoid.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9ct5.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Ocean Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Imagine Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Probe Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Amstrad CPC"}]},{"id":273038,"name":"Arkanoid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Atari 8-bit port of Arkanoid.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9f7j.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Imagine Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ocean","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari 8-bit"}]},{"id":273039,"name":"Arkanoid","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Arcade","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"ZX Specturm port of Arkanoid.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co9f7q.jpg","releaseYear":1987,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Taito","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Imagine Software","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Ocean","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"ZX Spectrum"}]},{"id":273041,"name":"9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Real Time Strategy (RTS)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Unleash voxel warfare in 9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far.

Once you have all three of them, you must use them to open a gate beyond which lies your final challenge.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7a0t.jpg","releaseYear":2019,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":273547,"name":"Nevasca","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Nevasca is an episode-format wad for zdoom source port, focusing on snow themes among with some ruins, hellish or techbase variants.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7a0v.jpg","releaseYear":2016,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":273548,"name":"Twisted Joke","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"A Doom 2006 advent calendar map made by James \"Phobus\" Cresswell.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":273549,"name":"Smothered Hope","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Single-player, Boom compatible map","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2014,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":273550,"name":"Holoemblem: The Search for Seiso","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Turn-based strategy (TBS)","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Indie","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"HoloEmblem: The Search for Seiso is a Hololive fan game and rom hack of Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones made with FEBuilder.\n\nThe game has 56 playable characters across 40 chapters, 10 are optional, in a unique story with in-game cutscenes.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7a0x.jpg","releaseYear":-1,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}]},{"id":273551,"name":"Wicked Be The Ways of Men","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Shooter","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This map is different from most other maps in that the player progresses differently through the map depending on the skill level.
