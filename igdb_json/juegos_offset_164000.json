The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 on March 29, 2009 and on PlayStation 2 on April 14, 2009, with an Australian and European release in May 2009. Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.\n\nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc.\n\nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wni.jpg","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Activision","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Budcat Creations","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Neversoft Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":0,"name":"Wii"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":0,"name":"PlayStation 3"}]},{"id":315227,"name":"Dead Space: Flash","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"2D Flash fangame based off the Dead Space series.","imageUrl":"Sin imagen","releaseYear":2009,"developers":[],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Web browser"}]},{"id":21114,"name":"You, Me, and the Cubes","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Puzzle","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Brainchild of the mad genius Kenji Eno, You, Me, and the Cubes is a game of balance and physics.

First, there is arcade mode, which pits the player against seven randomly-selected characters in order.

Last is the free battle mode, where the player can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play.\n\nThe game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves. In addition to regular moves, each character also has special super moves, which require use of a special bar which fills as the player lands blows. The player also unlocks assist characters as the game is played, which can be assigned to characters to give special assist moves.\n\nThere is also a database mode where the player can read introductions for each of the playable and assist characters.

It is also included on the Region 2 DVD and Blu-ray releases of A Matter of Loaf and Death as DVD-ROM content.
