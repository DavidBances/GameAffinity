The key to success lies in good planning by season, expert knowledge that you acquire throughout the game, and skill and good old-fashioned hard work. As a farmer, the player learns to live with the forces of nature, accept the weather and respond so as to perfect the yield from fields, care for the animals and prepare the budget for new investments. Many tractors and farm machines (combine harvesters, field choppers, attaching parts and trailers, etc.) by renowned manufacturers are available to cultivate the farm and manage all the work. Only good planning and hard work will turn fallow earth into a flourishing and fertile soil. Of course, you can drive and control all machines yourself, be it hooking up the plough, re-filling the tractor or unloading the harvest.\n\n\"Professional Farmer 2014\" has a broad variety of crops, depending on the environment and climate, with which the farmer can cultivate the fields diversely, effectively and with a high yield. Even crop rotation plays an important role in planning! The integrated seasons influence the game and provide the player with a constant stream of tasks and jobs.\n\nThe local farmers market is your first stepping-stone to success! After just a short time, you should take our home grown and harvested produce to the market and earn your first money by selling it. As you sell more, you will soon see more and larger machines in your fleet and be able to grow larger quantities of produce.

Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.[1][2]\n\nThe game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This took the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and required the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game involved the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay was further enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state. The game was further noted by Amiga Action as having an innovative 'advance through time' feature, allowing the player some control over the rate at which time passed in the game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/wyygzodgopgfztnhj8l1.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Silmarils","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":10854,"name":"Xyphoes Fantasy","genres":[],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"In the land of Norem, an army of warriors called the Skulls have caused a magician to lose all of his powers.

In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.\n\nMost of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2jiz.jpg","releaseYear":1992,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Silmarils","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"DOS"},{"id":0,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":0,"name":"Amiga"}]},{"id":10857,"name":"Transarctica","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Strategy","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"The story is based on a post-apocalyptic science fiction saga La Compagnie des Glaces (The Ice Company) written by Georges-Jean Arnaud and the comic strip Le Transperceneige (The Snowpiercer) by Jacques Lob. \n \nIn the 21st century, mankind is being ravaged by the greenhouse effect.
