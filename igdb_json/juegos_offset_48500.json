During their last quest, they messed up with the time machine and as a result landed with the entire village Gadjukino in the middle of modern United States of America. Captain Furmanov is now a mormon priest, the sexy Anka works for FBI, and VICH and Petka have to save the world again. They'll face criminals in Las Vegas, travel to jungles in Central America, fight Saddam Hussein, and even visit Alaska in this traditional point-and-click 2D adventure game.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ocghmub0aeshjtny1xw5.jpg","releaseYear":2001,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Saturn Plus","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Buka Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":52758,"name":"Red Comrades 4: Independence Day","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Another chapter in the popular Russian graphic adventure series, based on Soviet folklore humor.

It appears that in the time of the king Ivan the Terrible (16th century), those aliens helped him to conquer the Tatar city Kazan.

This time, the two unlikely heroes are being used as pawns in a grand scheme by a mysterious mastermind named Kotovsky and his even more mysterious \"behind-the-scenes\" boss, who want to change the political face of Russia forever. Will Petka and his mentor be able to thwart the danger and save their homeland once again?..\n\nNot much has changed in this installment; as all the previous games in the series, Konec Igry (\"End of the Game\") is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, with 2D cartoon-like character graphics and backgrounds. The gameplay mostly revolves around talking to characters, gathering information, and solving puzzles mostly through manipulation of inventory items.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/uai1xopuqamepsuuabkl.jpg","releaseYear":2004,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Saturn Plus","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Buka Entertainment","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":52760,"name":"Petka 6: Novaya Realnost","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Novaya Realnost means \"New Reality\" in Russian; and indeed, the two heroes of the long-running series, Vasilij Ivanovich Chapaev and his young assistant Petka (real historical figures who participated in the Russian civil war of 1918, but became the focus of countless jokes during the Soviet period) have to become a part of something they have not encountered before: the battle between the forces of Light and Darkness!.. And to think that it all started only because the two wanted to drink some beer... one event led to another, and in the end the heroes have to face ultimate evil in a scenario that is in many ways a parody on the famed Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of the previous games in the series, being a traditional puzzle-solving adventure. This time, branching dialogue and logical puzzles have a more prominent place, along with the typical inventory-based tasks. Graphical style has changed, for the first time in the series: the backgrounds are pre-rendered instead of hand-drawn 2D, and character models are now three-dimensional.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/jc9xtwmqfqwtjdjhy1ds.jpg","releaseYear":2005,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Buka Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Saturn Plus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":52761,"name":"Petka 007: Zoloto Partii","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"This installment in the long-running Russian series begins with the titular Petka and his commander, Vassilij Ivanovich Chapaev, on a ship with their comrade Furmanov (reminiscence of a popular story from the times of the Russian civil war of 1918).

The ship collides with Hugh Hefner's motorboat. Chapaev is unconscious, and Petka realizes that the future once again depends only on him...\n\nLike the previous games in the series, Zoloto Partii (\"The Gold of the Party\") is a puzzle-solving adventure, mainly focusing on inventory-based puzzles. Graphically, it follows the template introduced in the previous game. The title and the setting are an obvious parody on James Bond; but the game also pays homage to Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail, also the seventh installment in the famous humorous adventure game series; like Love for Sail, it is set on a ship, and revolves around \"pleasing\" young sexy women.","imageUrl":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/bdaiqgfhtmt58xp70wmq.jpg","releaseYear":2006,"developers":[{"id":0,"name":"Buka Entertainment","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Saturn Plus","games":null}],"libraryGames":null,"platforms":[{"id":0,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}]},{"id":52762,"name":"Petka 8: Pokorenie Rima","genres":[{"id":0,"name":"Adventure","games":null},{"id":0,"name":"Simulator","games":null}],"avg_score":0.0,"description":"Petka 8: Pokorenie Rima is another part of one of the most famous Russian quest series.\nA hero of Russian communist revolution and many funny stories as well Vasily Ivanovich Chapaev with his silly henchman Petka and the most sexy girl in the village Anka the machine-gunner are into some adventures again.

This time, the trio receives an assignment to travel to the year 2150! It appears that in 2008, the USA and other countries decided to use Russia as a dumping ground for garbage.
