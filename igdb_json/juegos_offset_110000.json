Whether as part of the purchase of \"technology\" or building your own production line. I also think a lot about the introduction of the logistics module. It would be naturally connected to the warehouse. This would allow the introduction of delivery elements to the game. Purchase of delivery vehicles and possible plans for the supply stores. And that would probably be my biggest ideas for adding content. In the meantime, I will want to add new minor functions and improvements like a bank and other smaller features whcih will balance gameplay.\n\nA Few Words From the Author\nBy creating Bakery Biz Tycoon, my main goal was to create a title that will relate to old school tycoon games. In which the player has to focus more on the macro of managing the enterprise than on micro-management or time management. I tried to create a more complex production than typical Time Management games, but simple enough for the time spent with Bakery Biz Tycoon to be fun. And I wish all this and I hope that my first game will give you at least a few hours of pleasant gameplay.

But also everything is made out of guns and bullets and stuff. Like, everything.\n\nHotline Milwaukee\nBrutal, fast-paced, stealth action and a whole lot of blood. From your garbage person apartment in historically interesting and relevant Milwaukee, pick up the phone, and answer the call--of murder. Follow instructions and follow the stairs deeper and deeper into the mysterious basement. Where does it go? Who are you?\n\nApe Out Jr.\nEscape out of ape prison in this classic arcade-style platformer where you play as an orange gorilla who will kill everyone so he can to see his dad again. Grab unsuspecting guards to use as weapons and shields in this completely original idea set to an interpretive chiptune jazz drummer soundtrack. Please, Ape Out was my father’s name.\n\nShootyboots\nIt’s the never-ending story of a young boy falling down a well, wearing a giant boot as if it was overalls, which also is a gun. Collect gems, squash and shoot the fauna, fall deeper into the infinite well, and wear some other equally large and ballistically designed shoes.\n\nSuper Absolver Mini: Turbo Fighting Championship\n(2 Players Only)\nA competitive fighting game where you play as your choice of one of four masked combat disciples. You choose two special moves. You fight two rounds. The winner is absolved of the obligation to ever have to fight again, but probably will anyway because the one true resolve of the flesh is a fist colliding with it.\n\nCatsylvania\nIt’s a cat inside of a suit of armor. It’s a cat...In full plate armor. What else do you want?\n\nPikuBiku Ball Stars\n(2 Players Only)\nEverybody’s favorite red thing with legs is back and ready to sink some baskets with a friend.

And please, leave me your comments and suggestions and concerns. For me they are fundamental, so that together we can give shape to this project and improve it day by day.\nHaving said that, I tell you a little about this project that I have started to develop with a lot of love because it brings together my two great hobbies, 3D design and writing. This graphic novel, seeks to tell the story and adventures of Bennett and the inhabitants of the village of Nemerion and their relationships, and season them with a little sex. At the moment there are 12 characters in total, most of them appear in the first chapter and some in the following chapters. I don't want to tell you much, I would like you to discover it...\nI wish to think that the novel has a balance, between History, dialogue and Sexual content, I know that it is something difficult to achieve, but I would like to be able to maintain this balance throughout the novel, and I hope that you with your comments, tell me what you think, as well as if it lacks or has more than one characteristic in particular. Although I already have a definite idea of where the novel will go and its stories, I would love to improve it together even more, 2 heads think more than 1 hahaha.\nMy plan at the moment is to be able to publish a chapter per month (if my current work allows it, since I mainly dedicate a little time every night, when I come back from work, and on weekends, as much as I can). Each month I will be improving aspects of the game, as well as developing in depth the personality and history of each character of the novel. Right now the bottleneck is given with the PC I work with, which does not allow me to render the images of the novel (it takes me an average time of 12 Hs each image, which makes it infeasible to do the work of rendering with my current PC), I can only do the layout of the images, thanks to the help of two Friends: Miguel and Gonzalo (thanks guys), who lent me their Pc's, remotely I do the work of rendering, and thus the whole project has begun to come to life. From now on my short term objective is to be able to change the PC in order to be able to make the rendering work faster and to be able to have a better quality in the images and videos of the novel.\nAs for the novel itself, I have the idea of being able to add in the lapse of the first 3 chapters:\n● An inventory, which will allow Bennett's interactions with the other characters as well as with the environment itself to be expanded.\n● A map of the village, and with it the possibility of moving freely through the village.\n● A character card, which will collect and show all the attributes of Bennett (Sexual Orientation, exploits, memories. Etc)\n● A Personal Diary of Bennett, which will show and detail our relationships with the rest of the characters in the novel\n● Videos, this point depends exclusively on whether I can change my PC, but it is something that I would like to include (I already have a video layout, but for the rendering times, I am unable to create it).\nAnd in the long run, I would like to add: Predefined Missions and Adventures that directly impact the development of Bennett's history. And to be able to launch the novel also for cell phones.\nFinal words: I hope with all my heart that you like this project and everyone can enjoy it as I am enjoying doing it, so I have decided that EVERYONE can enjoy this novel without paying. But I'm not going to lie to you: I also would like to be able to get some money, or at least to be able to recover the invested one, clearly I´m not trying to get rich with this project, only to be able to recover some of the money spend. Some things, like the textures of the 3D models, the storage in the cloud to render the images remotely, or the translation of the texts (I am from Argentina and English is not my native language), have a cost, and from my heart I tell you that it is worth every penny spent on this novel, but of course, it wouldn´t be bad if I can recover some of the money spent hahaha. Just say goodbye to you with a big hug and thank you for being part of this project which is so important to me.

Besides the German league of the season 1991/1992 (with 18 instead of the real 20 teams) there are also a few fictional scenarios available, e.g. one in which first and return match are directly behind each other or a world league with national teams. \n \nDuring the game, the player has the usual options to choose from, e.g. lineup, tactics, training camps, transfer market, expanding the stadium or merchandising. The strength of an athlete is calculated from the factors position (how well he can play on the position he has to play), shape (if and how well he played in the past) and energy (physical shape). After each season the manager has to have a certain amount of money on the club's account (how much depends on the chosen difficulty level) in order to avoid being fired. The game also rates the manager's performance which is mostly interesting when multiple players are participating.
