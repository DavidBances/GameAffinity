You’re probably here because you’re looking for a fun hack of Super Mario Bros, right? If so, Super Mario Bros HF could be just for you. Perhaps the main focus of SMBHF is the difficulty. Most hacks that redo levels (at least the ones that I’ve tried) make the game nearly impossible! I’ve had quite a few games where I couldn’t get past the first few levels without savestates. In my opinion, games like these are just not fun. How can you enjoy a game if you have to keep saving after each major jump? I don’t think you can.\n\nThat is why SMBHF’s levels are about as difficult as the original game’s. You will NOT find ultra-hard levels in SMBHF; if you can beat Super Mario Bros, you can beat SMBHF. These levels were created for the gamer’s enjoyment, not for the gamer’s frustration. Each level (1-1 through 8-4) has been changed. Some have been changed moreso than others, but each has been significantly altered.\n\nThe lesser focus of SMBHF is graphic changing. Some major graphic changes include: New floor tile, New underwater tile, New “?” blocks, New brick graphics (Borrowed from SMB2J), and others. There are also some minor graphic changes that you may notice throughout the game.
